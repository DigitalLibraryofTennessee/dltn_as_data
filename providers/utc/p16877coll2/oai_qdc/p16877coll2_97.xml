<dc:title>Church of the Lord Jesus Christ service, 1996 May 25</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hood, Ralph W.; Williamson, W. Paul (William Paul)</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Video recording of a service opening with a brief sermon by Cal porter and singing by John Wayne &#8220;Punkin&#8221; Brown Jr. The congregation, including Carl Porter joins him in song. There are many in attendance and they keep rhythm and dance as the music plays. Carl Porter asks another member of the church to come sing and play guitar. He acquiesces to the request and after a false start, he plays animatedly until he begins to act spasmodically. Other members of the congregation sing and dance while he does this, and Junior McCormick removes a serpent from the box and begins to handle. He quickly hands a serpent to Bill Pelfrey before reaching back into the box for another serpent. Carl Porter speaks briefly during a pause in the music and when he is done, Lydia Hollins sings as Junior McCormick handles serpents and passes them to other members of the church while they dance. McCormick replaces the serpent in its box while another young member of the church removes several smaller serpents and handles. A lull in the music gives way to a laying on of hands by Junior McCormick and Bill Pelfrey. Music and dancing by congregants follow the imposition of hands until a cut in the video breaks to Carl Porter handling as he preaches. He is followed by Brother Kenny who is visiting form Big Stone Gap who preaches and testifies. His testimony is followed by announcements by Carl Porter.</dc:description>
