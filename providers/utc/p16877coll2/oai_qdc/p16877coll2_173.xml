<dc:title>Ulysses Prince sermon, undated</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hood, Ralph W.; Williamson, W. Paul (William Paul)</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Video recording opening with a view of Ulysses Grant Prince preaching to the congregation before singing. Members of the congregation stand up and dance to the music and one man dances while handling fire. The music is followed by an impassioned sermon by an elder of the church. During his sermon the man removes a jar of strychnine and drinks from it to emphasize his point. He is followed by another preacher who speaks from the pulpit. He outlines the rules governing snake handling, strychnine drinking and fire handling. He also gives a brief sermon. When he is done he calls members to prayer and the congregation stands as they call out. More music follows and members clap along to the beat. Several members alternate singing and members of the congregation continue to dance and keep time with the music while several other members handle serpents. Serpent handling and music continue unabated until the recording ends. </dc:description>
