<dc:title>Church of the Lord Jesus service, 1997 August 21</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hood, Ralph W.; Williamson, W. Paul (William Paul)</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Video recording of a service opening with a sound check and members of the congregation conversing. Bob Elkins welcomes everyone to the service and calls congregants to prayer. Members lift their hands in prayer as the music begins. Lydia Hollins is in her usual place at the organ. Her singing opens the service and other members begin to sing as the congregation dances, many in the twirling manner specific to the Church of the Lord Jesus in Jolo, West Virginia. Dewey Chafin handles serpents. After this, other members begin to handle serpents. The music continues and as members begin to handle serpents, several are bitten. Two sermons are delivered by Glenn Dukes and Billy Summerford respectively. Music and dancing begin again and a female member of the congregation is bitten and there is a prayerful response from other members of the congregation as they lay hands on the woman. The music slows, but does not end while they attend to the woman.</dc:description>
