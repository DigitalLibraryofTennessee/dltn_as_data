<dc:title>Church of the Lord Jesus service, 2000 September 2</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hood, Ralph W.; Williamson, W. Paul (William Paul)</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Video recording of a service opening with song. Bob Elkins plays bass, Eileen plays piano, and another member of the congregation sings. The video cuts to a testimony and a sermon by a visiting preacher. He is succeeded by another member of the church who gives testimony. His testimony ends and the music once again fills the church. Congregants take to the floor and dance while Ray &#8220;Bootie&#8221; Christian plays guitar. Members can be seen kneeling on the floor, but the camera is behind a crowd and is blocked from capturing this in detail, and it is unclear why they do this. After the congregants rise, they dance together before the video cuts to a new song. The music gives way to dance and a Melissa Evans handles a serpent. She is followed by others. The dancing and handling continues until the video cuts out.</dc:description>
