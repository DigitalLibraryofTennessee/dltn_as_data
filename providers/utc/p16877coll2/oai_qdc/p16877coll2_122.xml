<dc:creator>Hood, Ralph W.; Williamson, W. Paul (William Paul)</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Video recording of a service opening in the old church building. Carl Porter opens with a prayer. Music quickly follows and members keep rhythm as the music plays. Silas Crawford sings and plays guitar as Carl Porter plays cymbals. Other members sing thereafter and between songs, Carl Porter preaches briefly before Silas Crawford sings and plays again. Others including Jason burn, and James Wade, take up the role of singer as Silas Crawford takes up and handles a serpent. Others who handle include Carl Porter, James Wade, and Phillip Prince who is handling for his first time. Tony testifies after the music ends and the serpents are placed back in their boxes. He is immediately followed by James Wade and Carl Porter who give testimony as well. Carl Porter interposes a sermon in his testimony and it is followed by more testimony and sermons from members of the congregation. When they finish, Silas Crawford sings and plays guitar again and his songs and prayers from the congregation end the video.</dc:description>
