<dc:description>Video recording of a service opening with Bob Elkins calling the congregation to pray for a member and reminding the reporters to be wary of the serpents. Melissa Evans and Eileen play and sing as members come forward to dance. Ray &#8220;Bootie&#8221; Christian plays guitar with several others. As the music plays, members of the church dance in the twirling motion indicative of the church, and others handle serpents. The music comes to a temporary end as a member of the church prays while he handles a rattlesnake. Jeff Hagerman handles a large serpent and is followed by Dewey Chafin and Carl Porter. Bob Elkins preaches to the congregation. His preaching culminates in more music and singing. Congregants, including Bob Elkins dance and sing. Members follow the music with testimony and preaching from a visiting preacher from Kentucky end the recording. </dc:description>
