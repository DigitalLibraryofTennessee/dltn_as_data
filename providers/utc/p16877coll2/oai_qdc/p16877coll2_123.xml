<dc:title>Church of the Lord Jesus Christ service, 2003 July 19</dc:title>

<dc:description>Video recording of a service opening in the old church building. Junior McCormick is pastor and he greets several members of the now small fellowship as they enter. Junior McCormick speaks about the Bible. After his sermon, a woman from the congregation testifies. After her testimony McCormick calls for members to pray and several join him at the altar to do so. When their prayer is over, members gather with instruments to play as Junior McCormick sings. When he finishes, students from Japan and Norway sing. Brice Anderson takes to the pulpit after the song ends and preaches before music once again fills the small church. While members sing, Junior McCormick handles a large rattlesnake. Members stand and keep rhythm as the music continues. Carl Porter plays cymbals and sings. When he steps down, Junior McCormick speaks again. An open Bible is placed on the pulpit before him as he talks about the next service. When he finishes his announcement, he gives the floor to another member who begins a sermon. When the sermon is over, music begins again and as it plays, members come forward to receive the imposition of hands. Testimony from other members and a prayer ends the video.</dc:description>
