<dc:title>Church of the Lord Jesus Christ service, 1995 November 11</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hood, Ralph W.; Williamson, W. Paul (William Paul)</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Video recording of a service opening with music as the large assembly keeps time with tambourines and hands. Billy Lemming plays as Bill Pilfrey sings. As Glen Adkins takes up the microphone to sing, Paul Roberts opens the serpent container and begins to handle. While members are handling, Paul Roberts lays hands on a member of the church. As the camera focuses on the snake handlers,  one member in the background can be seen handling fire. Congregants dance and keep time as the music continues. The music pauses as one woman, an elder from Sand Mountain handles and worships. Music begins again and members continue to handle, dance and sing. After some time, Carl Porter testifies before the congregation. Several members handle as he does. There follows more music, dancing and handling until Carl Porter speaks again. His sermon gives way to Glen Adkins who preaches to the congregation thereafter. His sermon ends with more music and dancing, and he raises a rod and a Bible as members raise their hands in worship. A woman is almost overcome in spirit and Glen Adkins lays hands up on her while she dances with several other women of the congregation. Carl porter can be seen laying hands on members of the congregation as well. Music, dance and imposition of hands continues until the video ends. </dc:description>
