<dc:description>Video recording of a service opening with music being played. Audio quality is poor and can not be discerned in more than short bursts of sound. Bill Pelfrey, Carl Porter, and Junior McCormick all dance at the podium as Billy Lemming sings and plays guitar. Few others dance, but many keep rhythm, clapping along to the beat. Bill Pelfrey testifies and a woman comes to the pulpit and though the audio is still incomprehensible she speaks and gesticulates intensely before returning to her pew. Brenda Brown and Diane Tucker sing and are followed by Joyce Summerford and Spence Evans&#8217; wife. Billy Summerford takes a serpent from the box and handles. He is soon followed by others. Carl Porter lays hands on members of the congregation as the music plays and congregants dance. Several congregants begin a &#8216;victory march&#8217; around the building and this is followed by testimonies from several congregants. However the testimony is marred by the audio problems and is incomprehensible. Spencer Evans gives a sermon which is animated, but likewise unintelligible. His sermon ends with an imposition of hands on several members and he is assisted by Carl Porter and Bill Pelfrey.</dc:description>
