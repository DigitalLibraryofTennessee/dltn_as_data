<dc:title>Church of the True Believers in Jesus' Name service, 1998 April 11</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hood, Ralph W.; Williamson, W. Paul (William Paul)</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Video recording of a service opening with a child singing. His song complete, he returns to his seat as Delphia Nietzel sings. At first her song is slow and melodic, but it soon picks up speed and members of the church begin to stand up and clap along. Other members of the congregation sing as well and as a female duo prepares to sing, a man can be seen kneeling upon his pew in prayer. When the music lulls, Shade Miller testifies. Bill Lemming sings thereafter and Shade Miller handles a serpent while he sings and plays guitar. When he replaces the serpent in its box, he lays hands on members of the congregation. Rayford Dunn lays hands on the same member of the congregation in Miller&#8217;s wake. The music comes to a close and Shade Miller testifies before members come forward to the altar en masse to be blessed and receive an imposition of hands as Billy Lemming signs once again. Members dance and lay hands on one another while the music continues and when the music is done, Glenn Dukes preaches. His sermon ends with more song and he plays guitar with Lemming as he sings. Before long, Dukes preaches again before playing and singing. Rayford Dunn takes up the microphone after Dukes is finished singing. Dunn preaches a sermon to the congregation and like Dukes, he interposes song into his sermons. When his sermon is complete, he asks for prayer for himself and others from members of the church. He finishes by saying that he is trying to open a church in Alabama. Shade Miller invites another member of the congregation to the front to testify. He is followed by Billy Lemming who likewise testifies.</dc:description>
