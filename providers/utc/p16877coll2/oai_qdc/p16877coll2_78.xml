<dc:title>Church of the Lord Jesus service, 1996 March 15</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hood, Ralph W.; Williamson, W. Paul (William Paul)</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Video recording of a service opening with music perfomed by members of the church including Lydia Hollins, Roy &#8220;Bootie&#8221; Christian and Bob Elkins. As they dance, a member of the congregation removes and handles two large serpents at once. Others watch and dance to the music. The music is interrupted by Roy &#8220;Bootie&#8221; Christian handling, but it soon begins again. As they play, Bob Elkins breaks from the bass guitar to lay hands on a member of the congregation. The music breaks for the testimony of Roy &#8220;Bootie&#8221; Christian and others. When it resumes, Lydia Hollins sings and plays organ as Roy "Bootie" Christian plays piano. Another member of the congregation testifies before Bob Elkins takes to the pulpit and delivers an impassioned sermon. His sermon and the video come to a close as music once again fills the church. </dc:description>
