<dc:description>Video recording of a service opening with Carl Porter asking the congregation if they wish to speak aloud their prayers. Several members speak prayers aloud and Carl Porter asks everyone to keep them in their prayers. Fellows of the church then join together in song as Billy Lemming plays guitar. The music pauses and another pastor takes the microphone and preaches. He punctuates his sermon by leading the congregation in song whereupon Junior McCormick removes a serpent from it&#8217;s box and begins to handle. Members of the church keep rhythm, dance and sing as more snakes are removed and passed to other members of the congregation. Soon many are handling, including, Branden Nietzel, Billy Summerford, and Shade Miller. Carl Porter uses a break in the music to pass the collectoin plate around and Junior McCormick testifies and preaches. As he does, he lays hands on members of the congregation. His sermon gives way to more sining, led by Carl Porter. As the music plays several women from the congregation receive an imposition of hands as they dance.    One woman is nearly overcome in spirit and must be held up by her fellows. Carl Porter speaks briefly to the congregation and is succeeded by another pastor who leads yet more singing. Several members testify and Billy Summerfield follows them with a sermon. He is followed by more testimony from the congregation. Carl Porter ends the service by thanking several visiting preachers and a prayer.</dc:description>
