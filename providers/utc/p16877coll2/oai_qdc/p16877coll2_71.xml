<dc:title>Church of the Lord Jesus service, 2001 September 1</dc:title>

<dc:description>Video recording of a service opening with a close up shot of the serpents and their boxes. Bob Elkins warns people who wish to handle the serpents and those recording to stay away from the snakes unless they are prepared. Several preachers from Alabama are visiting. Bill Pelfrey handles a large rattlesnake as the music as do others including Bob Elkins and several women from the congregation. Melissa Evans plays keyboard and Roy &#8220;Bootie&#8221; Christian plays guitar. Lydia Hollins dances with the congregation and Dewey Chafin handles serpents and testifies when the music stops. He thanks God for saving him when he died on the operating table and he says he wants to die by a snakebite when he dies. Following him, one of the visiting preacher from Alabama preaches to the congregation about miracles. His animated testimony ends with him laying hands on members of the congregation. The video cuts out and when it comes back, the blind pianist who sometimes visits Jolo, talks about music and starts the congregation singing as he interposes his testimony. Another of the visiting preachers from Alabama preaches to the congregation and his zeal incites the congregants to stand up in worship. Members sing, dance and lay hands on one another as music plays. Congregants once again take up and handle serpents until the recording ends. </dc:description>
