<dc:description>Video recording of a service opening with Spencer Evans at the pulpit. He welcomes members and outlines the guidelines for handling serpents and drinking strychnine, before asking if anyone has any prayer requests. After members of the church give their requests he informs members about the camera crews which are present. When he is done, members pray at the pulpit and then music starts. Joel Sherbert leads the singing as Billy Lemming plays guitar. When the music ends, Carl Porter testifies. As he concludes his testimony, Bill Pelfrey removes a serpent from its box and Carl Porter, Spencer Evans, Steve Porter, Billy Lemming, Junior McCormick and others handles serpents. As they do this, music begins again. As the tempo builds, members of the church dance and sing along. While the music lays, eight members of the congregation run around the church. While they march, other members begin handling serpents. As one man handles, an elder of the church lays hands on him. Following the music, congregants testify. After their testimony, Spencer Evans testifies and preaches. After his sermon, the video cuts to more music as members come forward to the pulpit to receive the imposition of hands. Following this, the video cuts again to Sister Pelfrey testifying and singing. Her song Gathering Flowers ends the video.</dc:description>
