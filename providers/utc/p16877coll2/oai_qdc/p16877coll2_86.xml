<dc:title>Church of the Lord Jesus Christ service, 1995 September 16</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hood, Ralph W.; Williamson, W. Paul (William Paul)</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Video recording of a service opening with a panoramic view of the congregation as music plays. The video cuts and refocuses on the pulpit where Jamie Coots sings as Billy Lemming plays guitar. Others handle serpents including Bill Pelfrey, Junior McCormick and Carl Porter. Bill Pelfrey can be seen drinking strychnine in the background as a member of the congregation handles a serpent. Glen Adkins, who is handling falls to his knees and is overcome in spirit. He rises and falls to the ground still holding the snake. As members pray over him, the snake is taken and others in the congregation are invited to handle if they wish. A woman handles briefly. As the video continues a man kneels before the pulpit and receives blessings and imposition of hands by elders of the church. The video cuts through several songs before it begins a longer recording of women in the congregation dancing. More snakes are gathered at the pulpit and a members handle again. As the music continues, the man who was previously overcome in spirit dances and sings animatedly. A lull in the music prompts words of praise from Carl Porter before the music begins again and he handles a large serpent and dances. The video cuts at the end of a song, and resumes with Carl Porter preaches to the congregation and testifies.
