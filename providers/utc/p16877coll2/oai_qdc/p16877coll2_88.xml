<dc:title>Church of the Lord Jesus Christ service, 1995 October 21</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hood, Ralph W.; Williamson, W. Paul (William Paul)</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Video recording of a service opening with music and singing lead by Bill Pelfrey and Billy Lemming. As the music plays, members dance, and Junior McCormick comes to the pulpit to pass serpents to others and to handle himself. Carl Porter also handles, as does a woman Shade Miller, Branden Nietzel, Steve Porter, Glen Adkins, and Bobbie Sue Lynn among others. As they handle, some, including Carl Porter, place serpents around their necks. Carl Porter handles a serpent as he testifies before the congregation following a pause in the music. Music plays again as members come to the pulpit to pray before music begins again. Junior McCormick continues to handle as a man member of the congregation lays in the middle of the floor, slain in the spirit. The video cuts and reopens on Carl Porter who is testifying. Music and dancing follow his testimony and as members dance, and children draw at the pews, yet another member of the congregation can be seen upon the floor, slain in spirit. Carl Porter preaches to those assembled, and before he ends, the video cuts to members of the church laying hands on a prone man, who stands and hugs other congregants as they crowd around him. Bill Pelfrey testifies after he walks back to the pews. He is followed by Carl Porter who welcomes David Kimbrough to the front to speak about his research on the church. As he steps down, Carl Porter again speaks to the congregation talking about the origins of the church, before Glen Adkins takes the floor and preaches. His sermon takes the rest of the video.</dc:description>
