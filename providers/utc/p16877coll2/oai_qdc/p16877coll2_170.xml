<dc:title>Bruce Helton's congregation service, undated</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hood, Ralph W.; Williamson, W. Paul (William Paul)</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Video recording of a service opening with music. Members greet one another and the video quality degrades almost immediately. One member rearranges the camera before continuing to sing with the others. After some time, one member removes a serpent form its box and handles as the music plays. He is followed by another member who takes up the serpent when the first man places it down. The camera pans around the room as the music plays and a woman speaks in tongues as she lays hands on a child. The male guitarist hands off his guitar to a female member who plays and sings. As the music continues, several members of the church clap along to the music and the woman who was laying hands on a child earlier dances briefly in front of the camera. Other members of the congregation handle serpents while music continues. As a chorus of congregants sing, a church elder lays hands on a woman in the congregation before returning to the altar. The music ends and a woman can be heard speaking in tongues before it begins again. After a comparatively brief session of music, a member preaches to the congregation. His sermon is impassioned and as he preaches he holds up the bible and approaches members of the congregation as he speaks in a notable speech pattern.</dc:description>
