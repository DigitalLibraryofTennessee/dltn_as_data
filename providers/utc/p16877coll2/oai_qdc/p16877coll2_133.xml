<dc:description>Video recording of a service opening with Jamie Coots calling everyone to get into the service. He prays for the congregation before Mark Brown comes to the altar to sing. Jamie Coots sings as well and the congregation joins him at the front. Many singers come forward including: Sister Coots, Billy Taylor, Linda and Jamie Coots. Many keep rhythm and some dance as the songs continue. Several members of the congregation handle serpents as the music plays and Jimmy Morrow holds a bottle of oil as elders of the church anoint members. Serval come forward and go to their knees before the altar in prayer. While the music continues, Katrina Coots sings as her grandfather Greg Coots plays guitar. Several members use pauses in the music to testify before the congregation as well. Jimmy Morrow preaches to the congregation in his distinctive timbre. More testimony from congregants follows, and Jamie Coots speaks  a final word before calling members to prayer.  </dc:description>
