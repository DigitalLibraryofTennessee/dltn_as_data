<dc:description>Video recording of a service opening with music. Members from the Jolo, West Virginia, Middlesboro, Kentucky, and Sand Mountain, Alabama churches present. Members keep rhythm as the band plays. Joel Sherbert sings after another member of the church testifies. One man goes to his knees and bows before the pulpit as members and camera crews look on. Kirby Hollins is the first to remove a serpent from its box and handle. Others follow in short order. Handlers include Paul Roberts, Billy Summerford, Lary Muncie, John Wayne "Punkin" Brown Jr., Sherman Ward, Joel Sherbet, Carl Porter and others. As members handle and sing, Spencer Evans lays hands on several members. As Joel Sherbet handles, his serpent begins striking. An interlude in the music gives way to testimony from members of the congregation. As music picks up again, members can be seen praying at the pulpit. Jamie Coots sings and Spencer Evans sings backup. Evans, along with Carl Porter also handles a serpent and dances while the music plays. John Wayne "Punkin" Brown Jr., Burce Helton, Jamie Coots and Billy Summerford&#8217;s testimony ends the video.</dc:description>
