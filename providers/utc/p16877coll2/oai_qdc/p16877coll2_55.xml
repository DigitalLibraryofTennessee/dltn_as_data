<dc:creator>Hood, Ralph W.; Williamson, W. Paul (William Paul)</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Video recording of a service lead by Bob Elkins who speaks about scripture and serpent handling. Dewey Chafin plays and sings a song to the congregation. After he finishes, a female member of the congregation sings and testifies. Following this, another female member of the congregation takes the pulpit to lead the congregation in song and testify.&#160;Thereafter, Dewey Chafin preaches a sermon to the assembly. This song precedes and follows after the sermon. The music gives way to dancing among the congregants and a few members begin handling serpents. When the serpents are returned to their enclosures, Barb Elkins speaks and welcomes a member to the congregation and speaks about those recording the sermon. She gives testimony about persecution and suffering for one&#8217;s beliefs. There follows a prayer which ends the service. The video recording continues with another service which opens with singing, and a prayer lead by Bob Elkins. Music and dancing follow the prayer and several members of the congregation handle serpents. During a later portion of music and singing there is an imposition of hands on a member of the congregation. Music and dancing continue until the end of the service where a member gives testimony. </dc:description>
