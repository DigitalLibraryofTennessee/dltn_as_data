<dc:title>Church of the Lord Jesus Christ service, 1996 September 7</dc:title>

<dc:description>Video recording of a service opening with Carl Porter speaking briefly before music plays and Bill Pelfrey sings. When the music pauses, Carl Porter returns to the front to testify and preach. He ends his sermon with a song, and as he sings, members come forward to raise hands and sing with him. One member can be seen on his knees bowing in worship before the altar. As the music continues, Carl Porter and others handles serpents while members dance. As this continues, one woman sits at the altar as another woman kneels with her. Others lay hands on the sitting woman. The music pauses, and at least one member can be heard speaking in tongues. Carl Porter handles a serpent while he speaks to the congregation. Others, including a trio of women sing as members gather at the pulpit following Porter&#8217;s brief speech. When the music&#8217;s tempo picks up, members dance and some receive an imposition of hands. Members begin handling again thereafter. Following the music, Brice Anderson testifies before the congregation, ending the recording. </dc:description>
