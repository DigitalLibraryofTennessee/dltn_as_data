<dc:description>Video recording of a service opening with singing and music by Billy Lemming. The video then cuts to Carl Porter singing. Members of the church dance and keep rhythm as he sings. The video cuts several times in sequence, and reestablishes itself as Carl Porter brings out two serpents from their enclosure and handles as he dances. He hands one to another member of the church who likewise dances and handles.  Just before he passes off the serpent to another member of the church the man who received the snake form Carl Porter places the snake around his shoulders. After giving the serpent up briefly, he again takes the serpent and both he and Carl Porter begin to handle the snakes in a less gentle manner.  As the music continues, more congregants handle and one, after handling goes to a fellow congregant and places his hands upon him. Porter takes more serpents from their enclosure and handles. Billy Lemming sets aside his guitar for a chance to handle as he sings. After the music comes to an end, Carl Porter testifies before the congregation and gives a sermon as the serpents are put back in their box. The video cuts and reopens on more singing. A woman approaches Porter to have her child blessed by the elders of the church. After the child is handed to a fellow of the church, the woman receives a blessing and imposition of hands from Carl Porter. Members, including a young child dance as blessings are received by other congregants, who are anointed with oil and receive the imposition of hands while the preachers and their fellow congregants pay for them. As the blessings and music continue, a woman, who is slain in spirit collapses to the ground. A covering is placed on her and as the video progresses, she can be seen recovered. </dc:description>
