<dc:creator>Hood, Ralph W.; Williamson, W. Paul (William Paul)</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Video recording of a service opening with singing and dancing. Members from the Church of the Lord Jesus in Jolo, West Virginia and Full Gospel Tabernacle in Jesus' Name in Middlesboro, Kentucky are present. Glen Adkins sings on the stage with pastor Bill Pelfrey. As they sing, pastor Junior McCormick opens the box containing serpents and begins to handle. It is not long before he hands several snakes out to other members of the congregation, and many people handle while dancing. During a lull in the music a Junior McCormick preaches to the assembly.  The video cuts to a song led by Sister Pelfrey at the pulpit. Following her song, members again take up serpents and Jamie Coots testifies animatedly to the congregation as he handles a large snake as the music begins to pick up speed. Others handles and as Glen Adkins handles, he convulses and almost collapses as he is overcome in spirit,. The recording cuts after he hands the serpent back to another member of the church.</dc:description>
