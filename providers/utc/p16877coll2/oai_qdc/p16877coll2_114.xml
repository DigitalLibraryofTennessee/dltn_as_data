<dc:description>Video recording of a service opening with a man named Tony speaking to the congregation and taking prayer requests from congregants. Members of the church speak up in turn and when all who have prayers have spoken, Tony invites members up to the altar to pray. Many in attendance do so and afterward, Tony plays guitar and sings a short, slow song before giving the floor to Junior McCormick who testifies and sings. As he sings, several members of the church rise and dance. As the music ends, a member of the church speaks loudly in tongues and this causes several members to pray. She continues for some time, and when she is finished, Junior McCormick speaks again before Carl Porter comes forward to sing and testify. As he sings, Junior McCormick handles a serpent and members dance While Virgil Porter plays harmonica. Brice Anderson drinks strychnine, and after the singing, he takes to the pulpit and asks members to open their Bibles as he preaches. At the end of his sermon, he calls members of the church to the altar for prayer.  </dc:description>
