<dc:title>Church of the Lord Jesus Christ service, 1996 February 23</dc:title>

<dc:description>Video recording of a service opening with Carl Porter addressing the congregation and assigning placements, and addressing the guidelines governing handling serpents and drinking strychnine. He asks members to pray for a young girl who is injured, and asks if anyone else has prayer requests. He gives a brief sermon before Billy Lemming begins to play guitar and members of the congregation sing. Junior McCormick takes serpents from the box and begins handling one in each hand before passing one on to another member of the congregation. Others handle and Junior McCormick picks up a cluster of serpents and testifies. Music and handling continues until Carl Porter preaches. His sermon ends with congregation singing. During the song Junior McCormick is bitten as he handles multiple serpents. Carl Porter preaches to the congregation again and handles a serpent. More music follows and a pause allows Junior McCormick to testify before the congregation. As music again fills the room, members gather at the pulpit to lay hands on a member. Carl Porter asks Misty Williamson who is visiting the congregation to sing. She acquiesces and sings Amazing Grace. Following her song, members testify. After the testimony, two congregants drink strychnine.</dc:description>
