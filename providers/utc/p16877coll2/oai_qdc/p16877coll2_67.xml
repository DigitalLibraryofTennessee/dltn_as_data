<dc:title>Church of the Lord Jesus service, 1999 September 4</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Hood, Ralph W.; Williamson, W. Paul (William Paul)</dc:creator>
<dc:description>Video recording of an evening homecoming service opened by Bob Elkins testifying. It is the first homecoming since Barb Elkins&#8217; death. As Bob Elkins brings his testimony to a close, music begins and members of the congregation begin to dance while Roy &#8220;Bootie&#8221; Christian plays guitar. Some congregants dance in the hallmark twirling style of the church. Dewey and other members of the congregation handle serpents.  Dewey handles several rattlesnakes simultaneously, and, as the music ends, he addresses the congregation. As he gives his address, members of the congregation handle serpents. Following this, Lydia Hollins and Roy "Bootie" Christian once again take to their instruments and lead the congregation in song. Bob Elkins speaks passionately in defense of the church, and ends by passing the microphone to another member of the congregation who gives his own testimony. While he speaks, a female member of the church handles serpents. The music ends and Jeff Hagerman preaches and handles serpents. The video ends with Lydia Hollins singing and playing the organ.  </dc:description>
