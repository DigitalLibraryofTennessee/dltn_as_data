    <title>Church of the Lord Jesus Christ service, 1996 April 4</title>
  </titleInfo>
  <abstract>Video recording of a service opening with music. Singing is led by Bill Pelfrey. There are few in attendance. It is not long before the singing comes to an end and Carl Porter speaks. As he does, he places prayer cloths on the pulpit and asks if anyone has any prayer requests. Bill Pelfrey preaches a short sermon thereafter and leads the congregation in song. He follows his song with more preaching. A man is helped to the pulpit where Carl Porter and Bill Pelfrey anoint him with oil and many members come forward to pray over him. Carl Porter follows this with a sermon after which, Bobbie Sue Lynn sings. Porter follows the song with one of his own and as he sings, Billy Summerford takes up a serpent. Others quickly follow. Carl Porter follows this singing and handling with testimony after which he yields the microphone to Spencer Evans who preaches and later in his sermon handles serpents.</abstract>
