    <title>Church of the Lord Jesus service, 1999 September 6</title>
  </titleInfo>
  <abstract>Video recording of a Sunday service opening with singing. Though the attendance is low, the members who are present dance and handle serpents. Men and women alike handle including Lydia Hollins, Dewey Chafin, and Roy “Bootie” Christian. During an interlude in the music, Dewey Chafin testifies before the congregation, and invites members to worship and be welcome. Lydia Hollins takes up the organ and sings as the next round of music begins. She is joined by a visitor to the church, who is blind, but provides keyboard accompaniment throughout the service. Barb Elkins, once again in her wheelchair, plays tambourine. As the music progresses, the camera focuses on the players and viewers are given a close up view of Lydia Hollins as she plays. Larry Muncie sings and preaches on the topic of Amazing Grace, and pays homage to Bob and Barb Elkins for their roles in the church. There follows music and testimony from members of the congregation, including the blind guest pianist. Following the spoken and sung testimony, the mic is given to Barb Elkins who addresses the congregation and gives her testimony. After members give their testimony, Bob Elkins honors members of the church for their help over the years. After his address, Lydia Hollins takes up the organ and sings once more. Roy Christian testifies and asks a member of the congregation named Eileen to sing a song. Her singing brings the video to an end. This is the last service for Barb Elkins before her death.</abstract>
