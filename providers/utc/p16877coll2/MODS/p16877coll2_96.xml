    <title>Church of the Lord Jesus Christ service, 1996 May 24</title>
  </titleInfo>
  <abstract>Video recording of a service opening with Lydia Hollins playing organ and singing as parishioners filter in. Barb and Bob Elkins are in attendance. Members carry snakes into the building and when they are set up Carl Porter welcomes everyone as members pray at their pews. Music and singing follow and church members join in, keeping rhythm on tambourines or by clapping along. Some members dance. As the video cuts to another song, one man can be seen lying face down on the floor, overcome in spirit. Carl porter testifies between songs and leads singing as the music begins again. The man on the floor is now recovered. Bill Pelfrey speaks briefly in a lull in the music as the serpent boxes are set out and brief sound check is performed before John Wayne “Punkin” Brown Jr. plays guitar and sings. One guitarist testifies during the next lull. Carl Porter speaks briefly and Lydia Hollins sings. Porter speaks and outlines the rules for handling and drinking strychnine. He is followed by a pair of singers who quickly involve the congregation in the song they sing. Carl Porter and others handle shortly thereafter as the music plays. Many men and women handle in this service. Ethel Miller, Ruby Jewel, Lucille Chruch and Barb Elkins are among the women who handle. Dewey Chafin, Shade Miller, Gene and Joel Sherbert, Bob Elkins, Buddy Jewel, Brice Anderson, Billy Summerford, Bill Pelfrey and Carl Porter are among the serpent handlers. Carl Porter lays a serpent on the ground and walks across it at times placing his full weight upon the serpent. He then picks up the serpent which remains docile throughout. He follows with testimony before the congregation, handling the serpent all the while. Porter is not gentle with the serpent as he slings it across his shoulders. The serpent remains docile despite this relatively rough treatment by Porter. Following this he hands the serpent to a young man as music plays again. Carl Porter invites Bob Elkins, who preaches passionately to the congregate, to the pulpit to preach. His sermon receives applause as he concludes and Spencer Evans takes to the pulpit to extemporize on a passage of the Bible. He is succeeded by Gene Sherbert.</abstract>
