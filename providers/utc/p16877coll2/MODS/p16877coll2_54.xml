  </titleInfo>
  <abstract>Video recording of a service lead by Bob Elkins. This recording contains two services. The first service opens with Bob Elkins welcoming fellow preachers from other churches who are joining this evening’s service. There follows singing and dancing the audio quality of the film is compromised and mostly unintelligible at first, but improves. During the singing a member of the congregation handles a serpent. Music and dancing continue and more members of the church begin to handle serpents and the music gives way to an impassioned sermon by a member of the church. A member of the congregation named Darlene testifies. Following the testimony, the congregation sings “I Know the Master of the Wind” after which the guitarist stands at the pulpit and testifies. Music begins again, and when it ends, Barb Elkins stands and testifies.  The first service ends with a word from Bob Elkins. The second service, led by Bob Elkins opens the service with a prayer. Music follows, and Dewey Chafin leads the congregation in song whereupon many members of the congregation begin to dance. While this occurs, several members of the congregation begin to handle serpents.  Barb Elkins testifies about music and worship. Chafin talks about snake handling traditions and the perception of it in popular culture. He emphasizes that it is “not for show.” He attests that he has been bitten 106 times and speaks of the pain he and others have endured. The sermon closes with Bob and Barb Elkins giving short speeches on bites and Bob Elkins speaks about scripture and serpent handling.</abstract>
