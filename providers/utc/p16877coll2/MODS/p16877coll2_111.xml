    <title>Church of the Lord Jesus Christ service, 1998 May 24</title>
  </titleInfo>
  <abstract>Video recording of a service opening with music and singing by a visitor from Sand Mountain, Alabama. As he sings, members of the congregation keep rhythm and dance. After the visitor sings a few songs, Joyce Summerford takes her place at the pulpit to sing. As song rings out in the church, Billy Summerford removes a serpent from its box and handles. He is shortly followed by Carl Porter. Other members of the church begin to handle as well, including Jamie Coots, and James Wade. As they handle, James Wade dances while handling a hand full of serpents; whipping some across his back as he does. He hands part of the group of snakes to another member who dances with them in similar fashion. Serpents are handed about and handled by various members for a few minutes as a member of the congregation sings. The women of the church dance and keep rhythm on tambourines as the men play music, sing and handle. The exceptions to this are Lucille Church who sings and plays keyboard, Cynthia Church and Lidia Coots Church who dance and handle serpents when Carl Porter offers one to them. One serpent is left on the pulpit rail and it lays idly while the cacophonous music continues around it. The music stops and Carl Porter preaches to the congregation briefly before handing the microphone to a female member of the congregation who sings. Jamie Coots testifies and sings after her and his song is more subdued. The pattern continues with other members of the congregation alternatively singing, testifying or both. Brice Anderson and Carl Porter are among those who testify or sing. Near the end of the video opens the floor to a man who testifies and asks the congregation to pray for him. Carl Porter sings briefly thereafter and the music ends the video.</abstract>
