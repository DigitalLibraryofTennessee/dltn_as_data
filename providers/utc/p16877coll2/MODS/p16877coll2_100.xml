  <abstract>Video recording of a service opening with an interview with a member of the congregation who has medical tape on his arm being interviewed after a surgery which allowed him to keep his arm after a snake bite. He shows his scars and tells the interviewer that they cut his arm all the way open. Hey says that it was almost four weeks since he was bit. He spent nine days in the hospital. He provides the interviewer with his experience near death and expands on his beliefs, fears and hopes. He has handled serpents since his surgery. The video cuts after the interviewer asks the manâ€™s wife Christina if she was present on the day he was bit. When the video cuts back on, Carl Porter is opening the service. After welcoming everyone, he leads the congregation in song. The man who was interviewed in the beginning segment is present and he dances bare footed. As the music continues, others sing and members of the congregation lay hands on one of their fellows. Carl Porter removes a serpent from its box and handles as yet another congregant sings at the pulpit. He hands the serpent to Spencer Evans. Billy Summerford and others handle as well. A pause in the music is filled with testimony by other members including the man who was interviewed in the opening segment and Brice Anderson. During his testimony, Members lay hands on one another. Music begins again and members dance and receive an imposition of hands. Aunt Daisy lays hands on members. Brice Anderson does likewise. One woman can be heard speaking in tongues. The woman receives an imposition of hands from Brice Anderson and others. Following this another member of the congregation testifies and when he is done, music and handling begin again. Bill Pelfrey sings to the congregation and walks about them while he sings. He follows with a sermon. His sermon and testimony ends and Carl Porter comes forward to list birthdays.</abstract>
