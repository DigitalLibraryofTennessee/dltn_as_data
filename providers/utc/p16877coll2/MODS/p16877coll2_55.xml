  </titleInfo>
  <abstract>Video recording of a service lead by Bob Elkins who speaks about scripture and serpent handling. Dewey Chafin plays and sings a song to the congregation. After he finishes, a female member of the congregation sings and testifies. Following this, another female member of the congregation takes the pulpit to lead the congregation in song and testify. Thereafter, Dewey Chafin preaches a sermon to the assembly. This song precedes and follows after the sermon. The music gives way to dancing among the congregants and a few members begin handling serpents. When the serpents are returned to their enclosures, Barb Elkins speaks and welcomes a member to the congregation and speaks about those recording the sermon. She gives testimony about persecution and suffering for one’s beliefs. There follows a prayer which ends the service. The video recording continues with another service which opens with singing, and a prayer lead by Bob Elkins. Music and dancing follow the prayer and several members of the congregation handle serpents. During a later portion of music and singing there is an imposition of hands on a member of the congregation. Music and dancing continue until the end of the service where a member gives testimony.</abstract>
