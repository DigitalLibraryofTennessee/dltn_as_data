  <abstract>Video recording of a service opening with Brice Anderson preaching to the congregation. His sermon concludes with a prayer and members come to kneel before the altar with their own prayer as he speaks. When the prayers come to an end, Tony, Carl Porter and a female member of the congregation sing at the altar. Aunt Daisy is in attendance. She comes before the altar to pray several times as the music plays. Carl Porter takes a serpent form the box and handles. He hands the serpent to Brice Anderson who handles for a few moments before handing it back to Carl Porter. Tony stops playing guitar to pick up and handle a serpent as well. Charles McGlocklin handles briefly as well. Carl Porter handles two snakes for a time but before long he is bitten, and drops one. He hands the other off, and picks up the dropped serpent to place it back in the container before stepping back to receive prayers and an imposition of hands from several elders of the church. Members come to the altar and kneel in prayer as Carl Porter walks back and forth across the pulpit. Singing continues and many members join in and lead the singing. When the music ends, Brice Anderson speaks and introduces a guest preacher, an Indian missionary who preaches. Brice Anderson follows him and speaks after the visitor has finished his sermon. As he preaches he announces that Carl Porter has requested an ambulance and will leave for the hospital. As he preaches he invites members to come forward to pray at the altar. Many do, and as they kneel, Anderson continues to speak and Tony plays guitar and sings a slow melodic song. The service closes and the congregation goes down to the river to preform a baptism. Brice Anderson stands in the river and explains the gravity of the ceremony before asking Brother Billy, to lead the congregation in prayer. A woman is helped to the water and Tony and Brice Anderson hold her steady before Anderson begins the ceremony, but he takes the ceremony a step further and casts out her demons before she is baptized. She is helped from the river and as she and the preachers dry off the video comes to an end.</abstract>
