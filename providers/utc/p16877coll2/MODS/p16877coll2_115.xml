    <title>Church of the Lord Jesus Christ service, 1999 May 29</title>
  </titleInfo>
  <abstract>Video recording of a service opening with a sermon and testimony by Brice Anderson. The church has guest members attending from an unspecified Black congregation. Music quickly begins and members and visitors to the church stand and clap along. Members dance and handle serpents as the music continues and Paul Roberts, Junior McCormick and Lydia Hollins are among the first to do so. When the music stops, Carl Porter testifies while holding a serpent. His testimony comes to an end and music once again fills the church. A member of the congregation joins in on harmonica as members keep rhythm an dance. When next the music stops, visiting preachers come forward and once they are arranged, they begin to play and sing. As they do, members of both congregations come forward to sing and worship at the front of the church. Between songs, one of the visiting preachers says a prayer at the altar. His prayer is followed by Lydia Hollins on keyboard and music by another member of the church. Their song is followed by testimonies from members of the congregation and from visiting members of other churches. One visiting preacher preaches and is met with a standing ovation as he finishes his sermon. Another visiting preacher begins more music and members of the choir sing harmony and backup for him. When his song is complete, he preaches to the assembly and receives affirmations from the gathered believers. Carl Porter speaks briefly before dismissing the congregation and ending the recording.</abstract>
