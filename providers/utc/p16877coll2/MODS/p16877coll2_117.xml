    <title>Church of the Lord Jesus Christ service, 2000 April 8</title>
  </titleInfo>
  <abstract>Video recording of a service opening with the testimony of Brice Anderson in front of a small congregation. As he finishes his testimony, Tony (last name unavailable) comes to the altar and plays while singing with another female member of the congregation. Other members of the church keep rhythm with tambourines. Junior McCormick follows their song with his own before testifying before the congregation. When he sings again, Virgil Porter can be seen accompanying him on harmonica. The music comes to an end and Carl Porter comes to the altar to speak. After a brief speech, music begins again and Carl Porter sings. When he finishes singing female member Diane Tucker and another female member take up the role of singer. As the second female member sings, Junior McCormick and Carl Porter pick up serpents and handle. Junior McCormick places one serpent on the pulpit rail before picking it back up. Brice Anderson, Tony, Louis Hobbs, and Diane Tucker all handle. Members come forward to place donations for the church in a basket as Tony plays and sings. The film cuts to Brice Anderson preaching to the congregation. As he speaks he comes forward from the pulpit and addresses congregants directly as he continues his sermon. Music begins again as he calls members to pray. Several approach the altar and kneel while music softly plays. The music picks up tempo and members stand with hands upraised before the altar or kneel in prayer while the songs play. Tonyâ€™s singing ends the video.</abstract>
