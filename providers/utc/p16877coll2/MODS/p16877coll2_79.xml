    <title>Church of the Lord Jesus service, 1994 September</title>
  </titleInfo>
  <abstract>Video recording of a service opening with relative quiet as members file into the church. The camera cuts to an outside view of the chruch as members continue to arrive. A woman hands a baby to Barb Elkins and Bob looks on while Lydia Hollins plays organ and sings. Music continues as members socialize. A close shot of Dewey Chafinâ€™s hand reveals some swelling as he walks around the church and speaks. Bob Elkins addresses the church and tells them about the guidelines regarding serpent handling, concluding with a warning. He then calls congregants to prayer. After the prayer, members dance and Lydia Hollins handles a large serpent. The dancing is followed by more serpent handling by other members of the church. One member handles a large cluster of snakes before handing them to Dewey Chafin. The music dies down as Bob Elkins again calls for members to pray. The prayer ends and music once again fills the church. Members of the church dance, many in the twirling style of Jolo. The video cuts and reopens on a sermon by another preacher named Paul who ends his sermon by leading the congregation in song. Carl Porter introduces a member to the congregation and again there follows dancing and singing. Carl Porter handles serpents and other congregants join him. Carl Porter continues his sermon and alternates between music and preaching, until Barb Elkins takes the microphone and addresses the congregation. This is followed by a brief testimony from another member and more song and serpent handling until another member testifies. After he finishes, congregants pray and more music follows. Dewey Chafin handles serpents and testifies between songs. More members take up serpents and dance. More testimony alternates between music and once again Pastor Paul addresses the congregation. More song, dancing and handling follows and continues until the video ends.</abstract>
