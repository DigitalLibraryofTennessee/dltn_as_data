    <title>Fort Wayne, Indiana congregation service, undated</title>
  </titleInfo>
  <abstract>Video recording opening with a member of the church playing guitar. The music and singing continues and is only briefly interrupted by a member of the church speaking before beginning again. As the music continues a member of the congregation removes several serpents from their enclosure and dances as he handles them. The music lulls and a man speaks to members of the church and testifies. When he is done, music and serpent handling begin again. Another lull in the music reveals a man speaking in tongues before another singer comes forward. Members come forward to pray at the altar and several lay hands on one another as they come forward. Though the music continues, one man holds a microphone and testifies. He is incomprehensible due to the poor sound quality and music. Another member of the church stands as the pulpit and testifies during a brief pause in song. He follows his testimony with song. Another member testifies during a final lull in the music. His testimony and a final set of songs end the recording.</abstract>
