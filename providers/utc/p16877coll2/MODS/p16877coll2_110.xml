    <title>Church of the Lord Jesus Christ service, 1998 May 22</title>
  </titleInfo>
  <abstract>Video recording of a service opening with Carl Porter speaking to the congregation and calling them to prayer. Members pray at the pulpit and in their pews. Following the prayer, Carl Porter sings as members clap along. There are few in attendance and the service is not as lively as usual. After the music halts, Carl Porter preaches to the congregation and there follows more music. Another lull in the music presents Carl Porter with the opportunity to invite a man named Charlie (last name possibly Beal) to sing. He comes forward and testifies with zeal before launching into song. His singing is interspersed with sermon. As he finishes he is hugged by two members of the congregation as Carl Porter once again takes up the microphone to give thanks and sing. He punctuates his singing with another sermon. Carl Porter handles briefly as members begin to sing and testify, and the congregation stands up to dance as the tempo of the music picks up. The music stops as a female congregant speaks in tongues. The camera focuses on her as she drops to her knees with a hand outstretched; overcome in spirit. She is succeeded by another woman who begins to speak in tongues and the camera focuses on her as she stands, hunched over. She continues as another member begins to sing which ends the video.</abstract>
