  </titleInfo>
  <abstract>Video recording of a service opening with Carl Porter leading the congregation in prayer. Barb and Bob Elkins and many others from Jolo, West Virginia, Middlesboro, Kentucky, and Sand Mountain, Alabama are in attendance. Music begins promptly following the prayer, and many people from the congregation stand and keep rhythm as the musicians play. Jamie Coots sings and Carl Porter speaks to the congregation during a lull in the music. It is not long before members of the church begin handling serpents. Buddy Jewel removes the first from the box and he is quickly followed by others including: Junior McCormick, Billy Summerford, Lydia Hollins, Larry Muncie, John Wayne "Punkin" Brown Jr., Joel Sherbert and others. As the music plays, a congregat begins to testify and preach. Carl Porter handles a large serpent and offers it to a woman who handles briefly before returning it. Spencer Evans handles a large serpent as he sings and testifies. The music pauses and a sound-check is preformed as Bob Elkins testifies and asks to be remembered in the congregationâ€™s prayers. Carl Porter says a few words before turning the microphone over to Jamie Coots who testifies. He is again followed by Carl Porter who likewise testifies before the congregation. Much music and dancing follows his testimony. As this continues a man approaches the pulpit to receive an imposition of hands form Carl Porter and Spencer Evans. A woman can be heard in the background speaking in tongues. The music continues until the end of the video where Bill Pelfrey speaks briefly before the music concludes the video.</abstract>
