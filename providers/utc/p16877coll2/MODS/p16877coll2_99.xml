  </titleInfo>
  <abstract>Video recording of a service opening with Carl Porter who fixes microphone cords and arranges a box with a serpent before he begins. He welcomes everyone and asks that they turn their minds to God before asking the congregation to stand for the Lordâ€™s Prayer. He follows this with a warning about serpents and strychnine. Porter also welcomes Arnold Saylor who has driven down from Indiana to be at the service. Carl Porter begins to sing as Billy Lemming plays guitar and many members of the congregation keep rhythm. Other singers take over as the music continues. Arnold Saylor exhorts and sings as well. Carl Porter starts a prayer and passes the collection plate around before he begins his sermon. This sermon ends with more song and guitar by Billy Lemming. While the music continues, Carl Porter removes a serpent from its enclosure and handles. He is followed by Shade Miller and his wife Ethel Miller. The music gives way to the testimony of several members of the church including Carl Porter and Arnold Saylor among others. A congregant speaks in tongues after Saylor's testimony. Bill Pelfrey takes up the microphone and preaches.</abstract>
