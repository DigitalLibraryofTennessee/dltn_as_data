  </titleInfo>
  <abstract>Video recording of a service opening with the testimony of Bobbie Smart. He leads the service into its opening prayer. Billy Lemming plays guitar and sings during a break in Smartâ€™s testimony. Bobbie Smart finishes his testimony and Carl Porter takes to the pulpit to speak to the congregation and outline the rules governing serpent handling and imbibing strychnine before music begins again. As it plays, Junior McCormick takes a serpent from its box and handles. Carl Porter follows suit. After the music stops another member of the congregation testifies. During the testimony the congregation comes to the pulpit to receive blessings and one man convulses wildly as he is over come in spirit. He can be heard speaking in tongues as Bobbie Smart lays hands on various members of the congregation. Billy Lemming plays guitar and sings as this occurs. The imposition of hands continues as more members of the church receive and lay hands on one another. After this laying on of hands ends, more members of the congregation testify. One guest member testifies while holding a serpent. Carl Porter can be seen handling behind him as he testifies John Wayne "Punkin" Brown Jr. likewise handles and testifies.</abstract>
