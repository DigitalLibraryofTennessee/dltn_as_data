  </titleInfo>
  <abstract>Video recording of a service opening with Carl Porter leading the congregation in song. Louis Hobbs dances as Larry Pelfrey plays guitar. During a break in the music, Carl Porter testifies. His testimony ends with him again leading the congregation in song. A break in the video shows a member of the congregation as he prays at the pulpit he stands and takes a seat in the front of the church as Carl Porter begins to preach to the congregation. Music follows, and during a lull, the man playing drums testifies. He is obfuscated by the pulpit and crash symbol, but his arms are visible as he tells members to “get in here and do it right.” As he makes his demand, three female members of the church, Diane Tucker, Fanny Bell Baker, and Crystal Tucker, come forward and sing while keeping rhythm on tambourines. Following their song, more members of the congregation testify including Carl Porter, Billy Summerford, Brice Anderson, James Wade, Junior McCormick, and a visitor from Alabama named Charles who preaches and testifies. Music follows and Joyce Summerford sings. As she does, Billy Summerford removes a serpent and handles. Carl Porter, Steve Porter, Louis Hobbs, and James Wade handle as well. As the music continues, Carl Porter prays for and anoints church members. James Wade testifies again.</abstract>
