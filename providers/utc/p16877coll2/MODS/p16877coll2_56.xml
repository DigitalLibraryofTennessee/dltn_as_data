    <title>Church of the Lord Jesus service, 1995 September 3</title>
  </titleInfo>
  <abstract>Video recording of a service which begins with footage outside the church. There is a short viewing of Joloâ€™s church regulations as the setup for the service is conducted. A brief cut of the film reopens with music in which Bob Elkins plays guitar, with musical and vocal accompaniment. Members of the congregation dance in a twirling motion and many others keep rhythm with hands or tambourines. Bob Elkins briefly give a sermon before the video cuts back to music and dance. During a brief interlude in the music, many members of the congregation bring out and begin to handle serpents, whereupon the music continues with members still handling serpents and dancing. The music stops and the serpents are placed back in their enclosures. Bob Elkins gives a sermon as he drinks from a jar of strychnine whereupon he calls for some of the other preachers in attendance to come to the pulpit. There is a cut in the film which reopens with more singing and dancing. During an interlude another preacher praises God. There follows more dancing and a member of the congregation handles fire. There is more serpent handling and one man handles several serpents at one time. Barb Elkins testifies.</abstract>
