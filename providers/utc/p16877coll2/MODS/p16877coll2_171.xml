  <abstract>Video recording opening with a member handling a serpent as members sing and play instruments. A female member of the congregation handles shortly thereafter. The singer handles after her and continues to sing while so doing. In the background the first member to handle lights a kerosene bottle and handles fire. More members handle serpents as the fire-handling member hands off one of his bottles to a woman who dances while she handles. The serpents are replaced and music continues as members come forward to lay hands on a member who falls to the ground, slain in spirit. More members receive an imposition of hands thereafter. One woman shouts and walks around the room whipping her head up and down while two other women lay hands on each other over the slain man. Preachers come forward to lay hands on still more members and as the music ends, the slain man sits up. A cut in the video refocuses on a duet preformed by members of the congregation. More members take turns playing and singing. Serpents are removed again and handed around to be handled by several members who dance with them in hand. When the serpents are replaced, members again receive an imposition of hands as members speak in tongues and pray. More fire handing, serpent handling, and song follows the interlude. Between songs, a woman can be heard repeating I praise you lord as she walks to her place in the pews. Music and serpent handling continues until the video ends.</abstract>
