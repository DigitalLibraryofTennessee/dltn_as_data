    <title>Church of the Lord Jesus Christ service, 1995 February 4</title>
  </titleInfo>
  <abstract>Video recording of a service that begins with members gathered together and praying at the pew while congregants lay hands on one another. Billy Lemming sings and plays guitar as the pastors lay hands on members. Many members dance and some sway with hands upraised as the music fills the church. As they dance, several congregants shake and convulse where they stand. Carl Porter holds his hands to his head as if in pain as he dances. Many other members dance and some continue to convulse as they do so. As music continues, several members begin to handle serpents, including Billy Lemming and Carl Porter. Members continue to dance and receive blessings from pastors and fellow congregants. The music stops as Carl Porter begins to preach. In the middle of the sermon, he begins to dance and handles a large serpent briefly before continuing. As he speaks, Bill Pelfrey drinks strychnine. Carl Porter ends his sermon and delivers a general address to the congregation about upcoming church events before inviting another member, brother Floyd to the pulpit to sing. The video cuts back to Carl Porter preaching once again. He welcomes a member of the congregation to the front and they sing ‘Happy Birthday’ to her as members come to wish her well. Carl Porter welcomes another member and he preaches to the congregation about redemption. Following his sermon, members of the congregation testify. Bill Pelfrey then takes up the microphone and preaches and speaks in tongues. This gives way to an animated sermon and testimony by Bill Pelfrey which culminates with the congregation rising and breaking out in dance as music begins. Pelfrey continues to incite the congregation with zealous speech and dance. During a lull in the music, Bill palfrey continues to preach and invigorate the crowd and he testifies again before reading from the Bible. As he preaches, he handles fire and speaks about the power granted to elders of the church in scripture. His sermon closes and Carl Porter ends the service with a prayer.</abstract>
