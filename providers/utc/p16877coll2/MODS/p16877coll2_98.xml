    <title>Church of the Lord Jesus Christ service, 1996 May 26</title>
  </titleInfo>
  <abstract>Video recording of a service opening with Jamie Coots singing after a brief sermon by another member of the church cuts off. Members from Morristown, Tennessee, Sand Mountain, Alabama, and Middlesboro, Kentucky are in attendance. Many keep rhythm on tambourines while other members dance. Bill Pelfrey joins the singing and tells the congregation to praise the Lord. As the music continues, members of the church lay hands on other members. While the music plays, Junior McCormick removes a serpent from its box and handles. After a short time, other members of the church begin to handle. Those who handle include: Gene Sherbert, Bill Pelfrey and his wife, Carl Porter, Joel Sherbert, Brother Kenny of Big Stone Gap, Billy Summerford, Carl Turner, Shade Miller, Ethel Miller, Spencer Evans and his wife, Verlin Short, J. L. Dyal, Punkin Brown Delphia Nietzel, Brice Anderson, Bobbie Sue Lynn, Diane Tucker, Brenda Brown, Alan Williams, and Arnold Saylor of Indiana. As the music and handling continue, many members receive an imposition of hands. Billy Summerford places a serpent on the ground and walks upon it. The music pauses as Carl Porter welcomes visiting members from other churches, informs members of events which will occur, including baptism opportunities, when food will be served. He also informs the congregation that a wedding will take place after the service. He also introduces Brother Henry who testifies. He is followed by others who preach and testify as well. A member who traveled far to attend starts more singing. As they sing, Spencer Evans drinks strychnine. Others receive the imposition of hands, and others begin to handle serpents. Carl Porter attends to a serpent which is shedding, removing its old skin before replacing it in the box. Spencer Evans can be seen on his knees as the singing continues. The video cuts to another song, and he is standing again. The camera pans to the congregation and the bride who is to be wed at the church at 2:00 p.m. can be seen. The music comes to an end and another member of the church preaches to the congregation. His sermon is punctuated with more music and two congregants run around the church. He returns to the pulpit and returns to his sermon. He calls on Brother Darryl to testify. This testimony is followed by Carl Porter who invites Diane Tucker to the front to sing a final song before the church closes for the wedding. Brother Brice Anderson officiates the wedding. After the ceremony ends, Carl Porter speaks a prayer and the video ends.</abstract>
