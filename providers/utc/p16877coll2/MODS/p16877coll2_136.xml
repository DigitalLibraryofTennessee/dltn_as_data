  </titleInfo>
  <abstract>Video recording of a service opening with Billy Lemming playing guitar and singing as members of the congregation variously stand and pray or keep rhythm. One man who kneels before the altar has hands laid upon him by Shade Miller. Following this segment, Shade Miller takes to the pulpit and testifies and prays. Members request prayers of the congregation and after they are finished with their requests, Shade Miller places a prayer cloth on the pulpit. Following this, Billy Lemming testifies before Shade Miller again calls for prayer. Members pray in their pew and at the altar, and afterwards Shade Miller talks about the service, and invites congregants to do what the Lord commands today. He is followed by Delphia Nietzel who sings. Other members of the congregation sing thereafter including several other female members and Billy Lemming. Members dance to the music and hold hands together as several others lay hands on them. Member testimony follows during a lull in the music and when they are finished, Shade Miller preaches before music begins again. Shade Miller handles a serpent. After the snake is returned to the box, Shade Miller and he and another man hug as other members look on and Billy Lemming sings. Shade Miller preaches again after the music comes to an end. His sermon is met with applause by members of the congregation. Bill Lemming follows him and gives testimony. Shade Miller takes the pulpit again and continues his sermon and testimony before members receive an imposition of hands before the altar. Other members testify thereafter and congregants lay hands on one another. Shade Miller closes the service with one final statement, and a request that anyone else say what they want before the turns the floor over to Billy Lemming for a final prayer.</abstract>
