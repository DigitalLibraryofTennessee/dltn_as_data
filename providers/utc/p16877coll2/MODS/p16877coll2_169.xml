    <title>Bruce Helton's congregation service, undated</title>
  </titleInfo>
  <abstract>Video recording of a service opening with a poor quality recording of people conversing. The camera pans wildly around the church before refocusing on the altar, where three men speak together. A cut returns the view to a man with a guitar praying and as the camera pans, the few other members in attendance pray. When the prayer ends, the man plays and sings, though the audio quality is still compromised. While he plays more members show up and one woman comes to the altar with a box in hand. The box contains a synthesizer and he plugs it into the amp before they begin singing and playing again. When their song ends, members come forward to receive an imposition of hands from church elders while they pray. After the laying on of hands, music again fills the church and Bruce Helton speaks to the congregation. When he begins to sing, a member removes a serpent from its enclosure and handles. Several female members of the congregation sing as well. The collection plate is passed during the music. When the songs end, Helton testifies and calls for a prayer. While members pray, the man handling serpents places it back in the box. The film then cuts to a home where two people, one man and one woman play guitar and banjo while they sing. As they play another rman joins them in the room and sings.</abstract>
