  <abstract>This is an interview with Ann Geary and Mary Kay Tolleson. Both women were long time members of the Memphis Catholic Council on Human Relations and among the few white persons who participated in the march. This interview took place in the home of Poppy Karchmer two days after the "mini-riot" that followed the break-up of the march led by Martin Luther King, Jr. on MArch 28, 1968. Geary and Tolleson had been discussing their experiences on that day when Mrs. Karchmer asked if she might record their remarks. Mrs. Karchmer, later a member of the Memphis Search for Meaning Committee, donated this take to the committee's collection. This is the only interview in the collection which pre-dates the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.</abstract>
