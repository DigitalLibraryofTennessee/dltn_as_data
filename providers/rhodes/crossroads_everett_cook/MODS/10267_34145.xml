  <abstract>In this interview, prolific Memphis lawyer and judge Russell B. Sugarmon Jr. describes his political career following his campaign for Memphis Public Works Commission in 1959. Despite its failure, Russell Sugarmon's campaign was the first effort of African American voters to nearly put a representative in office, and served to further unify and strengthen the resolve of groups like the NAACP and SCDC.</abstract>
