  <abstract>Interview with Rick Thomas, a professor of sociology at Southwestern and resident of the VECA neighborhood. He talks about how the ethnic characteristics and age composition of the neighborhood has changed over the years. Thomas also goes into the story of how VECA, Vollintine Evergreen Community Association, came to be and their role in the neighborhood. He attributes the stability of the neighborhood not only to VECA but to the small locally owned shops in the area. This interview was conducted in 1979. ï¿½</abstract>
