  <abstract>This is an interview with Mr. John T. Fisher. Prior to serving as VP of the Regional Medical Center at Memphis, also known as The MED, he spent forty years in the automobile business. Mr Fisher recounts his memories of Memphis during the Sanitation Workers Strike, including his relationships with then Memphis Mayor, Henry Loeb and Memphis clergyman and strike leader, Jim Lawson. He also recounts his leadership in Memphis Cares, a public response to MLK's assassination. In addition, he shares his insights on the progress that the city has made along with his optimism for future change. 2007-08-03</abstract>
