  <abstract>This is an interview with Judy Wimmer, who is currently a photographer. Wimmer gives a unique perspective of Memphis during the 1950s. After moving to the affluent neighborhood of Whitehaven, which was predominantly Jewish, she had difficulties adjusting because of her Catholic faith. During the push for Civil Rights, she was involved in many progressive organizations such as the Panel of American Women with Modeane Thompson, Rearing Children of Goodwill, and Concerned Women of Memphis and Shelby County.</abstract>
