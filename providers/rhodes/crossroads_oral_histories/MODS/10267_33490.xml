  <abstract>This is an interview with Brooks Ramsey, who gained national popularity during the 1960s while serving as the Pastor of First Baptist Church in Albany, Georgia. When some of his ushers prevented three black men from entering his church Ramsey publicly denounced the incident. After this controversial incident Ramsey moved to Memphis where his progressive, ecumenical views once again left him at odds with his congregation. Ramsey currently counsels individuals from his home. Our collection also includes an audio interview with Rev. Ramsey conducted in 1968.</abstract>
