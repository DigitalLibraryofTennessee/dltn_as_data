  <abstract>Bert Wolff was and continues to be involved in many activities in the city of Memphis. A 5th generation Jewish woman with a rich sense of family history, she participated in various interracial organizations to improve the status of African Americans. For example, she was a representative on the Panel of American Women, an organization that traveled to various locations where women from different races and backgrounds would discuss their unique experiences of race and gender. In addition, Wolff was the president of the Memphis City School Board in 1983, an election year. Serving in this position she had the deciding controversial vote to integrate the Raleigh Bartlett schools which were newly annexed into the city of Memphis. After her vote, Wolff was not re-elected to the school board. Nevertheless,Wolff remained very active in the Memphis community and can be considered a pivotal agent of change.</abstract>
