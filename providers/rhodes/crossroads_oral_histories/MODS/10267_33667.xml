  <abstract>This is an interview with Bernie Weinman and Marilyn Weinman, who are husband and wife. In the interview they speak about the experience of growing up in a Jewish community and how this experience affected their views about the Civil rights Movement. Life-long members of the Memphis community, they describe their experiences as parents while balancing religion and politics. As a Memphis judge during this era, Judge Weinman recalls cases occuring during the riots of the '60s. Ms. Weinman also reflects on her service on the Panel of American Women, as well on the school superintendent's board during segregation.</abstract>
