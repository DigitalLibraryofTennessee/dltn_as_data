  <abstract>Darryl McKinny was born in Memphis, TN in 1980. He lived in the Binghamton area until he was eight years old, and then his family moved to Highland Heights. Darryl McKinny strives to help people and the youth of the community, either through the ministry or at the juvenile facility. Darryl is a pastor of evangelism at the Two Cornerstone Church. During the day he is working on getting his masters in ministry. At night he works at Youth Dimensions which is a juvenile facility that handles children from the state. Darryl is on the direct counsel at Youth Dimensions, he interacts with the youth all day long. His job is to monitor their behavior, correct them, redirect them, and make sure they are headed in the best direction. "In turn, I now go back to the neighborhood and tell them, 'Hey, you can do this.'" -Darryl Mckinny</abstract>
