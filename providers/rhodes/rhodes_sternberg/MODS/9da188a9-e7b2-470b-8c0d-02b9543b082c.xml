  <abstract>Editorial on forester W. Z. Hawkins' statement that the real danger to Overton Park is a lack of planned forestry. The article includes a statement in support of constructing I-40 through the park. Article also includes a cartoon of a soldier, labelled "Cambodian Prime Minister Lon Nol," lecturing a woman, labelled "Democracy," who is riddled with bullet holes and tied to a post. The soldier says, "Understand, This Is Temporary... Until You No Longer Stand in the Way of Victory!" The original labels on the figures have been crossed out with red ink and renamed, with the soldier as "Memphis Media" and the woman as "Democracy in Memphis."</abstract>
