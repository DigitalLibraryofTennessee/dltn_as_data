  <abstract>An Open Letter from the Tennessee Voters' Council addressed to citizens of Middle Tennessee. The letter endorses Rep. Ross Bass in his race against Gov. Frank Clement for the United States Senate. Bass is applauded for supporting the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and recent tax cuts, while Clement is cited for his failures as Governor on human rights and economic policy. The letterhead identifies Russell Sugarmon and Willis as leaders of the statewide organization.</abstract>
