  <abstract>A letter from Lucius E. Burch to Paul Tudor Jones. Burch strongly opposed the suggestion that Russell Sugarmon be removed from the subcommittee on libraries of the Memphis Committee on Community Relations because of the fact that Sugarmon had recently been retained by the NAACP as legal counsel. For Burch, Sugarmon's involvement with the NAACP only strengthened his importance to the committee.</abstract>
