<dc:description>Due to a shortage of American fighter planes, American fighter squadrons in France were given the French-built Nieuport 28 fighters beginning in March 1918. Due to a shortage of machine guns, the planes were equipped with only one gun each. While maneuverable and easy to fly, the Nieuport 28s had unreliable engines and were notorious for shedding the fabric on their upper wings in a steep dive. By the summer of 1918, American squadrons had replaced their Nieuport 28s with the SPAD S.XIII.</dc:description>
