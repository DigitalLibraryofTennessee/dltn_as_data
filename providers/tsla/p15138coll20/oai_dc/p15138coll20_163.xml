<dc:description>On August 19 or August 20, George W. Puryear was sent by train with eighteen British and six American POWs from Karlsruhe to Landshut, Germany. The trip took two days. The Americans were imprisoned in Burg Trausnitz (a castle dating to the 13th century). The British were imprisoned in a separate camp in town. On September 14, Puryear was transferred with nine other American officers to the camp in Villingen, arriving there on September 15. He escaped from the Villingen POW camp on the night of October 6 and reached Switzerland on October 11.</dc:description>
