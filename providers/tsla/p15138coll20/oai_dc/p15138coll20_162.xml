<dc:description>Both sides suffered appalling casualties on the Western Front. During the Third Battle of Ypres (1917), about 140,000 British soldiers were killed to gain five miles (or one soldier for every 2.25 inches). During the Battle of Verdun (1916), the French Army suffered 377,000 casualties and the German Army 337,000. On the first day of the Battle of the Somme (1916), the British Army suffered 60,000 casualties (roughly the population of the city of Franklin, Tennessee, in 2010).</dc:description>
