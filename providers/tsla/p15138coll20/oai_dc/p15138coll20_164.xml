<dc:description>After completing pilot training at Issoudun and gunnery school at Cazaux, Puryear served a few months as a ferry pilot before joining the 95th Aero Squadron on July 16, 1918. He was taken prisoner on July 26 and, after spending time in several POW camps, arrived at Villingen, Germany, on September 15. On October 6, a mass escape attempt was made from camp. On October 11, Puryear swam across Rhine River at Waldshut, Germany, to reach Switzerland; he became the first American officer in World War I to successfully escape from a German POW camp.</dc:description>
