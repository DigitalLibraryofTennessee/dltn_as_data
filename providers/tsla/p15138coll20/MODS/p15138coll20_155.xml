  <abstract>"The Airman's Escape" is George W. Puryear's autobiographical account of his capture and escape from a German POW camp during World War I. His account appeared in the April 1919 (p. 452-462) and May 1919 (p. 615-628) issues of Atlantic Monthly magazine. The pages were removed from the magazine and bound together into a booklet. The story is also reprinted (verbatim) as Appendix B in Harold Buckley's book "Squadron 95" (New York: Arno Press, 1972).</abstract>

    <abstract>This collection documents the careers in the United States Army Air Service during and after World War I of two brothers from Gallatin, Tennessee. George Wright Puryear was a fighter pilot with the 95th Aero Squadron, was taken prisoner by the Germans, and subsequently became the first American officer to escape from a German prisoner of war camp. Alfred Isaac Puryear spent the war stationed in Paris, France, as a supply officer with the Army Air Service, and became an airship (dirigible) pilot after the war. This collection provides a fascinating visual record of the early history and aircraft of the Army Air Service, which would become the United States Air Force after World War II.</abstract>
