  <abstract>Jackson began the letter defending himself against Col. John Williams's "false" and "malicious" charge of fraud in the matter of Florida land transactions. Jackson later discussed his role in the Chickasaw treaty of 1818 and the commercial potential of the salt lick contained within the treaty's bounds.</abstract>
  <abstract>The Chickasaw Treaty of 1818, also known as the Jackson Purchase, was the cession of land in west Tennessee and Kentucky by the Chickasaw Nation to the United States. The treaty was ratified on October 19, 1818. Andrew Jackson and Isaac Shelby served as commissioners on behalf of the United States.</abstract>
