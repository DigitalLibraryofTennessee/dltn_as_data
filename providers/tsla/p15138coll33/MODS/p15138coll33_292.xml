  <abstract>This letter is a response from Andrew Jackson to Governor John Sevier challenging him to a duel. According to the letter, Sevier spoke disparagingly of Jackson's wife Rachel, who had married Jackson before she was legally divorced from her first husband. Jackson wrote, . In the town of Knoxville did you take the name of a lady into your polluted lips. and now sir in the Neighborhood of Knoxville you shall atone for it or I will publish you as a coward and a poltroon." This letter is part of a larger exchange between Jackson and Sevier, who wrote his own duel challenge to Jackson and accused him of trying to run away.</abstract>
  <abstract>The bitter feud between John Sevier and Andrew Jackson grew out of a dispute over military appointments both men competed over a position as major general of the Tennessee militia. The relationship between Sevier and Jackson deteriorated after Jackson accused Sevier of land fraud, asserting that Sevier conspired to destroy original records of land ownership, replacing them with forged claims. On October 1, 1803, the two men met on the steps of the Old Knox County Courthouse and traded heated words. Gov. Sevier brandished his sword, dared Jackson to draw arms, then insulted Jackson's wife, Rachel, resulting in a physical confrontation. Jackson lunged at Sevier with his cane, then friends of both parties drew pistols, and shots rang out as a bullet grazed at least one bystander. After allies of both men separated the two, a war of words between the governor and the judge quickly escalated in an exchange of letters. In their correspondence, Jackson requested an 'interview' with Sevier--a commonly understood term for a duel. Dueling, however, was prohibited within the borders of Tennessee, so Sevier offered to meet Jackson at any time and place not within the State of Tennessee. Thereafter the two men argued over the timing and location to settle their dispute. Eventually, Jackson met Sevier near present-day Kingston, Tennessee, where a failed attempt at a duel took place. Loyalists to both men provided conflicting accounts and details surrounding the chaotic events of that day in sworn affidavits signed by witnesses, and in published newspaper accounts of the incident. Ultimately, tempers cooled, but the animosity between Sevier and Jackson remained until Sevier's death in 1815. (Belt, Gordon T., and Traci Nichols-Belt. John Sevier: Tennessee's First Hero.
