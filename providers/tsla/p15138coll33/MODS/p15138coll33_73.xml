  <abstract>Letter from an unidentified "H." to his wife relating the assassination attempt of Richard Lawrence on President Jackson. He states that Lawrence was a "painter by trade and an Englishman by birth." He "believe[s] a special Providence saved the old Hero's life." He describes Jackson's response to the assassination attempt as "gallant"--he was the "coolest man on the ground." He continues with a supposed quote by Jackson once his companions surrounded him, "Stand back gentleman, I shall be stabbed by some unseen hand!" H. tells his wife "it is a great blessing to the country that [Jackson] did not fall."</abstract>
  <abstract>On January 30, 1835, Richard Lawrence, an unemployed house painter, produced two pistols and fired upon Andrew Jackson on the steps of the United States Capitol. Both pistols misfired and an outraged Jackson beat Lawrence with his walking cane. Lawrence was tried for attempted murder and found not guilty by reason of insanity. He was committed to a number of institutions until his death in 1861.</abstract>
