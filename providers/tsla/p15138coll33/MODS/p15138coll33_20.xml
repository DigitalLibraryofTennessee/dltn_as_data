  <abstract>A two page letter dated April 1, 1814, and sent from Fort Williams in Alabama. Coffee described a victorious battle fought against the Creek Indians at the bend of the "Tallepoosey" [Tallapoosa] River. He mentioned taking 700 mounted men and 600 Indians across the river to prevent an escape. Coffee remarked that they "put the whole to death but a few that hid under the banks of the river." He estimated the enemy's losses to be about 850 to 900 dead, and 500 captured. His casualty numbers for "friendly Indians" differed from Jackson's, stating that 26 white men were killed and 106 wounded, while 23 "friendly Indians" were killed and 47 wounded. He hoped to see an end to the Creek War within 10 days' time. A postscript related the news of Major Lemuel Montgomery's death in the battle.</abstract>
  <abstract>The Battle of Horseshoe Bend was fought on March 27, 1814, between the war faction (Red Stick) Creek and a coalition of American and Native American troops. The decisive battle proved to be the climax of the Creek War, a conflict between warring factions of Creek and their allies as a part of the War of 1812. Major General Andrew Jackson led a force of just over 2,700 soldiers composed of US Regulars, Tennessee militia and volunteers, as well as 500 Cherokee and 100 allied Creek warriors to a Red Stick fortification at a bend on the Tallapoosa River in present-day Alabama. Jackson estimated that the defending Red Sticks numbered about a thousand. Jackson sent General John Coffee, the cavalry, and almost all of their Indian allies to encircle the encampment and prevent any escape. A two hour artillery barrage preceded a covert attack on the fortification led by Captain Russell, Colonel Richard Brown [Cherokee], and Colonel Morgan, who was in overall command of the Cherokee. This small force set fire to a few of the buildings in an attempt to force the Red Sticks out. The 39th US Infantry, raised almost exclusively in Tennessee and led by Colonel John Williams and Major Lemuel Montgomery, mounted a simultaneous frontal assault of the fortification. Third lieutenant Sam Houston participated in this assault and was wounded, while Montgomery was killed. In his official report, Jackson recorded, "The enemy, altho[ugh] many of them fought to the last with that kind of bravery which desperation inspires, were at length entirely routed and cut to pieces." Many escaping Red Sticks were killed by Coffee's troops. Jackson estimated 800 enemy were killed, including their prophet, Monahee, who was shot in the mouth. Jackson commented, "as if heaven designed to chastise his impostures by an appropriate punishment." He reported that 26 white men were killed along with 18 Cherokee, with 107 and 36 wounded, respectively.</abstract>
