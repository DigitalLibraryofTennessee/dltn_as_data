  <abstract>Andrew Jackson's orders of March 5, 1815, clarifying his orders of February 28, 1815. Jackson had ordered all French subjects to "repair" to central Louisiana to prevent them from aiding the British. This was apparently misconstrued and applied to the Louisiana militia that fought alongside Jackson in the Battle of New Orleans. While praising the "French inhabitants of Louisiana" who had "distinguished [themselves] as brave soldiers," Jackson also suggested that traitorous elements had misconstrued his earlier directive and ordered his officers to report all mutinous actions. A French translation was printed alongside the English.</abstract>
  <abstract>Following his success in the Creek Wars, Major General Andrew Jackson was appointed commander of the seventh military district, replacing General Thomas Flournoy. This military district contained Tennessee, Louisiana, and the Mississippi Territory. These military districts were abolished on May 17, 1815, after the conclusion of the War of 1812.</abstract>
