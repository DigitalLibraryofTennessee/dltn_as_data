  <abstract>Muster roll of friendly Creek troops raised during the First Seminole War. It listed the names, ranks, expiration of service, and remarks for the 68 Creek warriors under the command of Captain Powas Hanjo. The remarks sections indicated that Jackson had allowed four days for them to return home. They were being mustered out for discharge according to Major George Cutler. Since the 1818 Florida incursion was a US regular army operation, these native allies were likely being paid by the Federal government. Jackson as a military commander used Native American allies in nearly all of his military operations.</abstract>
