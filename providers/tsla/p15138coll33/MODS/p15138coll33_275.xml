  <abstract>Broadside from the Examiner published in Nashville, November 2, 1814, with a plea for volunteers from Major General William Carroll. Carroll, as commander of the Tennessee militia, had been tasked by the US military departmental commander, Andrew Jackson, with raising 5000 militia to defend New Orleans from British attack. Addressed to "Brave Tennesseans," the broadside exhorts citizens to abandon the "dull pursuits of private life" and repel the "hosts of Britain" threatening to invade the Gulf Coast and take New Orleans. The appeal to a specifically American, anti-British patriotism as well as the manifest interest in securing New Orleans and the Mississippi River--an ever-present concern of early Tennesseans--is prominent in this document.</abstract>
  <abstract>Upon Andrew Jackson's appointment as Major General in the US Army, Carroll replaced him as Major General of the Tennessee militia. After the Creek War, Carroll returned to Nashville to raise a militia to defend New Orleans from British attack. During the Battle of New Orleans, his Tennessee volunteers defended the center, where the primary British attack was focused. After the victory, Carroll became a Tennessee hero, second in stature only to Jackson. He served six terms as governor of Tennessee from 1821 until 1835, except for the two years that Sam Houston and William Hall held the office from 1827 to 1829.</abstract>
