  <abstract>This political cartoon is a sepia print of a winged demon with the head of Andrew Jackson, hovering in the sky holding strings connected to symbols and objects representing political offices. This cartoon depicts the "spoils system" of rewarding the political loyalists with offices and thereby changing government appointees with each election. Clearly expressive of anti-Jackson sentiments, the cartoon shows among other images a withered witch holding a Roman lictor and a tree with two hanged militiamen, an allusion to Jackson's summary execution of men during the Creek War.</abstract>
  <abstract>During Jackson's presidential administration, he replaced many Republican officeholders with loyal Democrats that supported him. Jackson believed that instead of civil servants having lifetime jobs people needed to be rotated into office and give more people a chance to serve their government. Jackson's opponents called the practice of rewarding political supporters with government jobs the spoils system.</abstract>
