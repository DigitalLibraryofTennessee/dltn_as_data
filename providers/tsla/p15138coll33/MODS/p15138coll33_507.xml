  <abstract>A newspaper article that provides a report of the Chickasaw treaty from a Nashville newspaper in the time period that the event occurred.</abstract>
  <abstract>The Jackson Purchase included the area of West Tennessee and southwestern Kentucky between the Tennessee and Mississippi Rivers. This area had historically belonged to the Chickasaws but was ceded in the Treaty of Tecumseh. The treaty with the Chickasaws was negotiated by Andrew Jackson and Issac Shelby in 1818. The treaty signed in October of 1818 required the national government to pay $300,000 to the Chickasaws for their land claims. Over time, white settlers and speculators came into the West Tennessee area and by 1819 Hardin and Shelby counties were formed.</abstract>
