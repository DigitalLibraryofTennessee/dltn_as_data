  <abstract>This night battle of December 23 served as a precursor to the greater battle on January 8. On the morning of the 23rd, British General John Keane and 1,800 regulars landed south of New Orleans. Andrew Jackson led a detachment of over 2,000 men, including Major Jean Dacquin's battalion of free blacks and eighteen Choctaw led by Captain Pierre Jugeant, to meet them seven miles south of the city. He surprised them in the night and the almost two-and-a-half hour battle delayed further British advance until January. This allowed the Americans to construct earthworks to protect their artillery, until the main attack occurred on January 8, 1815.</abstract>
