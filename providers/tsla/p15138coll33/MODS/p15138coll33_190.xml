  <abstract>Lewis wrote Coffee because he had not heard from him since leaving the Chickasaw treaty ground in northern Mississippi territory. He requested an update on treaty negotiations with the Chickasaw from either Coffee or Thomas Hinds. In regard to the treaty negotiations, Lewis remarked that the "government is so liberally disposed towards its red children." He estimated that the Federal government would grant the Chickasaw $20,000 in annuities and an additional sum to the chiefs; it would also build schools for the Chickasaw. The latter measure was seen as one of the chief means of assimilating or Americanizing native Americans. He told Coffee that his health was recovered, and hoped that Coffee's family was well. Lewis remarked that Coffee should get the "political news" from General Jackson.</abstract>
  <abstract>In 1826, Secretary of War James Barbour appointed John Coffee, William Clark, and Thomas Hinds as commissioners to treat with the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations. Their orders included the complete cession of their lands east of the Mississippi River. They ultimately failed to convince the nations to acquiesce to their demand in 1826. However, in 1830 and 1832 the Choctaw and Chickasaw, respectively, signed the Treaty of Pontotoc ceding the remainder of their eastern tribal lands to the United States.</abstract>
