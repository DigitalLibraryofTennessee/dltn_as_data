<dc:title>Letter from Thomas Hinds to John Coffee, September 3, 1826</dc:title>
<dc:description>A two page letter from Mississippian Thomas Hinds to John Coffee regarding treaty negotiations with the Choctaw and Chickasaw. Hinds reported that no negotiations had taken place thus far, but that the two treaties should be held at around the same time. He concluded his letter by suggesting that Jackson might talk with them as the two nations held a "high estimation" of him.</dc:description>
<dc:description>In 1826, Secretary of War James Barbour appointed John Coffee, William Clark, and Thomas Hinds as commissioners to treat with the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations. Their orders included the complete cession of their lands east of the Mississippi River. They ultimately failed to convince the nations to acquiesce to their demand in 1826. However, in 1830 and 1832 the Choctaw and Chickasaw, respectively, signed the Treaty of Pontotoc ceding the remainder of their eastern tribal lands to the United States.</dc:description>
