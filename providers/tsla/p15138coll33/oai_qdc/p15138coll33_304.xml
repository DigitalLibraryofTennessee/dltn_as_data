<dc:title>Letter from Aaron Burr to Andrew Jackson</dc:title>
<dc:description>Undated letter from Aaron Burr to Andrew Jackson at the Hermitage in Nashville, asking Jackson to take charge of his carriages, horses, and driver during his absence on a trip south to New Orleans.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This letter, while undated, appears to be after Burr's travels in the Ohio Valley but prior to his journey to the Louisiana territory. Burr stayed at the Hermitage as a guest of Jackson's in 1805 before meeting his co-conspirator General James Wilkinson at Fort Massac and continuing on to New Orleans, which he referenced in the letter. Later in 1805, Wilkinson accused Burr of treason for conspiring with the Spanish to carve out an independent nation from the American West. The former vice-president was arrested in 1806 in Mississippi Territory by Edmund Pendleton Gaines. Burr was later tried and found not guilty. Jackson testified at his trial.</dc:description>
