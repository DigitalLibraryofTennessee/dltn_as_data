<dc:description>James Winchester was born in Westminster, Maryland in 1752. During the American Revolution, Winchester served in the Maryland regiments. Winchester came to Davidson County in 1785. When the state of Tennessee was organized in 1796, Winchester was elected Speaker of the Senate and brigadier general of the Mero District. Winchester was, like Andrew Jackson, a general officer from Tennessee in the War of 1812 (after having been twice captured during the Revolutionary War). His military reputation suffered after an 1813 defeat and ensuing massacre at the River Raisin in Michigan; Jackson restored him to command at Mobile just before the British invasion of the Gulflands.  After 1815, Winchester organized a steamboat company, bought and sold land, and&#160;surveyed the boundary line between Tennessee and the Chickasaw Nation. After the Jackson Purchase in 1818, Winchester, John Overton and Andrew Jackson established the town of Memphis in the western corner of Tennessee near the Mississippi River.</dc:description>
