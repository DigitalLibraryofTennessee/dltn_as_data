<dc:title>Thomas Johnson to Andrew Jackson, June 8, 1812</dc:title>
<dc:description>Letter from militia commander Thomas Johnson to Andrew Jackson updating him on the situation of the Crawley and Manley family murders. Johnson stated that the murders happened on May 12, and that he and 40 men looked for the "Indians who committed the murder," but "made no discoveries." The hostile warriors and their female captive had fled south to cross the Tennessee River into Creek territory. Jackson then apparently forward this report to Major [William] Bradford.</dc:description>
<dc:description>In May 1812, Red Stick warriors, possibly adherents of the Shawnee warrior Tecumseh and his brother The Prophet who urged a pan-Indian confederacy to roll back white settlement, attacked the isolated cabins of the Manley and Crawley families on Duck River in Humphreys County. The inhabitants were slain with the exception of Martha Crawley, who was taken captive. Ultimately, Martha Crawley escaped by hiding in a log and returned to Tennessee, but Tennesseans demanded justice for the attack. Friendly Creeks arrested the perpetrators and executed the guilty warriors. The executions led to a civil war amongst the Creeks.</dc:description>
