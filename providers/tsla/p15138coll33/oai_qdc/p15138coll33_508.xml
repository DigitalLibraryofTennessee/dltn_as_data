<dc:title>Andrew Jackson Portrait</dc:title>
<dc:description>A portrait of Andrew Jackson in military uniform.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Andrew Jackson was born on March 15, 1767. During his lifetime he served as a lawyer, a judge, a congressman, a senator, a military general and as President of the United States. In 1818, the federal government appointed Andrew Jackson and former Kentucky governor Isaac Shelby to negotiate with the Chickasaws for land between the Tennessee River and Missisissippi River. Jackson and Shelby convinced the Chickasaw leaders to give up their tribe's claims to the vast West Tennessee region, as well as parts of western Kentucky. The treaty signed in October of 1818 required the national government to pay $300,000 to the Chickasaws for their land claims.</dc:description>
