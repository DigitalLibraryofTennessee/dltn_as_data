<dc:title>Letter from William B. Lewis to John Coffee, July 27, 1828</dc:title>
<dc:description>Lewis wrote Coffee to report that "The floodgates of falsehood, slander, and abuse [had] been hoisted, and the most nauseating filth is poured, in torrents, on the head of  . General Jackson." He accused Adams's and Clay's supporters of losing "all sense of decency." Lewis informed Coffee that Jackson's enemies accused him of being a "negroe [sic] trader" in regard to a contested slave transaction between Jackson, John Hutchings, and "old Rawlings." Lewis defended Jackson's role in the transaction, saying that he "had nothing to do with it." Lewis also reported that some of Governor Isaac Shelby's family "charged the general with having acted corruptly at the Chickasaw Treaty of 1818, relative to the purchase of the Colbert Reservations." Lewis asked Coffee if Jimmy [James] Jackson had any hand in that accusation and the details of the treaty.</dc:description>
