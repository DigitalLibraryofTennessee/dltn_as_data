<dc:title>Letter from John Sevier to Andrew Jackson, October 10, 1803</dc:title>
<dc:description>Regarding their prospective duel, Gov. Sevier responded to Jackson's letter from earlier in the day, October 10. He began by saying, "I am again perplexed with your scurilous [sic] and poltroon language." He chastised Jackson for requesting a meeting within the state, knowing full well that as governor he cannot violate state law by doing so. He stated that Jackson's "conduct during the whole of [his] pretended bravery, shows [him] to be a pitiful poltroon and coward." Basically accusing Jackson of evading a fight and posturing, Sevier closes by saying: "I shall not receive another letter from you, as I deem you a coward." It appears that Sevier wrote and explanation of the events on the reverse, as it does not appear connected with the correspondence.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The bitter feud between John Sevier and Andrew Jackson grew out of a dispute over military appointments with both men competing over a position as major general of the Tennessee militia. The relationship between Sevier and Jackson deteriorated after Jackson accused Sevier of land fraud, asserting that Sevier conspired to destroy original records of land ownership and replace them with forged claims. On October 1, 1803, the two men met on the steps of the Old Knox County Courthouse and traded heated words. Gov. Sevier brandished his sword, dared Jackson to draw arms, then insulted Jackson's wife, Rachel, resulting in a physical confrontation. Jackson lunged at Sevier with his cane, then friends of both parties drew pistols, and shots rang out as a bullet grazed at least one bystander. After allies of both men separated the two, a war of words between the governor and the judge quickly escalated in an exchange of letters. In their correspondence, Jackson requested an 'interview' with Sevier--a commonly understood term for a duel. Dueling, however, was prohibited within the borders of Tennessee, so Sevier offered to meet Jackson at any time and place not within the State of Tennessee. Thereafter the two men argued over the timing and location to settle their dispute. Eventually, Jackson met Sevier near present-day Kingston, Tennessee, where a failed attempt at a duel took place. Loyalists on both sides provided conflicting accounts and details surrounding the chaotic events of that day in sworn affidavits signed by witnesses, and in published newspaper accounts of the incident. Ultimately, tempers cooled, but the animosity between Sevier and Jackson remained until Sevier's death in 1815. (Belt, Gordon T., and Traci Nichols-Belt. John Sevier: Tennessee's First Hero.
