<dc:title>Letter from John Coffee to his wife, Mary, January 20, 1815, describing the Battle of New Orleans</dc:title>
<dc:description>Coffee wrote his wife, Mary,  just weeks after the Battle of New Orleans to recount both the night engagement and full battle. He began with a description of the night battle of December 23, 1814.  Coffee led 600 regulars and 200 militia, by moonlight, to engage the British, camped "within six miles of New Orleans." After explaining the course of the battle, he estimates the losses on both sides as 25 killed, 70 wounded, and 75 captured for the Americans, and 400 killed and wounded, with 100 taken prisoner for the British. Though there were only two large scale engagements, the two sides continuously harried each other with bombardments and small arms fire; Coffee remarked that it felt like "one continuous battle for twenty eight days." He went into detail about the January 8 battle [the one referred to as the Battle of New Orleans], telling his wife "they lost in killed wounded and prisoners upwards of three thousand men, their commander in chief, and second in command, both killed, and Major General Kean badly wounded." After the battle the British decamped and left the area on January 18, 1815. Coffee estimates "our whole loss in all this affair has been about fifty killed, one hundred and twenty wounded, and one hundred and ten prisoners, all of which we have since got by exchange." Coffee concludes the letter with personal expressions to his wife and daughter, and an update regarding a Mr. Harris who reached New Orleans from Mobile the day before.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The primary Battle of New Orleans took place on January 8, 1815, the culmination of 17 days of engagement between American and British troops south of New Orleans. Under cover of artillery fire, the British launched a two-pronged attack on the American breastworks at the Rodriquez Canal on the morning of January 8. One, led by Colonel William Thornton on the west bank of the Mississippi River, attempted to distract from the main assault, but a collapsed dam and heavy mud, held it up. The main force, led by Major General Samuel Gibbs, marched toward the center of the fortifications, held by Major General William Carroll, hidden by a dense fog. As they neared the defenses, the fog lifted exposing them to heavy artillery fire, which, along with forgetting to bring the ladders and fascines to cross the canal, decimated the British advance. Major General John Keane led a small detachment to assist the assault but was wounded while crossing the battlefield. Colonel Rennie and most other senior officers, as well as a large number of their troops, were killed in the initial attack. Major General Edward Pakenham, the commander of the entire British force, led a second wave, which collapsed when both Pakenham and Gibbs received fatal wounds by grapeshot. Major Wilkinson led a third and final assault on the breastworks, but was wounded when he made it to the American line. The remainder of the British force, primarily reserves commanded by Major General John Lambert, retreated toward camp. Thornton's delayed attack on the west bank was initially successful, but the lack of support left these achievements unrealized. Adjutant General Robert Butler reported to Jackson that the British sustained 700 killed, 1400 wounded, and 500 taken prisoner; however, the United States Army Center for Military History today states 285 killed, 1,265 wounded, and 484 captured or missing. The American suffered only 13 dead, 30 wounded, and 19 captured or missing. This one-sided victory cemented Andrew Jackson's reputation as a war hero and thrust him into the national spotlight.</dc:description>
