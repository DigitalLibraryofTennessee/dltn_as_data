<dc:title>The modern Balaam and his ass</dc:title>
<dc:description>This political cartoon, a hostile allegory of Jackson's quixotic and failed Specie Circular, depicts President Jackson as the Old Testament figure Balaam (Numbers: 22), cane in hand, riding his ass who is carrying a saddlebag of "specie currency circulating medium." The angel of the story is shown holding a flaming sword with the inscription "Protest, $200,000." Martin van Buren follows Jackson while saying "I shall tread in the footsteps of my illustrious predecessor!" The text balloons in the cartoon are accurate renderings of the scriptural dialogue amongst the angel, Balaam and his talking ass.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The story of Balaam and his donkey is a biblical reference from Numbers: 22. Balaam was a sorcerer who, promised with riches, was asked by King Balak of the Moabites to curse the fleeing Israelites. His donkey, which could see the angel of God blocking his path with a sword, tried three times to prevent Balaam from proceeding and was beaten for its actions. God spoke angrily to Balaam through the donkey and opened his eyes to see the angel present. Balaam then blessed the Israelites rather than cursed them.</dc:description>
