<dc:title>Letter from John Overton to Ralph Earl, September 1, 1829, reminiscing on the character of the late Rachel Jackson</dc:title>
<dc:description>About a year after Rachel Jackson's death, Overton wrote to Ralph Earl a fond reminiscence of his good friend's wife. Overton, who had boarded with the Donelson family in the 1790s, praised her as "amiable" and "ever-to-be-lamented," seeking to vindicate her from the "unjust aspersions unwantonly introduced in the presidential canvas.  He mentioned knowing her in her younger years, full of "naivette [sic], simplicity, and innocence." He praised her character later in life as well and stated she was "serene and happy" with Jackson until rival newspapers began publishing scurrilous attacks because of the questionable circumstances of her youthful elopement with Jackson. The letter was kept in a scrapbook by Andrew Jackson.</dc:description>
<dc:description>John Overton was perhaps Jackson's closest advisor and confidante. Jackson often wrote to Overton, discussing Washington politics, local and national affairs, gossip, and land speculation. Overton served as federal tax collector on the whiskey tax from 1796 until 1803 and was elected to replace Jackson as judge of the Superior Court of Law and Equity, where he served until 1810. He and Jackson were partners in land speculation and co-founded the city of Memphis. Overton lived at his plantation near Nashville, Traveller's Rest.</dc:description>
