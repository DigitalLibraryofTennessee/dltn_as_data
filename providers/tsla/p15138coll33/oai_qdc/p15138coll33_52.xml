<dc:title>Letter from James Barbour to John Coffee, May 24, 1826</dc:title>
<dc:description>Letter from James Barbour, Secretary of War, to John Coffee, William Clark, and Thomas Hinds appointing them commissioners to treat with the Choctaw and Chickasaw in order to extinguish their lands within Mississippi. Barbour offered them $20,000 for expenses and expected them to conclude negotiations by October 1, 1826. Barbour authorized them to trade land, "acre for acre" for land in Missouri and Arkansas</dc:description>
<dc:description>In 1826, Secretary of War James Barbour appointed John Coffee, William Clark, and Thomas Hinds as commissioners to treat with the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations. Their orders included the complete cession of their lands east of the Mississippi River. They ultimately failed to convince the nations to acquiesce to their demand in 1826. However, in 1830 and 1832 the Choctaw and Chickasaw, respectively, signed the Treaty of Pontotoc ceding the remainder of their eastern tribal lands to the United States.</dc:description>
