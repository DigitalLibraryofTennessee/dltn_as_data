<dc:title>Inaugural address, delivered by General Andrew Jackson on the fourth of March, 1829</dc:title>
<dc:description>A published version of Andrew Jackson's first inaugural address. In his speech, Jackson outlined his vision for the country. He led off by addressing the crowd as "fellow citizens," confirming his image as man of the people. He remarked that he would respect the limitations of the executive branch as well as the rights of the states. He championed internal improvement, proper management of the revenue, and "a just and liberal policy" toward Native Americans. He opposed enlarging the army but favored an increase of the navy. An artistic border surrounds the text.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The election of 1828 was one of the most contentious and hard-fought of the 19th century. Many published attacks on Jackson's character and supposed misdeeds circulated throughout the country. Jackson's supporters denounced John Quincy Adams for having promised the Secretary of State position to Henry Clay in return for his support in the 1824 election. Jackson prevailed, winning 56% of the popular vote.</dc:description>
