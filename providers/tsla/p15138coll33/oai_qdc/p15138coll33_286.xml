<dc:title>Alfred Jackson sitting in his cabin at The Hermitage property</dc:title>
<dc:description>Alfred Jackson, formerly  enslaved by Jackson, sitting in a rocking chair in his red cedar log cabin (built 1841) at The Hermitage. A quilt is visible on the large four poster bed, which may have come from the mansion.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Alfred's mother Betty (1793-1870) was enslaved as the Jacksons' cook; his uncle George was Jackson's personal servant and later the family carriage driver. Alfred assisted with the horses, maintained the wagons and farm equipment, and after emancipation was a tenant farmer at The Hermitage. He lived at the Hermitage longer than anyone white or black, serving as a handyman and tour guide for the Ladies Hermitage Association after the house became a museum. He lived at The Hermitage until his death and is buried near Andrew and Rachel Jackson in the garden.</dc:description>
