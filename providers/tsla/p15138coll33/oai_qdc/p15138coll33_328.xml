<dc:title>Letter from Jackson to Col. William Moore, November 15, 1833, regarding Lincoya</dc:title>
<dc:description>In this single page letter to Colonel William Moore, Jackson briefly recounts the discovery of Lyncoya, following the Battle of Tallushatchee [Jackson writes Tallahassee], "suckling his dead mother's breast." He mentions the Creek child being sent to him by General Coffee. Jackson then refers to another "wounded" Creek child whom Moore had "brought into camp" to be treated and later raised by Doctor [John] Shelby. This latter child, according to Jackson, "turned out badly" and "ran away from the Doctor."</dc:description>
<dc:description>Lincoyer[also written Lyncoya, or Lincoya], a Creek child, was found on the battlefield at Tallushatchee, lying next to his slain mother. Jackson took in the child and raised him alongside his own adopted son Andrew Jackson Jr. Lincoyer died of tuberculosis in 1828</dc:description>
