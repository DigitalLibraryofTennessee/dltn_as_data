<dc:description>John Coffee was one of Andrew Jackson's closest friends. He served under him as general in the War of 1812, both during the Creek campaigns and at the Battle of New Orleans. They were associates in business and land ventures. Coffee, a large man, backed up Jackson in a number of his physical affrays. Coffee also served as surveyor-general for the Mississippi Territory, later Alabama, from 1817 until his death in 1833.</dc:description>
