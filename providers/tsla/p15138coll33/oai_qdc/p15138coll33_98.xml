<dc:title>Letter from Andrew Jackson to unknown, February 6, 1843 (not in his hand) </dc:title>
<dc:description>Letter signed by Andrew Jackson that explained the circumstances around the fine imposed by Judge Dominic Hall after the Battle of New Orleans. Jackson, intent on correcting the "falsehoods" published by a Mr. Botts in the Globe, repudiated the claim that the ladies of New Orleans paid his fine. Jackson stated, "The fine was paid by myself the moment the decision was announced, by a check given by A. L. Duncan and taken up by me, to prevent a vindictive judge from issuing a ca. sa." In defending his actions, Jackson called into question Mr. Bott's character and expounded on the legal circumstances that surrounded New Orleans during and after the British attack in 1814 and 1815. </dc:description>
<dc:description>During the British invasion of Louisiana, Major General Andrew Jackson imposed martial law. Following the Battle of New Orleans and news of the Treaty of Ghent, Judge Dominic Hall challenged Jackson's continuance of military rule. Jackson proceeded to throw Judge Hall in jail for disobedience. Once martial law was finally ended, Hall imposed a $1,000 fine on Jackson for contempt, which Jackson promptly paid. Later in life, Jackson lobbied Congress that he be repaid, which he finally was in 1844.</dc:description>
