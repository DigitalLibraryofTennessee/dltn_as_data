  <abstract>A young girl learns the basics of a healthy breakfast with the help of a teacher. The blackboard reads, "Menu for breakfast, Oatmeal and cream, Egg on toast, Milk, Baked apple." The student is wearing a dress with no shoes.</abstract>
  <abstract>Dr. Harry Mustard worked in Rutherford County, Tennessee, during the 1920's on behalf of the Rockefeller Foundation's Commonwealth Fund. He took photographs as part of a five-year study of health and sanitation conditions of rural children. Dr. Mustard went on to become a very prominent public health administrator. Mustard and his staff determined that successful public health initiatives began at the grassroots level and usually involved women and children.</abstract>
