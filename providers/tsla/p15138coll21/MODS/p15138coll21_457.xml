    <abstract>The Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project produced more than 500 hours of audio tape, 9600 slides, and 2200 black and white negatives, including duplicates of scores of historic photographs which had been cached for years by their owners. Several years ago, TSLA initiated a project to digitize selections of the audio recordings and photographs from the collection in order to improve public access. The recordings, held originally on reel-to-reel and cassettes, and the accompanying photographs, include material on traditional quilting, burial customs, storytelling, blacksmithing, herbal medicine, fishing, logging, farming techniques, and music. Nationally recognized ballad singers Dee and Delta Hicks and Joe, Ethel, and Creed Birchfield (founding members of the Roan Mountain Hilltoppers) are just a few of the musical artists featured in the collection. To date, the bulk of the collection remains unprocessed and in the original formats. Approximately twenty percent of the audio recordings have been digitized. The recordings and images found in this TeVA collection represent just a sample of the rich material yet to be discovered. The digitization project is ongoing, and we will add items as they become available.</abstract>
