<dc:title>Linnie Johnson and Jesse Robinson Part 3</dc:title>
<dc:description>Audio files of White County neighbors Linnie Johnson and Jesse Robinson, both born in Dekalb County, recorded as part of the Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project.  Johnson performs unaccompanied ballads and old time music, and there are discussions concerning the backgrounds of the songs.  Together, they relay tales of ghosts, haints, hangings, and murders.  Anecdotes concerning the Ku Klux Klan and Night Riders are included.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The contributions of Johnson and Robinson convey both musical and social history of the Upper Cumberland area.  The Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project began in 1979 under the direction of Park Ranger Bobby Fulcher and continued until 1983.  Each summer during those years, three folklorists were stationed in Tennessee's state parks.  From those bases, they conducted interviews, took photographs, and recorded music with local tradition-bearers.</dc:description>
