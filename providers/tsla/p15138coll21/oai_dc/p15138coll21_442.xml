<dc:title>Claude Chessor</dc:title>
<dc:description>Audio files of Dickson County resident Claude Chessor, born in Hickman County, recorded as part of the Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project.  Chessor discusses dulcimer making, dulcimer design, and dulcimer playing.  He performs examples of ballads, old time music, country music and religious music on different types of dulcimers.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Chessor's contribution illustrates the expert craftsmanship required to design and handmake cypress-top, spruce-top, and cherry dulcimers.  He also provides the listener with variety of sound, as he plays music on these different kinds of heritage instruments.  The Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project began in 1979 under the direction of Park Ranger Bobby Fulcher and continued until 1983.  From bases in state parks, folklorists conducted interviews, took photos, and recorded music.</dc:description>
