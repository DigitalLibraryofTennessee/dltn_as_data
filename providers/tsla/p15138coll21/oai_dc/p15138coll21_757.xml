<dc:title>Young family with rope</dc:title>
<dc:description>Historic outdoor photograph of a young family posing with a big wooden spool of heavy rope that would have been used in logging, mining, or railroad work. Presumably, these are members of the Linder family in the forest of the Big South Fork area most likely a mother and her three young children. The company involved would then, probably be Stearns Coal and Lumber Company.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Linder's contribution illustrates the impact commercial lumber and coal ventures of northern investors had on areas like Scott, Pickett, and Fentress Counties.  The Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project began in 1979 under the direction of Park Ranger Bobby Fulcher and continued until 1983.  Each summer during those years, three folklorists were stationed in Tennessee's state parks.  From those bases, they conducted interviews, took photographs, and recorded music with local tradition-bearers.</dc:description>
