<dc:title>Jewel Allen Part 1</dc:title>
<dc:description>Audio files of Fayette County resident Jewel Allen recorded as part of the Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project.  Allen conveys family history, humorous tales and jokes, as well as an anecdote dealing with slavery.  Allen related his methods for bottoming chairs with corn shucks and piecing quilts.  Allen was born in Hardeman County.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Allen's contribution highlights the transmittal of skills such as chair caning and quilting through African American family networks and how these skills served as financial safety nets in hard times.  The Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project began in 1979 under the direction of Park Ranger Bobby Fulcher and continued until 1983.  From bases at state parks, folklorists conducted summer interviews, took photographs, and recorded music with local tradition-bearers.</dc:description>
