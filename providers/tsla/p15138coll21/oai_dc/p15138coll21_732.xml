<dc:title>Workyard tools</dc:title>
<dc:description>Images of chair caning supplies, tools, and the workyard used by Emanuel Dupree. Dupree, a third generation white oak basket maker and chair bottomer or caner, describes in his contributions to the Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project the processes and how he learned. This African American woodcrafter also relates performing in local fife and drum bands and the accompanying celebrations.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Dupree's contribution beautifully illustrates the transmittal of folk art skills through African American family networks. Dupree has been called one of the leading 20th century makers of split baskets.  His Fayette County fife and drum band gained national attention and joined the list of surviving black fife and drum bands in Mississippi and Georgia. This tradition, arising in the South after the Civil War, and loosely based on militia bands, centered around performances at summer holiday picnics.</dc:description>
