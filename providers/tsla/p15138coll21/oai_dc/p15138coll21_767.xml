<dc:title>Wooden sculpture</dc:title>
<dc:description>Dancing man carved from sassafras wood by Willard Walton. Walton, a folk artist, performer, and sassafras seller, uses his woodworking and whittling skills to create animals from tree stumps and tree roots.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Walton's contribution highlights a multi-medium folk artist inspired by his family history, his natural surroundings, his life experiences, and his military service in India.  His woodcraft gained national prominence, and advertisements for his walking sticks appeared in New York Magazine as early as the 1970s. The Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project began in 1979 under the direction of Park Ranger Bobby Fulcher and continued until 1983.</dc:description>
