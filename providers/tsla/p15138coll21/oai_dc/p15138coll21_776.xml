<dc:description>Dick Huddleston, long-time Wilson County resident and Cedars of Lebanon park employee, wearing a black hat, white shirt, and striped blue trousers. Huddleston's contribution to the Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project furnishes, not only family history, but Wilson County business, agricultural, and architectural history, and history of the Cedars of Lebanon State Park.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project began in 1979 under the direction of Park Ranger Bobby Fulcher and continued until 1983.  Each summer during those years, three folklorists were stationed in Tennessee's state parks.  From those bases, they conducted interviews, took photographs, and recorded music with local tradition-bearers.</dc:description>
