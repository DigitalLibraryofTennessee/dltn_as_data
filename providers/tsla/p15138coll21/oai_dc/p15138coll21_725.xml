<dc:description>Images of Fentress County resident Porter Linder pictured with his dog and at various locations on his Sharp Place Community property.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Linder's contribution illustrates the impact commercial lumber and coal ventures of northern investors had on areas like Scott, Pickett, and Fentress Counties.  The Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project began in 1979 under the direction of Park Ranger Bobby Fulcher and continued until 1983.  Each summer during those years, three folklorists were stationed in Tennessee's state parks.  From those bases, they conducted interviews, took photographs, and recorded music with local tradition-bearers</dc:description>
