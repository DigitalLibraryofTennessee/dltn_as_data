<dc:title>Making Lye Soap Set</dc:title>
<dc:description>Soapmakers from Whiteville are pictured demonstrating the making of lye soap in front of Chickasaw State Park program spectators. Maxine Wachstein can be seen stirring the soap mixture and preparing to pour the soap into milk cartons to harden.  June Crowder and Marie Bryant also participated in the demonstration.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project began in 1979 under the direction of Park Ranger Bobby Fulcher and continued until 1983.  Each summer during those years, three folklorists were stationed in Tennessee's state parks.  From those bases, they conducted interviews, took photographs, and recorded music with local tradition-bearers.</dc:description>
