<dc:title>Johnson Swafford Part 2</dc:title>
<dc:description>Bledsoe County resident Johnson Swafford describes homemade instruments such as hide and cheese box banjos, gourd fiddles, and the mouth bow.  Swafford makes banjos, fiddles, dulcimers, and mandolins, and he relates his processes. Swafford remembers shape-note singing schools in the area, where songs were sung a cappella, and the schools would end with a revival.  He talks of candy pulls, ice cream socials, buck dancing, square dancing, and logging activities that fostered community spirit.</dc:description>
<dc:description>"Old-Time" Baptists brought traditions of lined a cappella singing with them into northeastern Tennessee.  Eighteenth century northern ministers with their "Singing School Movement of New England" spawned the shape-note type singing that appeared in Tennessee. This combination of text, the use of shapes for musical notation, and the voicing of a song's notation prior to singing it was promoted by the increased availability of four-shape-note songbooks.</dc:description>
