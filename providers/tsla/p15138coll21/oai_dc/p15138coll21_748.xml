<dc:title>Dulcimer</dc:title>
<dc:description>Front of dulcimers pictured as a group. These cypress-top, spruce-top, and cherry dulcimers were crafted by Dickson County resident Claude Chessor. Chessor was born in Hickman County,</dc:description>
<dc:description>Chessor's contribution illustrates the expert craftsmanship required to design and handmake dulcimers and provides a body of materials dealing with dulcimer making, dulcimer design, and dulcimer playing. The Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project began in 1979 under the direction of Park Ranger Bobby Fulcher and continued until 1983.  Each summer folklorists stationed in Tennessee's state parks conducted interviews, took photographs, and recorded music with local tradition-bearers.</dc:description>
