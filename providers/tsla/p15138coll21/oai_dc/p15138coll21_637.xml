<dc:title>Andrew Jones Part 1</dc:title>
<dc:description>Audio files of Lake County resident Andrew Jones recorded as part of the Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project.  Jones relates family history, personal philosophy, and tales of medicine shows.  He performs blues selections accompanying himself on the guitar; he "makes strings talk."   Jones provides, as well, examples of African American toasts.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Jones's contribution brings to light the African American verbal art tradition of the toast.  These long verses or recitations can be traced back to the time of Reconstruction, and they flourished in both rural and urban settings.  Toasts can also be referred to as "brags," and these largely male, heroic expressions can be laced with street slang, obscenities, and misogynistic views.</dc:description>
