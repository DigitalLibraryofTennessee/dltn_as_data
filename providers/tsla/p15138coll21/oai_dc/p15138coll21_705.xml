<dc:title>Emanuel (Manny) Dupree making baskets</dc:title>
<dc:description>Fayette County resident Emanuel Dupree is seated amidst his basket making supplies, holding rolled up white oak splits, and working on a split white oak basket at his home five miles south of Somerville, Tennessee.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Emanuel Dupree's contribution beautifully illustrates the transmittal of folk art skills through African American family networks. Dupree has been called one of the leading 20th century makers of split baskets. His Fayette County fife and drum band gained national attention and joined the list of surviving black fife and drum bands in Mississippi and Georgia. This tradition, arising in the South after the Civil War, and loosely based on militia bands, centered around performances at summer holiday picnics.</dc:description>
