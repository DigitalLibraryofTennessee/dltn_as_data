<dc:title>Jewel Allen's home in Whiteville</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pictured is the home of basket maker Jewel Allen in Whiteville.  The garden shown in the image is that of Gus Hicks.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Allen's contribution highlights the transmittal of skills such as chair caning and quilting through African American family networks and how these skills served as financial safety nets in hard times.  The Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project began in 1979 under the direction of Park Ranger Bobby Fulcher and continued until 1983.  From bases at state parks, folklorists conducted summer interviews, took photographs, and recorded music with local tradition-bearers.</dc:description>
