<dc:title>Log cabin quilt</dc:title>
<dc:description>Log Cabin pattern quilt, hanging on a clothes line. Log Cabin blocks can be placed in different configurations to make overall designs.  The Log Cabin blocks in this quilt have been placed in a design commonly referred to as Streak of Lightning.</dc:description>
<dc:description>While English examples of the Log Cabin quilt pattern are known to exist dating back to the 1830s, it did not become popular in America until around the time of the Civil War. Traditionally, the center of each block represents the hearth of the cabin; and would be made with a red piece of fabric to resemble fire. Each log is then added around the hearth, overlapping the one before, until the cabin is built. Light and dark colors are alternated to represent life containing both joy and sorrow.</dc:description>
