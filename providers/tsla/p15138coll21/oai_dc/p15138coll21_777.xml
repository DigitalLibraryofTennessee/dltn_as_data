<dc:title>Ray Allen and Elaine Lawless in parking lot</dc:title>
<dc:description>Close-up outdoor image of folklorists Ray Allen and Elaine Lawless taken in what appears to be a parking lot. The occasion was a staff meeting for the Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project conducted by Bobby Fulcher and also attended by Jay Orr and Patty Hall.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project began in 1979 under the direction of Park Ranger Bobby Fulcher and continued until 1983.  Each summer during those years, three folklorists were stationed in Tennessee's state parks.  From those bases, they conducted interviews, took photographs, and recorded music with local tradition-bearers.</dc:description>
