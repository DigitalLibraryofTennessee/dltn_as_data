<dc:title>Concrete sculpture on wood</dc:title>
<dc:description>Image of a concrete sculpture on wood somewhat abstractly depicting the nude, female form.  The sculpture hangs on the wall of a front porch.  This is one of a grouping of various images of folk art captured in numerous locations over the course of the Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project began in 1979 under the direction of Park Ranger Bobby Fulcher and continued until 1983.  Each summer during those years, three folklorists were stationed in Tennessee's state parks.  From those bases, they conducted interviews, took photographs, and recorded music with local tradition-bearers.</dc:description>
