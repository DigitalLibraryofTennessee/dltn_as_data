<dc:title>Fife and Drum Interview</dc:title>

<dc:description> 	The Fayette County fife and drum band represented by this contribution gained national attention and joined the list of surviving black fife and drum bands in Mississippi and Georgia. This tradition, arising in the South after the Civil War, and loosely based on militia bands, centered around black community picnics. The picnics occurred during the summer and often on holidays such as July Fourth or Labor Day. </dc:description>
