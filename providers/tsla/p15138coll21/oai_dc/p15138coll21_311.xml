<dc:title>Alma Lee Hodgin Part 1</dc:title>
<dc:description>Audio files of Cumberland County resident Alma Lee Hodgin recorded as part of the Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project.  Hodgin accompanies herself on the guitar, while singing examples of ballads and old time, religious, and country music. Hodgin describes learning to sing, to play the guitar, and to master songs from generations of family members</dc:description>
<dc:description>Hodgins's contribution emphasizes the generations of family members that nutured performers in the Upper Cumberland area and the community support that invested in that talent and provided a stage.  The Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project began in 1979 under the direction of Park Ranger Bobby Fulcher and continued until 1984.  Each summer during those years, folklorists were stationed in Tennessee's state parks.  They conducted interviews, took photos, and recorded music with local tradition-bearers.</dc:description>
