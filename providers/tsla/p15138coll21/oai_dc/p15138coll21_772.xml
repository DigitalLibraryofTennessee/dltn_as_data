<dc:title>Gravestone</dc:title>
<dc:description>A gravestone in the grass, reading "Joseph Ernest Alsup." The location is a cemetery on the Edwards's family land in Hurricane, Tennessee. This image was captured in conjunction with the Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project contribution of long-time Wilson County resident and Cedars of Lebanon State Park Ranger Dick Huddleston.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project began in 1979 under the direction of Park Ranger Bobby Fulcher and continued until 1983.  Each summer during those years, three folklorists were stationed in Tennessee's state parks.  They conducted interviews, took photographs, and recorded music with local tradition-bearers.</dc:description>
