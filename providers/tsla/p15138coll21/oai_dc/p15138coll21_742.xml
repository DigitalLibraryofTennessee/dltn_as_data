<dc:description>Well-known banjo player, singer, and story teller Cayce Russell is pictured with banjo and microphone, playing and singing inside his music store in Lafayette, Tennessee.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Cayce Russell's contribution reflects the history of old time music and instruments, provides historical events of his home county and the Cumberland Plateau, and furnishes history of the early years of the Grand Ole Opry.  The Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project began in 1979 under the direction Park Ranger Bobby Fulcher and continued until 1983.  Folklorists stationed in Tennessee's state parks conducted interviews, took photographs, and recorded music with local tradition-bearers.</dc:description>
