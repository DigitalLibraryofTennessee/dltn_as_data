<dc:title>Log cabin</dc:title>
<dc:description>Small chinked log cabin, with porch and shingled roof.  This log house on Cedars of Lebanon Park land was once the family home of Dick Huddleston.  Long-time Wilson County resident Dick Huddleston became a Cedars of Lebanon park employee.  He passed along valuable information concerning local architectcure and farms and businesses that existed in the area before the establishment of the Cedars of Lebanon State Park through his Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project audio recordings.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project began in 1979 under the direction of Park Ranger Bobby Fulcher and continued until 1983.  Each summer during those years, three folklorists were stationed in Tennessee's state parks.  They conducted interviews,  took photographs, and recorded music with local tradition-bearers.</dc:description>
