<dc:title>Cayce and Donnie Russell Part 4</dc:title>
<dc:description>Audio files of Macon County residents Cayce Russell and Donnie Russell recorded as part of the Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project.  Accompanied by his wife Donnie, Cayce Russell, a well-known banjo player, singer, and storyteller, provides a wide variety of traditional songs, ghost stories, humorous tales, and insight into Grand Ole Opry personalities.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Cayce Russell's contribution reflects the history of old time music and instruments, provides historical events of his home county and the Cumberland Plateau, and furnishes history of the early years of the Grand Ole Opry.  The Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project began in 1979 under the direction Park Ranger Bobby Fulcher and continued until 1983.  Folklorists stationed in Tennessee's state parks conducted interviews, took photographs, and recorded music with local tradition-bearers.</dc:description>
