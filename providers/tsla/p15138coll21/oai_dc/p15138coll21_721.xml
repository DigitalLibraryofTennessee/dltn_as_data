<dc:description>The Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project began in 1979 under the direction of Park Ranger Bobby Fulcher and continued until 1983.  Each summer during those years, three folklorists were stationed in Tennessee's state parks. From those bases, they conducted interviews, took photographs, and recorded music with local tradition-bearers.</dc:description>
