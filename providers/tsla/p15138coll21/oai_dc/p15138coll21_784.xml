<dc:title>Huddleston's Chicken Powder cardboard box</dc:title>
<dc:description>Image of a collapsed Huddleston's Chicken Powder cardboard box.  A drawing of a chicken is featured, and the reputation of sixty-year veteran chicken breeder G. Peck Huddleston is touted.  The powder is said to cure cholera, limp neck, roupe, lice, and mites.  It is to function as a preventative, a restorer of life and vigor, and an enhancer of egg production.  The medicine company was located in Lebanon and related to the family of Cedars of Lebanon State Park's first park ranger, Dick Huddleston.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project began in 1979 under the direction of Park Ranger Bobby Fulcher and continued until 1983.  Each summer during those years, three folklorists were stationed in Tennessee's state parks.  From those bases, they conducted interviews, took photographs, and recorded music with local tradition-bearers.</dc:description>
