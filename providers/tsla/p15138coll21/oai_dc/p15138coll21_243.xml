<dc:title>Dick Huddleston Part 4</dc:title>
<dc:description>Audio files of Wilson County resident Dick Huddleston's oral history recorded as part of the Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project. Huddleston, a Cedars of Lebanon 39-year park employee, farmer, and resident of the area, describes many farms and businesses that existed before the establishment of Cedars of Lebanon State Park. Huddleston, the first park ranger of Cedars of Lebanon State Park, speaks of various homesteads that eventually became part of the park.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Huddleston's contribution furnishes, not only family history, but Wilson County business, agricultural, and architectural history and history of the Cedars of Lebanon State Park.  The Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project began in 1979 under the direction of Park Ranger Bobby Fulcher and continued until 1983.  Each summer during those years, three folklorists were stationed in Tennessee's state parks.  They conducted interviews, took photographs, and recorded music with local tradition-bearers.</dc:description>
