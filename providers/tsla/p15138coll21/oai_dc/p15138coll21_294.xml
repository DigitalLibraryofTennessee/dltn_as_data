<dc:title>Willard Walton Part 1</dc:title>
<dc:description>Audio files of Macon County resident Willard Walton recorded as part of the Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project. Walton, a folk artist, performer, and sassafras tea seller, relates his family history and talks about his creative process.  He demonstrates woodworking and whittling by creating animals from tree stumps and tree roots.  Walton speaks of creating musical instruments fashioned from found objects and of his paintings and drawings.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Walton's contribution highlights a multi-medium folk artist inspired by his family history, his natural surroundings, his life experiences, and his military service in India.  His woodcraft gained national prominence, and advertisements for his walking sticks appeared in New York Magazine as early as the 1970s.  The Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project began in 1979 under the direction of Park Ranger Bobby Fulcher and continued until 1983.</dc:description>
