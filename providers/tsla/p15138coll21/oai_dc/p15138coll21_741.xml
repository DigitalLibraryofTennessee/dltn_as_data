<dc:title>Alma Lee Hodgin playing guitar</dc:title>
<dc:description>Crossville resident Alma Lee Hodgin seated outside playing her guitar.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Hodgins's contribution emphasizes the generations of family members that nutured performers in the Upper Cumberland area and the community support that invested in that talent and provided a stage.  The Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project began in 1979 under the direction of Park Ranger Bobby Fulcher and continued until 1984.  Each summer during those years, folklorists were stationed in Tennessee's state parks.  They conducted interviews, took photos, and recorded music with locals.</dc:description>
