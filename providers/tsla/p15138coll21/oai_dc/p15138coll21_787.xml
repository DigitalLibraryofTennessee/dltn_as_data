<dc:title>Log structure</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pictured is a single-room log pen structure with a metal roof located near Ozone, Tennessee. Its original function could have been that of a corncrib or a smokehouse.  A number of tools, tubs, barrels, and farm implements positioned in and around the building are featured in the image.  A covered tiller sits in front of the structure, and barrels for collecting water sit to the side.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project began in 1979 under the direction of Park Ranger Bobby Fulcher and continued until 1983.  Each summer during those years, three folklorists were stationed in Tennessee's state parks.  From those bases, they conducted interviews, took photographs, and recorded music with local tradition-bearers.</dc:description>
