<dc:title>Clay Childers Part 3</dc:title>
<dc:description>Audio files of McNairy County resident Clay Childers recorded as part of the Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project.  Childers relates his family history and stories of the family farm.  He touches on moonshining and Civil War stories of the Battle of Shiloh.  He describes fashioning chairs and musical instruments and building log cabins.  He plays guitar and performs religious, old time, and country music selections.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Childers's contribution conveys McNairy County social and agricultural history.  His tales of barn raisings and log cabin building reflect aspects of McNairy County folk architecture.  The Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project began in 1979 under the direction of Park Ranger Bobby Fulcher and continued until 1983.  From bases in Tennessee's state parks, folklorists conducted summer interviews, took photographs, and recorded music with local tradition-bearers.</dc:description>
