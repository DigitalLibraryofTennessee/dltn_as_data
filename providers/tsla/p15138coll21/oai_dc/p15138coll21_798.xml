<dc:description>The star design has played a prominent role in quilt patterns since the early 1800s, with the most common being the Bethlehem Star or Lone Star pattern.  The Bethlehem Star pattern features a large central star made up of many small diamonds of; fabric.  The fabric is usually multi-colored, giving the star a kaleidoscope effect.  Around the time of the Civil War, a pattern known as the Ohio Star became popular. Most stars in quilt patterns have four, six, or eight rays.</dc:description>
