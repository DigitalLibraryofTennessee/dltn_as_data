<dc:title>Oak Grove Church of Christ Gospel Group Chester County</dc:title>
<dc:description>Oak Grove Acapella Singers of Chester County being recorded while singing in the office of the preacher at the Oak Grove Church of Christ. Fifteen members comprise this unaccompanied African American religious musical group centered around the Oak Grove Church of Christ of Jacks Creek, Tennessee.  Gospel songs feature solos by several of the members.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The contribution of the Oak Grove Acapella Singers conveys the power of African American gospel and the rich tradition of a capella singing within the Church of Christ.  The Tennessee State Folklife Project began in 1979 under the direction of Park Ranger Bobby Fulcher and continued until 1983.  Each summer during those years, three folklorists were stationed in Tennessee's state parks.  From those bases, they conducted interviews, took photos, and recorded music with local tradition-bearers.</dc:description>
