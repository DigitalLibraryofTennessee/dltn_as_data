<dc:title>Two men with logs</dc:title>
<dc:description>Two men are pictured surrounded by logs. Logger Egbert Atkinson swings on a log loader as Bige Maples looks on. This image represents logging being done out of Stearns Logging's Camp 3, located six miles east of Camp 14.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Egbert Atkinson's images illustrate the impact northern commercial lumber and coal ventures arriving in the Big South Fork area between 1900 and 1920 had on Scott, Pickett, and Fentress Counties.  Michigan-based Stearns Coal and Lumber Company formed in 1902. The company purchased large amounts of land in the Big South Fork area and hugely impacted communities for decades.  The Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project began in 1979 under the direction of Park Ranger Bobby Fulcher and continued until 1983.</dc:description>
