<dc:title>Honeycomb quilt top</dc:title>

<dc:description>The Honeycomb pattern is a traditional one-patch quilt pattern made up of hexagon shaped pieces. Hexagon quilts (like the Honeycomb, Mosaic, and Grandmother's Flower Garden) are usually very time consuming and labor intensive to make with all the pieces being stitched together by hand, typically using a method of construction known as English Paper Piecing. In the English Paper Piecing technique, a paper template is used to back the fabric pieces in order to help sew complex angles together accurately.</dc:description>
