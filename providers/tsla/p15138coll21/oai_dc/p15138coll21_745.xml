<dc:title>James Tatum</dc:title>
<dc:description>West Tennessee fife and drum band member James Tatum sits back in a chair outdoors, cigarette in hand, and relates toasts.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Tatum's contribution brings to light the African American verbal art tradition of the toast.  These long verses or recitations can be traced back to the time of Reconstruction, and they flourished in both rural and urban settings.  Toasts can also be referred to as "brags," and these largely male, heroic expressions can be laced with street slang, obscenities, and misogynistic views.</dc:description>
