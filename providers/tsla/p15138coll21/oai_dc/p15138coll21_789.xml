<dc:description>Dollhouse carved by Polly Page</dc:description>
<dc:description>Polly Page received the 2013 Tennessee Folklife Heritage Award honoring her accomplishments as a woodcarver.  She enrolled in the arts and craft program at Pleasant Hill Academy in 1929 and learned carving under the direction of Margaret Campbell. Page played a leading role in the success of the Pleasant Hill Community Crafts program, arising after the closure of the Academy in the 1940s.  Jane Fonda's character in the 1981 movie "The Dollmaker" was inspired by Polly Page.</dc:description>
