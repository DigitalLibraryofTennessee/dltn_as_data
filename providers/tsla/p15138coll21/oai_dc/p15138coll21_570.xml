<dc:title>James Caldwell</dc:title>
<dc:description>Audio files of Hardin County resident Jim Caldwell recorded as part of the Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project.  Caldwell conveys stories of his personal and family history.  He describes the methods of one of his occupations, water-witching or dousing using a divining rod.  Caldwell also provides an account of digging and repairing wells.  He relates tales of healing warts and thrash, horse trading, and moonshining.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Tennessee folk custom of dousing has ancient origins and accompanying controversy. Dousing references are said to exist in Tassili cave art, Egyptian engravings, Chinese etchings, and Biblical passages. The practice would spread across Europe, and a forked stick, wand, pendulum, or metal rod would be utilized to locate water, mineral ore, and information beyond logical reason.  Dousing also carries with it a connection to healing, as demonstrated by Caldwell's contribution.</dc:description>
