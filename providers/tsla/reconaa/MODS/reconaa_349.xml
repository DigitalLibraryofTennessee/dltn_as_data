  <abstract>A petition to the General Assembly from "white and colored citizens...to repeal the 16th section of the act passed February 20th 1867" which prevented African American men from holding office or sitting on juries. The petition also contains the signatures of 18 white men, two of whom, R. H. Guthrie and Matthew Kelly, signed for the majority of the black petitioners. One man who is identified as "colored" appears to have signed his own name, Lloyd Johnson, amongst the names of the white petitioners. 97 total signatures.</abstract>

      <title>Reconstruction and the African American Legacy in Tennessee</title>
    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>For years, the Reconstruction era marked a tumultuous period in American and Tennessee history. Even before the formal process of Reconstruction began following the Civil War, steps were taken to address the rights of freed slaves and the readmission of Confederate states to the Union. The materials in this collection portray a few of the challenges and victories that emerged during Reconstruction. The focus of the images rests primarily on the Reconstruction period and Gilded Age (1876-1910) in Tennessee following the Civil War.</abstract>
