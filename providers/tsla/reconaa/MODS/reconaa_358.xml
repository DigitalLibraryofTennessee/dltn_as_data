    <topic>Reconstruction (U.S. history, 1865-1877)--Tennessee</topic>
  </subject>
  <abstract>A petition addressed to Gov. Brownlow and both houses of the General Assembly to call a convention for "the purpose of removing the disabilities from all disfranchised citizens" (criminals excepted). Signatures collected from citizens of several counties at an assembly in Tullahoma. In the text of the petition, Bedford County is incorrectly referred to as Bradford County. Although Milford Hobbs is the only signer whose name bears the postscript "Col." there are at least one or two other African American signers and probably more. Notes on signers: Milford Hobbs(?), T.W.S. Blanton.</abstract>

      <title>Reconstruction and the African American Legacy in Tennessee</title>
    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>For years, the Reconstruction era marked a tumultuous period in American and Tennessee history. Even before the formal process of Reconstruction began following the Civil War, steps were taken to address the rights of freed slaves and the readmission of Confederate states to the Union. The materials in this collection portray a few of the challenges and victories that emerged during Reconstruction. The focus of the images rests primarily on the Reconstruction period and Gilded Age (1876-1910) in Tennessee following the Civil War.</abstract>
