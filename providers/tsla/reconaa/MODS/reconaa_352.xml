    <topic>Reconstruction (U.S. history, 1865-1877)--Tennessee</topic>
  </subject>
  <abstract>A petition to the General Assembly from formerly enslaved men and women seeking relief from the hardships they faced following emancipation. Their grievances include being evicted from their former homes (for which they were already paying exorbitant rents to their former masters), being subjected to high taxes to help pay off war debt, and harassment. Although the petition does not specify the race of each signer, due to the nature of the request it is probable that all of the signers were formerly enslaved. Gilbert Russel appears to have signed his own name, while most of the other signatures were marked with an 'x' and witnessed by P.H. Grisham. Rose Smith and Malinda's names are unmarked and unwitnessed. Notes on signers: Gilbert Russel, Alexander Jones, John Davenport, Rose Smith, Malinda (no last name given), Mary Johnson, Harry Rockhold, Elijah Hill, Edmund McGhee, Wiliam Allen, George McMillan.</abstract>

      <title>Reconstruction and the African American Legacy in Tennessee</title>
    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>For years, the Reconstruction era marked a tumultuous period in American and Tennessee history. Even before the formal process of Reconstruction began following the Civil War, steps were taken to address the rights of freed slaves and the readmission of Confederate states to the Union. The materials in this collection portray a few of the challenges and victories that emerged during Reconstruction. The focus of the images rests primarily on the Reconstruction period and Gilded Age (1876-1910) in Tennessee following the Civil War.</abstract>
