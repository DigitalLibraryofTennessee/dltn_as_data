  </subject>
  <abstract>A petition to the General Assembly "For the Passage of the Bill abolishing Disabilities on account of Race or Color." It specifically addresses the "odious 16th section" of the Franchise Act which prevented African Americans from sitting on juries or holding office. None of the petitioners are identified as being African American, but the petition states that they are all members of the Radical Republican Party. They credit their "triumphant success in recent elections...[as] largely due to the votes of Colored men." 107 total signatures.</abstract>

      <title>Reconstruction and the African American Legacy in Tennessee</title>
    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>For years, the Reconstruction era marked a tumultuous period in American and Tennessee history. Even before the formal process of Reconstruction began following the Civil War, steps were taken to address the rights of freed slaves and the readmission of Confederate states to the Union. The materials in this collection portray a few of the challenges and victories that emerged during Reconstruction. The focus of the images rests primarily on the Reconstruction period and Gilded Age (1876-1910) in Tennessee following the Civil War.</abstract>
