    <topic>United States - History - Civil War, 1861-1865</topic>
  </subject>
  <abstract>Scrap of a military record denoting the first names of negro enlistments in Colored Infantry Regiments. Also mentioned are some officers with the units. The notation of Gallatin and the date of 1863 most probably is associated with the formation of the 40th Colored Infantry or a mistaken date reference to their later Gallatin service, since the 42nd was not authorized to form until 1864. The reference to the 41st Colored Infantry is puzzling, since the 41st was comprised of Pennsylvannia men.</abstract>

      <title>Reconstruction and the African American Legacy in Tennessee</title>
    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>For years, the Reconstruction era marked a tumultuous period in American and Tennessee history. Even before the formal process of Reconstruction began following the Civil War, steps were taken to address the rights of freed slaves and the readmission of Confederate states to the Union. The materials in this collection portray a few of the challenges and victories that emerged during Reconstruction. The focus of the images rests primarily on the Reconstruction period and Gilded Age (1876-1910) in Tennessee following the Civil War.</abstract>
