    <topic>Reconstruction (U.S. history, 1865-1877)--Tennessee</topic>
  </subject>
  <abstract>A petition to the General Assembly to "remove the cause of dissention" that has resulted from "the whole sale disfranchisement of her [the state of Tennessee] citizens." The petitioners also request "to make the Clerk of the County Court, Registrar, and require the Sheriffs to hold the elections." Although the petition is from "the undersigned, Colored Citizens of Shelby County," only one of the signers is specifically identified as "colored." Many of the other names appear to have been written in the same 2 or 3 hands with each petitioner making his mark with an 'x'. Notes on signers: Chas H. Edmonson; 44 total signatures.</abstract>

      <title>Reconstruction and the African American Legacy in Tennessee</title>
    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>For years, the Reconstruction era marked a tumultuous period in American and Tennessee history. Even before the formal process of Reconstruction began following the Civil War, steps were taken to address the rights of freed slaves and the readmission of Confederate states to the Union. The materials in this collection portray a few of the challenges and victories that emerged during Reconstruction. The focus of the images rests primarily on the Reconstruction period and Gilded Age (1876-1910) in Tennessee following the Civil War.</abstract>
