<dc:title>Harper's Weekly Memphis riot scenes</dc:title>
<dc:description>Race relations riot that occurred in Memphis in May of 1866. The black population of Memphis had swelled from 4,000 to over 15,000 by 1865. The volatile mix of former slaves or contraband, long-time freedmen of the Beale Street area, four regiments of Colored Troops, the Irish police force, and the suffering poor clashed in South Memphis for several days with the resulting deaths of 44 blacks and two whites and the loss for blacks of 91 houses, 12 schools, and four churches.

<dc:description>Harper's Weekly was an American political magazine published out of New York City from 1857 to 1916. Noted for its wood-engraved illustrations, the newspaper presented some startling images of the racism and violence that raged across the South during the Reconstruction period. After the Civil War, the publication advocated the Republican crusade for civil rights for freedmen.</dc:description>
