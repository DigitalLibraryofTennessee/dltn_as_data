<dc:title>I am bound for the fair at Columbia!</dc:title>
<dc:description>Broadside promoting the Maury County Colored Fair that was scheduled for November 8, 1883. Participants were urged to take the train from Fayetteville, Lincoln County, or Lewisburg, Marshall County, in order to get to the fair. The cost of the round trip from Fayetteville was $2.25 and from Lewisburg, $1.50. Tickets were good for three days. The general manager of the event was posted as Rev. J. F. Humphreys.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The colored fairs did not last long in Maury County, and they were not held at the same time that the white fairs were held, which was usually on Labor Day.The colored fair in Columbia took place at the College Hill School, which was built in 1881. There were frequent social interactions between African Americans in Lincoln County and Maury County. This event may have been a promotional idea developed by the railway, which had recently built some rail lines in the area.</dc:description>
