<dc:description>Central Tennessee College was founded in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1866, under the auspices of the Freedmen's Aid Society. The school began in an old Gun Factory in Nashville. By the 1870s, a house and lot were purchased on Maple Street in Nashville. The school was designed primarily as a teacher college, although students could study to enter Meharry Medical College. The tuition was $1.00 per month, and $2.00 for board. In 1883 the enrollment was 360 students.</dc:description>
