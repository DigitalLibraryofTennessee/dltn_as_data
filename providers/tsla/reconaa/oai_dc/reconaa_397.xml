<dc:title>Colored Citizens' Petition for the Restoration of Voting Rights</dc:title>
<dc:description>A petition to the General Assembly to "remove the cause of dissention" that has resulted from "the whole sale disfranchisement of her [the state of Tennessee] citizens." The petitioners also request "to make the Clerk of the County Court, Registrar, and require the Sheriffs to hold the elections." Although the petition is from "the undersigned, Colored Citizens of Shelby County," only one of the signers is specifically identified as "colored." Many of the other names appear to have been written in the same 2 or 3 hands with each petitioner making his mark with an 'x'. Notes on signers: Chas H. Edmonson; 44 total signatures.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Gov. William Brownlow and the Radical Republican legislature enacted a series of punitive bills aimed at disenfranchising former Confederates. In 1865, former Confederate soldiers and politicians were denied the vote for a limited period of time. By 1867, anyone accused of having any Confederate sympathies were disenfranchised indefinitely and strict methods of voter registration were employed. Despite granting African Americans the right to vote in 1867, the punitive bills against conservatives effectively disqualified nine out of ten voters in the state. Such harsh measures incited the formation of the Ku Klux Klan, whose violence and intimidation (largely against African Americans) prompted the establishment of the State Guard to keep order. Rising tensions and fear of the outbreak of another civil war caused many to petition the legislature for the restoration of voting rights to conservatives and former Confederates. These sometimes included African Americans who bore the brunt of racial violence.</dc:description>
