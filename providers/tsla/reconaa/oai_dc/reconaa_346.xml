<dc:title>Hamilton County Petition Against the Repeal of the Free School System</dc:title>
<dc:description>A petition to the General Assembly from "Colored Citizens" protesting a possible repeal of the Free School System for African American children. The petition also references the "persecutions, threatenings, the destruction of our crops, the robbing of the rewards of our industry, and the whippings, and hangings, and shooting, and murders endured by our race." The petition is headed as a "Colored Citizens' Petition," although none of the signers are specifically identified as "colored." Four of the petition's signators also wrote individual statements of support for the Free Schools. 124 total signatures.</dc:description>
<dc:description>After the Civil War, Radical Republican governments helped to establish free public schools across the south to educate both black and white children. The Free Schools received immense support from African Americans in particular, and the schools educated freed adults in addition to children. Not merely an educational tool, the schools represented a way out of poverty for newly freed people struggling to build their lives. The Free School system was a political flashpoint for white conservative backlash as the frustration of disenfranchised former rebels clashed with African Americans who rallied around the cause of protecting the schools and petitioned the legislature for such protections.  </dc:description>
