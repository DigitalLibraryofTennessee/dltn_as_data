<dc:title>Radical Republican Petition to Allow African Americans to Hold Public Ofice</dc:title>
<dc:description>A petition to the General Assembly "For the Passage of the Bill abolishing Disabilities on account of Race or Color." It specifically addresses the "odious 16th section" of the Franchise Act which prevented African Americans from sitting on juries or holding office. None of the petitioners are identified as being African American, but the petition states that they are all members of the Radical Republican Party. They credit their "triumphant success in recent elections...[as] largely due to the votes of Colored men." 107 total signatures.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Franchise Act of 1867 was passed as an amendment to Brownlow's 1866 "Act to limit the elective franchise," which effectively disenfranchised many white men in Tennessee. It gave the right to vote all male citizens of the state, aged 21 and older, provided they had no association with the Confederacy whatsoever. Although the Franchise Act extended voting rights to African Americans, its 16th Section stated, "That this act shall not be so construed as to allow the colored man to hold office or sit on juries." Their voting rights secured, African Americans across the state petitioned the legislature for the removal of these disabilities and for full citizenship rights. African Americans proved to be a potent political force and, after helping to sweep the Radical Republicans back into power in the election of August 1867, the General Assembly finally voted to remove these disabilities in January 1868.</dc:description>
