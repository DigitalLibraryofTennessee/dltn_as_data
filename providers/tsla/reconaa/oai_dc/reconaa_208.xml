<dc:title>Fayetteville's First Annual Colored Agricultural and Mechanical Fair</dc:title>
<dc:description>Broadside advertising a three-day fair to be staged at the Fayetteville Fairgrounds beginning October 10, 1872. This was to be the first annual fair of the Tennessee Colored Agricultural and Mechanical Association to be held in Fayetteville. Officers and Directors are listed on the placard.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Founded in Tennessee around 1866, this organization's black leaders were businessmen, artisans, craftsmen and politicians. They sought to teach and solidify agricultural, crafting, and mechanical skills among freedmen. The Association also provided a political base for its leaders, given that annual fall fairs drew freedmen together and would sometimes bring in national black leaders to Tennessee. Leaders were influenced by Franklin College and would found the Tennessee Manual Labor University.</dc:description>
