<dc:description>The Fisk Jubilee Singers are a group of African American singers first organized in 1871. Their early repertoire centered on spirituals, but also included some Stephen Foster songs. The singers were a fundraising effort for Fisk University, a historically black university in Nashville, Tennessee. After a tour of Europe in 1873, the group earned enough money to send back to Fisk to construct the university's first-ever permanent building. The building was named Jubilee Hall, and it is still standing today.</dc:description>
