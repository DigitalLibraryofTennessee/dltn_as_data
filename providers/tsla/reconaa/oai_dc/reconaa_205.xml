<dc:title>A letter of advice</dc:title>
<dc:description>Broadside entitled "A Letter of Advice: To the Grand Order--the K.K. Klan-- throughout the U. States and Territories of America." The broadside was purportedly written by Nathan Bedford Forrest.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The first Klan was founded in 1865 by veterans of the Confederate Army. Its purpose was to restore white supremacy in the aftermath of the American Civil War. The Klan resisted Reconstruction by intimidating "carpetbaggers", "scalawags" and freedmen. The KKK quickly adopted violent methods. The increase in murders finally resulted in a backlash among Southern elites who viewed the Klan's excesses as an excuse for federal troops to continue occupation. The organization declined from 1868 to 1870.</dc:description>
