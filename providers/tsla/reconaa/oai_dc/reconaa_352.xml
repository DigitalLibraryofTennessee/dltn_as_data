<dc:title>Knoxville Petition from Formerly Enslaved Citizens</dc:title>
<dc:description>A petition to the General Assembly from formerly enslaved men and women seeking relief from the hardships they faced following emancipation. Their grievances include being evicted from their former homes (for which they were already paying exorbitant rents to their former masters), being subjected to high taxes to help pay off war debt, and harassment. Although the petition does not specify the race of each signer, due to the nature of the request it is probable that all of the signers were formerly enslaved. Gilbert Russel appears to have signed his own name, while most of the other signatures were marked with an 'x' and witnessed by P.H. Grisham. Rose Smith and Malinda's names are unmarked and unwitnessed. Notes on signers: Gilbert Russel, Alexander Jones, John Davenport, Rose Smith, Malinda (no last name given), Mary Johnson, Harry Rockhold, Elijah Hill, Edmund McGhee, Wiliam Allen, George McMillan.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Radical Republican control of state government was an era of increased expectations for African Americans. While political rights were gradually obtained, the impoverishment of newly freed people presented an urgent problem. This eloquent and emotional petition describes the desperate circumstances of struggling people in Knoxville and implores the legislature for aid. </dc:description>
