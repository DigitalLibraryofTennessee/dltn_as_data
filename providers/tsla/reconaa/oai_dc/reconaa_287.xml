<dc:title>Tennessee pension application of ex-slave</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pension application of a former slave in Tennessee named Ben Davis. The information indicates that Davis was "given" to Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest as a personal servent during the Civil War.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Beginning in 1891, Tennessee allowed pensions to be given to veterans of the Civil War residing in the state. Proof of disability and/or indigency was required along with proof of having left the service honorably. African Americans were eligible although they had to have a statement from a white resident testifying that the applicant's "habits are good and free of dishonor."</dc:description>
