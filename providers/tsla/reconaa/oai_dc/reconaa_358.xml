<dc:title>Tullahoma Assembly Petition for the Restoration of Voting Rights</dc:title>
<dc:description>A petition addressed to Gov. Brownlow and both houses of the General Assembly to call a convention for "the purpose of removing the disabilities from all disfranchised citizens" (criminals excepted). Signatures collected from citizens of several counties at an assembly in Tullahoma. In the text of the petition, Bedford County is incorrectly referred to as Bradford County. Although Milford Hobbs is the only signer whose name bears the postscript "Col." there are at least one or two other African American signers and probably more. Notes on signers: Milford Hobbs(?), T.W.S. Blanton.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Gov. William Brownlow and the Radical Republican legislature enacted a series of punitive bills aimed at disenfranchising former Confederates. In 1865, former Confederate soldiers and politicians were denied the vote for a limited period of time. By 1867, anyone accused of having any Confederate sympathies were disenfranchised indefinitely and strict methods of voter registration were employed. Despite granting African Americans the right to vote in 1867, the punitive bills against conservatives effectively disqualified nine out of ten voters in the state. Such harsh measures incited the formation of the Ku Klux Klan, whose violence and intimidation (largely against African Americans) prompted the establishment of the State Guard to keep order. Rising tensions and fear of the outbreak of another civil war caused many to petition the legislature for the restoration of voting rights to conservatives and former Confederates. These sometimes included African Americans who bore the brunt of racial violence.     </dc:description>
