<dc:title>Colored Citizens' Petition Against the Repeal of the Free School System</dc:title>
<dc:description>A "Colored Citizens' Petition" to the General Assembly protesting the repeal of the Free School System. Like the other Free School petitions, the race of each individual signer is unspecified. 37 total signatures.</dc:description>
<dc:description>After the Civil War, Radical Republican governments helped to establish free public schools across the south to educate both black and white children. The Free Schools received immense support from African Americans in particular, and the schools educated freed adults in addition to children. Not merely an educational tool, the schools represented a way out of poverty for newly freed people struggling to build their lives. The Free School system was a political flashpoint for white conservative backlash as the frustration of disenfranchised former rebels clashed with African Americans who rallied around the cause of protecting the schools and petitioned the legislature for such protections. </dc:description>
