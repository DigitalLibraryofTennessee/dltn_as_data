<dc:description>Harper's Weekly was an American political magazine published out of New York City from 1857 to 1916. The publication was noted for its wood engravings. After the Civil War, the publication advocated the Republican crusade for civil rights for freedmen. The series of sketched portraits that are contained within this issue were probably done by artist correspondent Alfred R. Waud. He and other "special artists" were sent out by the leading weeklies to cover the war and its aftermath.</dc:description>
