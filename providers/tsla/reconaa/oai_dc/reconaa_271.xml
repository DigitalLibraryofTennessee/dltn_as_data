<dc:title>Freedmen extract includes diary of Memphis Colored Orphan Asylum</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pages 15 through 24 of a pamphlet containing diary entries from Mrs. S. A. Martha Canfield with regard to the Memphis Colored Orphan Asylum that she founded. Mrs. Canfield observed the efforts of Rev. I. J. Hoile with the colored schools of the city and sought to help him expand his work. With the help of the Memphis citizenry, a Board of Trustees, the Freedmen's Bureau, the military, and benevolent agencies, she set up the Asylum in the former Charleston Hotel in November of 1864.</dc:description>
<dc:description>In Canfield's 1865 report to Col. John Eaton, Jr., General Superintendent of Refugees and Freedmen, she lists 100 orphans present at the institution. The Asylum retained a matron, an assistant, a teacher, a surgeon, and servants. Destitute freedmen in need of food and clothing were not turned away from the Asylum.</dc:description>
