<dc:title>Freedman Employment Office form</dc:title>
<dc:description>Duplicate form representing an official contract recorded in the Freedman Employment Office in Louisville, Kentucky, between an employer and a freedman. A specific period of employment is outlined, along with provisions for quarters and medicines, procedu res for lost work time, and the consequences of breaching the contract. A decorative seal featuring an eagle, shield, and the motto of the Great Seal appears before the backdrop of scenes and tools of labor below appears another motto dealing with labor.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The document reveals this office had no connection to the Freedmen's Bureau or the military. High military authorities and officials with the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands were consulted and gave authorization for the formation of the office. These authorities also offered to enforce proper contracts from this office. The Bureau and such agencies sought to oversee labor arrangements involving freed slaves in an effort to protect them and help to insure "Fair Work for Fair Wages."</dc:description>
