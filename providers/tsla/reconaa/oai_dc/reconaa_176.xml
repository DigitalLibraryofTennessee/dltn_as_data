<dc:title>Howard physician on his rounds in Memphis</dc:title>
<dc:description>Howard physician of Memphis visiting patients stricken with yellow fever communicates the dire situation that the city faced during its 1870s public health nightmare.</dc:description>
<dc:description>In 1873, Yellow Fever was carried up the Mississippi River from New Orleans to Memphis. A resurgence of the disease in 1878 caused thousands to flee the city. The Howard Association, originating in New Orleans and named after a British philanthropist and reformer, came to Memphis in 1855 during the yellow fever outbreak. The young men dispensed aid, hired doctors and nurses, and organized burials.</dc:description>
