<dc:description>The Freedmen's Bureau was a U.S. federal government agency that aided distressed refugees of the American Civil War. The Freedmen's Bureau Bill, which created the Bureau, was initiated by President Abraham Lincoln and intended to last for one year after the end of the war. Passed on March 3, 1865, by Congress to aid former slaves through education, health care, and employment, it became later a key agency in the first years of Reconstruction aiding primarily the newly freed slaves.</dc:description>
