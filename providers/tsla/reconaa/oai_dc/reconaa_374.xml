<dc:title>Colored Citizens' Petition to Allow African Americans to Hold Public Office</dc:title>
<dc:description>A petition to the General Assembly from "coloured" voters for the repeal of any laws that prevent "the coloured people of Tennessee from holding office or occupying any possition [sic] of honor or trust." In addition to the names of the African American petitioners, the last page of the petition also has a "White List" consisting of 29 signatures, and a "Radacal Partay" [sic] list consisting of 23 signatures. 345 total signatures.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Franchise Act of 1867 was passed as an amendment to Brownlow's 1866 "Act to limit the elective franchise," which effectively disenfranchised many white men in Tennessee. It gave the right to vote all male citizens of the state, aged 21 and older, provided they had no association with the Confederacy whatsoever. Although the Franchise Act extended voting rights to African Americans, its 16th Section stated, "That this act shall not be so construed as to allow the colored man to hold office or sit on juries." Their voting rights secured, African Americans across the state petitioned the legislature for the removal of these disabilities and for full citizenship rights. African Americans proved to be a potent political force and, after helping to sweep the Radical Republicans back into power in the election of August 1867, the General Assembly finally voted to remove these disabilities in January 1868.</dc:description>
