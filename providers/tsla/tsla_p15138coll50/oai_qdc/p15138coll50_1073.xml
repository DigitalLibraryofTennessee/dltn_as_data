<dc:description>Tennis Club group.</dc:description>
<dc:description>These people were original settlers of Rugby. In his book on Rugby, Thomas Hughes wrote "The Rugby Tennis Club consists to-day of seven members, five English and two native, and will probably reach two figures within a few days, on the return of the boys.

Such are infant communities in these latitudes!"</dc:description>
