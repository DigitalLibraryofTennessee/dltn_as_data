<dc:description>The Sparta Hydroelectric Station is located on the right (north) bank of the Calfkiller River. Construction of the extant Sparta hydrostation was begun at the present site and was completed in 1909. This new plant was located on the Calfkiller River about a mile downstream from where the first hydroelectric station in Sparta had burned in 1907. Remnants of the hydroelectric flume are still visible today as it once crisscrossed the river on a suspension cradle made of wire and wood. The flume is long gone, but its harnesses still hang high above the gorge.</dc:description>
