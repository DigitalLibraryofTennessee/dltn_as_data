<dc:description>Napier Iron Ore furnace.</dc:description>
<dc:description>During the nineteenth century, iron making was a big industry in Tennessee. Most of the iron making was done in the Western Highland Rim where all the necessities such as accessible ore deposits, limestone for smelting, wood for fuel, and rivers for transportation were found in abundance. With the increased development of the railroad lines after the Civil War, Chattanooga and other East Tennessee communities also became prominent places for the iron industry. One of the companies that developed during the nineteenth century was the Napier Iron Works. Nearby the iron works was a village of Napier that came into existence about 1890 when the Napier Iron Works was organized and the installation of modern mining and smelting equipment was made. When it was in full production, the company employed 160 men. Sixty of those men worked in the mines, while 100 men worked at the furnace. These men and their families occupied the company houses that they rented for $3.50 a month. Their needs were supplied from the company commissary. The ironworks operated from 1890 until 1923.</dc:description>
