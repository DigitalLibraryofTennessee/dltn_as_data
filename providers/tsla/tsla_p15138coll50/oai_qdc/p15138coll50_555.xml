<dc:description>In 1916, the Carolina, Clinchfield, and Ohio Railroad selected Erwin, a small town in northeastern Tennessee, as the site for a pottery. In 1916, Grosvenor Atterbury, a New York City architect, was engaged by the railroad's land holding affiliate, Holston Corporation, to draw up a planned community. Two basic house plans were utilized to construct approximately fifty homes intended to house pottery employees. By the time World War II broke out, Southern Potteries ranked as one of the largest producers of china in the United States. Production reached its peak in the early 1940s. From the 1930's to 1957, Southern Potteries manufactured Blue Ridge China, a brand and range of American tableware (dishware).</dc:description>
