<dc:title>Gernt Children</dc:title>
<dc:description>Four children sitting in an Arbuckles Roasted Coffee shipping case. One of the children shown is Walter (1892-1982), the son of Bruno Gernt (1851-1932), who was the first German settler in the town. The other children are most likely some of Walter's brothers and sisters.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Bruno Gernt controlled more land than any other man residing in Fentress county. He also engaged in the mercantile business at Wilder, Tenn. He did much to develop the value of Cumberland Mountain land and to interest non-residents in securing homes here, and was always found at the front in every movement for the development and improvement of the county. He also had a real estate office at Allardt, Tenn.</dc:description>
