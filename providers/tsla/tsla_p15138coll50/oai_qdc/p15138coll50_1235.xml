<dc:description>Hohenwald, founded by German immigrants Augusta Smith and Warren Smith in 1878, is named for the German word for "High Forest" which relates to the location. New Switzerland, a new town in the area, developed in the 1890s with the introduction of the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway. At the time, Swiss-American J. G. Probst saw the opportunity to establish Swiss Colonies in the United States and purchased 13,000 acres in Middle Tennessee. To bring Swiss settlers to the area, Probst established the Swiss Pioneer Union and advertised via German newspapers and pamphlets to Swiss American farmers in the Midwest. The first Swiss settlers arrived in 1895 to find that the community had not been established, and as a result, created the town of New Switzerland. Tension between the two communities became an issue and a court trial resulted in a decree to merge the two towns under the name of Hohenwald. Swiss heritage continued to play a large part in the area's history, with plays such as the annual production of Friedrich Schiller's "Wilhelm Tell" play, folk dances, and musical groups such as "Echoes of Switzerland" and "Alpenroesli" maintaining traditions.</dc:description>
