<dc:description>Located along scenic US 41 in Grundy County, Tennessee, just 4 miles NW of Monteagle, is Wonder Cave. It was long considered by many to be one of the State's premier show caves and for more than a century Wonder Cave operated as a commercial cave. Prior to being known as Wonder Cave, this area was once referred to as the "Big Spring" by locals. Wonder cave closed in 1986. It reopened as part of a bed and breakfast in 1989, then closed again in 2000.</dc:description>
