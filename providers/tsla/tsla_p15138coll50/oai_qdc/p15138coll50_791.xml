<dc:title>Monkey Joe Mendi</dc:title>
<dc:description>Joe Mendi, a monkey, performing for two Black children, operating a camera.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The monkey was allowed to live at a boarding house on East Third Avenue. He had all kinds of toys and lots of clothing. Joe (also known as Jo) became a popular member of Broadway and the vaudeville circuit after he was purchased by circus-owner Lew Backenstoe, who&#8217;s wife trained the chimp to perform human-like tricks. The trio set out on tour around the country, billed as &#8220;Joe Mendi, the eighteen-month old chimpanzee with the intelligence of a five year old child.&#8221;One of his most famous cameos came during his time in Dayton, Tennessee for the Scopes Monkey Trial in 1925. For the entirety of the media circus, Joe played a miniature piano, posed for photographs and even drank coke at the local soda counter.</dc:description>
