  <abstract>Dedication of Holy Cross Catholic Church on East Wood Street. Shown are: Monsignor Merlin G. Kearney; Bishop Joseph Durick; Friar Patrick Heenan; Monsignor Joseph Leppert.</abstract>
  <abstract>The first recorded gathering for Mass took place in the home of Mr. &amp; Mrs. James M. Dean on Depot Street in Paris in 1901. Mass was said only once a month at that time and for several years thereafter, continued to be offered in various homes. As the number of Catholics increased, a larger place was needed, so Sunday use of the Odd Fellows Hall was arranged. With the growth of Paris and the continuous increase in the size of the congregation, the need for a larger and more permanent church structure became evident. A lot was purchased on West Wood Street and plans drawn up for the original church. In 1921, the cornerstone was laid and with the completion of the construction, the dedication ceremony was held on June 18, 1922, with Msgr. D. J. Murphy, Vicar General of the Diocese of Nashville, officiating.</abstract>
