  <abstract>Black and white photograph of the exterior of All Saints Chapel.</abstract>
  <abstract>All Saints' Chapel, a replacement to the old wooden Saint Augustine's Chapel, broke ground in 1904, and construction started in 1905. The 1904 plans for the building were created by New York architect Ralph Adams Cram. The 1907 financial panic that resulted in the failure of the Bank of Winchester caused construction to be delayed, and a temporary wooden floor and ceiling had to be created so that it could be used. The final stages of construction wouldn't occur until 1957, and at that point, the plans used for completing the chapel were based on exterior plans from 1937 that Dr. Edward McCrady, the vice-chancellor, had drawn. Inspiration for the building plans came from different sources with the tower being based on the Saint Mary the Virgin at the University Church at Oxford University, the vaulted ceilings after Chartres and Amiens in France, and the rose window modeled after Notre Dame de Paris in France.</abstract>
