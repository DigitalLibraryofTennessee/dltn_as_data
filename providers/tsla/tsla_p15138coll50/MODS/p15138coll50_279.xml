  <abstract>A street scene looking down Alleghany Avenue with the depot on the right behind where the people are gathering. To the left starts the main part of town.</abstract>
  <abstract>One of the warehouses in the center was used to store coffins. In 1876, Lorenzo Thompson established Thompson's Stand, a general store located a few miles east of modern Greenback. In 1882, Thompson applied for federal post office. He initially hoped to use the name "Thompson's Station," but the name was already in use. After several other names were rejected, Thompson settled on "Greenback," a name inspired by the local Greenback Party politician, Jonathan Tipton.</abstract>
