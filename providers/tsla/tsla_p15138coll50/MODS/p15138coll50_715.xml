  <abstract>Building of Walker's Ford Bridge on Clinch River.</abstract>
  <abstract>The bridge was demolished as a result of the building of Norris Dam in 1935. Walker's Ford was a thriving community on both banks of the Clinch River, with a ford and ferry crossing apparently from modern Walker's Ford Road in Union County on the west to Bear Creek Road in Claiborne County on the east. The community had its own post office, stores, and a number of homes. It was also a starting point or waystation for farmers taking their goods downriver on flatboats for sale. Walker's Ford was a major crossing point of the Clinch, although there were fords nearby. Troops, bandits, and everyone else crossed at Walker's Ford during the Civil War, with a skirmish fought there 2 December 1863.The area was inundated with the building of Norris Dam.</abstract>
