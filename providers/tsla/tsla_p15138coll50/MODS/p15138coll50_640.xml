  <abstract>Jacob Brown purchased the property and surrounding land from the Cherokee Indians after settling in Tennessee from North Carolina. The Jacob Brown Grant Deeds, also known more simply as the Nolichucky Grants, were transactions for the sale of land by the Cherokee Nation to Jacob Brown. The transaction occurred at Sycamore Shoals on the Watauga River on March 25, 1775. Since the 1700s the property was owned by descandants of Jacob Brown. The Brown home was built in 1840. There is an original grist mill general store/post office smoke house and spring house are located on the property. Jacob Brown was a wagonmaker.</abstract>
