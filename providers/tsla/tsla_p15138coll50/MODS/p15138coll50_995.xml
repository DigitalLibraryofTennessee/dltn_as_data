  <abstract>Gideon Riggs home, Riggs Crossroads. There are people in the front yard.</abstract>
  <abstract>Gideon Wright Riggs, Sr. (1790-1871) moved with his father David Riggs to Williamson County in 1810 to take possession of a farm of eight hundred or a thousand acres of land. He fought in the battle of New Orleans under General Andrew Jackson. A Turnpike ran North and South through his farm and a county road ran East and West through it. Gideon built a two story brick house at the intersection of these roads, and thus named. Gideon kept a post office named, “Riggs Crossroads,” near the town of College Grove. He donated the land for one of the first Christian churches in the county, which is still an active congregation. Riggs Crossroads is located between Chapel Hill and Eagleville off Highway 31.</abstract>
