  <abstract>Exterior of the Franklin Theatre. There is a large crowd of people standing in front of the building with bicycles.</abstract>
  <abstract>The Franklin Theatre opened its doors on July 15, 1937 in what had been a car dealership- the old Hunter Motor Company building on Main Street. The first feature ever there was Night Must Fall, starring Robert Montgomery and Rosaline Russell. Admission was 10 cents for children and a quarter for adults. It is fondly known as the “Home of First Kisses.” The theatre shut down in 2007 but was saved and refurbished by the Heritage Foundation and reopened 4 years later.</abstract>
