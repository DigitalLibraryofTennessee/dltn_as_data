  <abstract>Members of the Tomato Club near a statue. Caption Reads: "Miss Bettie Smithson second from right, prepares for an outing with members of one of Warren County's early Tomato Clubs, which later with the extension of the Warren County Agricultural Extension Services became 4-H. Miss Smithson was the county's first extension agent. Also included in the picture is Miss Susie Moffitt Roach of McMinnville, owner of the photo, who remembers well those early days of canning and sewing and other projects sponsored by the Extension Service."</abstract>
