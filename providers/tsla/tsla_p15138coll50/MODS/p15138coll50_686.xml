  <abstract>Black and white photograph of the Casey Jones Engine No. 382. The photograph was taken when the train was on its way to the scrapyard in 1935.</abstract>
  <abstract>Jonthan Luther "Casey" Jones (1863 - 1900) was a railroader, from Jackson, Tennessee, who worked for the Illinois Central Railroad. He was killed on April 30, 1900 when his train Engine No. 382 collied with the caboose of a stalled freight train. His death made him a folk hero, as he died trying to stop his train and save the life of his passengers. Engine No. 383 was saved and is now at the Casey Jones Village in Jackson, Tennessee.</abstract>
