  <abstract>Exterior of Nolensville High School, located off of Nolensville Road.</abstract>
  <abstract>In addition to serving students for nearly four decades, the historic school near the center of Nolensville has also been a farm, a recreation center, a library and a museum. The Nolensville school building is based on a design that was used to build thousands of schools for black children between 1917 and 1932. Those schools, called Rosenwald schools, are becoming increasingly rare. The school ran from 1937-1975. The building now houses the Nolensville Historical Society and Museum.</abstract>
