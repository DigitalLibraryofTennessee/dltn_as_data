  <abstract>Postcard Photograph of Willow Plunge swimming pool, Franklin, Tennessee.</abstract>
  <abstract>Located at the corner of Lewisburg Pike and Carnton Lane, Willow Plunge held not just the largest outdoor concrete swimming pool in the south, but tennis courts, a 9-hole golf course, a mini-golf course, a football field, aviation field and lake. It was built by Claiborne Kinnard in 1924 on what was his property and what is now the Heath Place subdivision. Willow Plunge was open from the 1920's to the 1967. The Plunge also had dressing rooms, a concession stand, a pinball and jukebox room, a coffee shop and a pavilion, where local bands would play.</abstract>
