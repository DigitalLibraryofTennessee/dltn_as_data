  <abstract>Nashville Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway Engine #134 and coal car coming from Dickson.</abstract>
  <abstract>During the 1870s - 1900s, America and Tennessee experienced a boom in railroads. Railroads offered a reliable and weatherproof means of transportation for the shipping of goods from one place to another. In Tennessee, the most prominent railroads that formed were the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L &amp; N) and the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railroad (N.C. &amp; St. L.). As a result of the development of railroads, Tennessee cities grew into shipping and manufacturing centers. In addition, communities that were on the railroad line became a part of regional, national, and international marketing networks.</abstract>
