  <abstract>Joe Mendi, a monkey, performing for two Black children, operating a camera.</abstract>
  <abstract>The monkey was allowed to live at a boarding house on East Third Avenue. He had all kinds of toys and lots of clothing. Joe (also known as Jo) became a popular member of Broadway and the vaudeville circuit after he was purchased by circus-owner Lew Backenstoe, who’s wife trained the chimp to perform human-like tricks. The trio set out on tour around the country, billed as “Joe Mendi, the eighteen-month old chimpanzee with the intelligence of a five year old child.”One of his most famous cameos came during his time in Dayton, Tennessee for the Scopes Monkey Trial in 1925. For the entirety of the media circus, Joe played a miniature piano, posed for photographs and even drank coke at the local soda counter.</abstract>
