  <abstract>Nolensville Colored School which was located on Rocky Fork Road.</abstract>
  <abstract>The Nolensville Colored School burned to the ground in June of 1995. The school opened in 1943, after the Methodist church building in which Nolensville's African American children were being taught was condemned. The school had outhouses, no running water or electricity, and about 50 students and two teachers, grades one through eight. The school closed in 1966 after integration.</abstract>
