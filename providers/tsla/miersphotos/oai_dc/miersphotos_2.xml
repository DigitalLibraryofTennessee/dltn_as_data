<dc:title>"City of Memphis" at river landing</dc:title>
<dc:description>The "City of Memphis" is moored at the shore while cargo is loaded via a boom gangplank. Several well dressed men and women seem to be waiting to board. The tall stacks are belching black smoke in preparation for moving. Individuals are shown on all three decks.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The "City of Memphis" was built at Jeffersonville, Indiana, in 1898, for the St. Louis &amp; Tennessee River Packet Company. She was placed in the St. Louis and Memphis trade in competition with the "Georgia Lee" and a rate war resulted. She then went to the Tennessee River trade until 1910 when bought by Captain Tom Horrissy of Vicksburg, Mississippi, and renamed "S.B. Duncan," in January 1900. When in the St. Louis-Memphis trade she sank while crossing from Rosa Lodge, Arkansas, to Gold Dust, Tennessee.</dc:description>
