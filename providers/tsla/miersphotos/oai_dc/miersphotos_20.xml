<dc:title>Carnegie Public Library</dc:title>
<dc:description>Substantial two-story brick building built in the classical style. A domed cupola adorns the roof. Round windows complement the six-sided lower part of dome. Two narrow arched windows are set on either side of the front door which features a large fanlight. Symmetrical elements enrich the building's exterior. Four stone Ionic columns grace the facade, and carved on the entablature is "Carnegie Public Library". Snow covers the ground.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Andrew Carnegie immigrated with his family from Scotland in 1848. He struck it rich in the exploding American steel industry of the late 19th century and chose philanthropy over accumulating wealth. Carnegie spent over $40 million to build free libraries in some 1,400 U.S. communities. By the time he died in 1919, he had given away 90 per cent of his $300 billion fortune. The library's location is unknown.</dc:description>
