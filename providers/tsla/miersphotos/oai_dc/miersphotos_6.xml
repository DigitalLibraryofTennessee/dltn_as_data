<dc:title>Team of oxen</dc:title>
<dc:description>A man with a hat stands next to a team of oxen.  A river and a steamboat can be seen in the background.  The man is standing near some wooden structures, one of which may be a barn.  The name of the steamboat is the "City of Memphis."</dc:description>
<dc:description>Oxen were the predominant work animal in the American South up to the late nineteenth century. Yoked oxen were well-suited for heavy loads - perfect for lifting heavy wagons up muddy river landings. Oxen were heavy-duty, strong, but slow animals. Prior to mules, oxen were often used in agricultural labor. The fact that these workers were still using oxen ca. 1900 is significant.</dc:description>
