<dc:title>River landing with steamboat ramp or gang plank</dc:title>
<dc:description>People gathered at a river landing. Chains and pulleys are suspended from the steamer's boom in order to support the gangplank below. Horses and mules, some with riders, dot the area. In the background there appears town buildings.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Towns often sprang up near rivers. A river was a community's lifeline to the outside world and a vital means of shipping cargo to market. Steamboats carried passengers to faraway ports and often carried mail and news. Incoming boats were a source of great excitement for townspeople.</dc:description>
