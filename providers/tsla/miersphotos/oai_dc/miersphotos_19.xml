<dc:description>The Great Mississippi Flood of 1912 was, at its time, the worst flood on record. North Memphis was badly flooded, as was Lake County, Tennessee. The Wolf River and the Gayoso Bayou overflowed their banks following week after week of rain storms. The cataclysm killed an estimated 1,000 people and displaced 30,000 others. Damage was put at $50 million.</dc:description>
