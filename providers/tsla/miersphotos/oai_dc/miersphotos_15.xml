<dc:title>Man sitting on Texas deck of "City of Memphis"</dc:title>
<dc:description>White-bearded stout man wearing captain's hat sits in a chair on the Texas deck of the steamboat "City of Memphis". The Texas Deck, a long and narrow cabin for officers, was located on a raised section over the skylights of a steamboat. This type of deck was added to many steamboats at the same time Texas became part of the United States.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The "City of Memphis" was built at Jeffersonville, Indiana, in 1898 for the St. Louis &amp; Tennessee River Packet Company. She was placed in the St. Louis and Memphis trade in competition with the "Georgia Lee" a rate war ensued. She then went to the Tennessee River trade until 1910 when bought by Captain Tom Horrissy of Vicksburg, Mississippi, and renamed "S. B. Duncan."  In the St. Louis-Memphis trade she sank, January 1900, while crossing from Rosa Lodge, Arkansas, to Gold Dust, Tennessee.</dc:description>
