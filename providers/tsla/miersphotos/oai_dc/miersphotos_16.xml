<dc:title>Man peeking out of outhouse</dc:title>
<dc:description>Mustachioed man wears captain's hat, glasses, striped bowtie,and a smile as he peers out the window of what appears to be a a one-seater outhouse. He is visible from the chest and shoulders up. The building is of crude construction, built with vertical boards and pentagonal "window".</dc:description>
<dc:description>Outhouses were important aspects of sanitation in rural and urban America. They were typically built away from the house or school and its well or cistern. A water source could be easily contaminated by runoff or waste seeping into the ground. Sears catalogs were a popular presence in outhouses. Elk Falls, Kansas, is considered the outhouse capital of the world.</dc:description>
