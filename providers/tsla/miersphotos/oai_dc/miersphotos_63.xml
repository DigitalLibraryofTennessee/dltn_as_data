<dc:description>Photograph of the Henry Marquand steamboat ferry in service on the Mississippi River.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Henry Marquand Ferry was in service from 1873-1927. It was used as a railroad transfer ferry. She was the Iron Mountain railroad transfer at Cairo for many years. Some sources say that she was operated by the Missouri Pacific Railroad between Birds Point, Missouri and Cairo, Illinois until replaced by the bridge in 1905. Around 1925 she was purchased by boat broker John Klein and was used at Neeley's Landing, Missouri as a loading barge by the Morse Stone and Timber Company. She was dismantled at the Mound City Marine Ways in 1927.</dc:description>
