<dc:title>Women dipping water</dc:title>
<dc:description>Nine women wearing identical bonnets strike a playful pose as they line up to get a dip from a water bucket. They stand closely in single file, and each rests her hands on the next woman's shoulders. An attached pergola shelters a cistern. A child, sucking her thumb, stands nearby watching the women.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Rural folks were often isolated, so they needed to amuse themselves with games and homemade fun. These women appear to be a close-knit group of friends who are hamming it up for the camera. The presence of the cistern is important. According to Merriam-Webster, a cistern is "an artificial reservoir (such as an underground tank) for storing liquids and especially water (such as rainwater)." Many times rainwater was the only water source for a farm family's cooking and bathing.  </dc:description>
