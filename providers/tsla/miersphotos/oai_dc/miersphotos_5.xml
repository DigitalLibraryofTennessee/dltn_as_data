<dc:title>Passengers on deck</dc:title>
<dc:description>Six women and two men, probably passengers, are posing in front of smokestacks on the deck of a steamboat. The Texas deck can be seen at far right in the background. This steamboat is most likely the "City of Memphis." Several of the women are smiling and laughing.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Texas Deck, a long and narrow cabin for officers, was the top deck located under the pilot house. This type of deck was added to many steamboats at the same time Texas became part of the United States.</dc:description>
