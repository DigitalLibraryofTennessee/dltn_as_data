<dc:title>Men standing beneath a shelter at a well</dc:title>
<dc:description>Five men standing under the roof of a crude structure protecting a well; they are filling glass bottles with water. The man at center appears to be holding a dipper. The water is being drawn mechanically by bucket. Two African Americans and a young boy stand in the background.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Throughout history, water wells were a significant aspect of society. Towns and settlements grew up around wells, and were often considered a meeting place for villagers. Numerous literary references to wells can be found in poems, stories, and even in the Bible. </dc:description>
