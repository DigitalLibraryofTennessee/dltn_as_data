<dc:title>Oxen team hauling crossties at tieyard</dc:title>
<dc:description>A team of three yoked oxen stands beside a long row of stacked crossties. Seasonal workers hand-hewed the ties using a broadaxe. The crossties were then delivered to river landing tie yards for steamboat shipment.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Railroad crossties served as a major form of timbering and provided part-time agricultural work well into the 20th century. Ties were collected and shipped at river landing tie yards such as the one depicted here. Oxen were sturdy draft animals used for hauling cargo, plowing fields, and removing tree stumps and rocks.</dc:description>
