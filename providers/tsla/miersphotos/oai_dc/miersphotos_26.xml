<dc:title>A mule-powered ferry boat at river landing</dc:title>
<dc:description>A waterfront view showing three African American men. One man sits at the edge of the river near a mule-powered ferry. The second man is aboard the ferry with two mules. The third man sits on a cliff above the bank. Rocks, driftwood, and a large iron kettle populate the riverbank. Several building structures are pictured in the background above the riverbank.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The typical 19th century ferry boat was powered by horses or mules. In the days before bridges were common, ferries were essential in transporting passengers and goods across rivers. Ferries were indispensable for carrying on commerce up into the 20th century. A horse-powered ferry operated on the Tennessee River into the late 1920s. Ferrymen began using oars, poles, and sweeps instead to guide the boats to the opposite bank.</dc:description>
