<dc:title>Young African American girls</dc:title>
<dc:description>Five African American girls are gathered near a rickety wood fence and wood house. Several of the girls are smiling, though the surrounds suggest they live in dire poverty. They are all wearing plain sack dresses. A white woman wearing a long skirt can be seen in the background. She is walking away.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The humble sack dress was made from seed bags and flour bags. The dresses were standard wear for the poor. Later in the 20th century, print sack dresses were fashionable.</dc:description>
