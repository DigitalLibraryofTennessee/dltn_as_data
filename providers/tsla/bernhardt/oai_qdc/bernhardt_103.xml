<dc:description>In 1823, Jackson along with several of his neighbors donated money to build a neighborhood church.  Jackson also donated the land and possibly slave labor from The Hermitage.  When finished in January 1824, the finished brick building measured fifty by thirty feet.  The church&#8217;s interior featured a brick floor with benches in a semicircle arranged around a pulpit on the building&#8217;s west wall.   Fireplaces on the north and south walls heated this simple rural church. The church became Presbyterian.</dc:description>
