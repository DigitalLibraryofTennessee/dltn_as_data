  <abstract>A portrait of Rachel Jackson as a young woman with a bonnet in her hair. The print was inspired by an image located at the Houston Public Library.</abstract>
  <abstract>Rachel Jackson was the wife of President Andrew Jackson. Their 1791 marriage was later subject to controversy and criticism, as it was discovered that Rachel's first husband, Lewis Robards, had never completed the divorce proceedings. After the Robards' divorce was granted, Rachel and Andrew remarried in 1794. Jackson was always very sensitive to criticism about his wife and her honor.</abstract>
