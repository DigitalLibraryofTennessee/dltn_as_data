  <abstract>The image is of a reddish hue and pictures Independence Hall in Philadelphia. The text indicates that this is where Andrew Jackson represented Tennessee from 1796 to 1798 as Congressman and Senator. The print was inspired by an image from the collection of Mr. Theodore Fred Kuper in New York City. A group of people can be seen from the distance outside of Independence Hall. Individual faces cannot be discerned.</abstract>
  <abstract>Independence Hall was built between 1732 and 1756 to serve as the State House of the Province of Pennsylvania. It was later the meeting place for the Second Continental Congress. Other critical founding documents for the United States were conceived and signed in this building, including the Declaration of Independence.</abstract>
