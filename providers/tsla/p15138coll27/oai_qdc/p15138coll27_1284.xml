<dc:title>Woman Suffrage League (Harriman, Tenn.) Minute Book, 1914-1916</dc:title>
<dc:description>A volume containing minutes for meetings held by the woman suffrage league in Harriman, Tennessee, from 1914 to 1916. Meetings involved election of officers, discussions around affiliation with the state league, and studies and presentations on the U.S. Constitution. Some correspondence, member lists, and accounting notes appear in the volume as well.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history.</dc:description>
