<dc:title>"Remarks of Mr. Williamson"</dc:title>
<dc:description>Mr. Williamson's remarks concerned a proposed bill in the Senate to secure separate property rights for married women. He claimed that this was a harmful measure because it would diminish the husband's assets while still holding him responsible for supporting the family. Additionally, he claimed that granting women property rights meant that they also might get to vote, work in any profession, join the army, or work as sailors.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Beginning in the late 1830s, some state governments began passing legislation that secured the property rights of married women. This was done in order to relieve women of some of the problems they faced under coverture, a legal doctrine in which married women were unable to own property or make contracts in their own name.</dc:description>
