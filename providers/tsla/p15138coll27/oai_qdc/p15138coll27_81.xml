<dc:title>Letter from Governor Albert H. Roberts to Carrie Chapman Catt</dc:title>
<dc:description>Governor Albert H. Roberts wrote that the state Constitution says that "an amendment of the constitution of the United States must be submitted to a General Assembly elected after the submission is made by the Congress. Our General Assembly was elected last November; hence it could not act upon this amendment if called in extra session." The following year, Gov. Roberts called the legislature to a special session to vote upon the 19th Amendment.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Carrie Chapman Catt (1859-1947) was president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). She came to Nashville during the summer of 1920 to support the efforts of Tennessee suffragists. Her leadership was a key factor in Tennessee becoming the "Perfect 36," the state that put the 19th Amendment over the top.</dc:description>
