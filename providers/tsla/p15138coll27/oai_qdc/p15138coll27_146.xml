<dc:title>Letter from Carrie Chapman Catt to Governor Albert H. Roberts</dc:title>
<dc:description>Carrie Chapman Catt, president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), wrote to Governor Roberts to assert that the organization will stand by and work with him in a straightforward manner on the ratification of the 19th Amendment. She expressed her desire for a meeting with Governor Roberts in Nashville. Her letter explained the nature of state auxiliaries within NAWSA, which operated democratically within each state and elected their own officers. NAWSA was strongly non-partisan, and made no effort to curtail the political work of its members. Catt outlined her views of the national Democratic Committee, and her hope that it would send a representative to talk with Tennessee legislators about ratification. "The men who deal with politics, in the National sense, realize what the winning of the thirty-sixth state will do for the party, but this conviction does not necessarily reach the legislator who comes from some remote district in the state." The leaders of the Democratic Party, including President Woodrow Wilson, knew the significance of winning the thirty-sixth state. Since Vermont's governor refused to call a session for ratification, the "opportunity is therefore far more brilliant for Tennessee" to become the pivotal thirty-sixth state to ratify the 19th Amendment.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Albert H. Roberts (1868-1946), served as a single term governor of Tennessee from 1919-1921. Roberts hesitated to call a special session of the General Assembly to consider the ratification of the 19th Amendment, in part because many legislators maintained that voting on the resolution in special session would violate their oath to the Tennessee constitution. Rulings from the Attorney General, and pressure from the national Democratic Party, particularly from President Woodrow Wilson, persuaded Roberts to support the special session and the ratification of the 19th Amendment. Though Roberts won national acclaim for his support of women's suffrage, many conservative Tennesseans were outraged. His support for women's suffrage was one reason for his defeat in the 1920 gubernatorial election by Republican Alfred Taylor.</dc:description>
