<dc:title>"The Red Behind the Yellow: Socialism in the Wake of Suffrage"</dc:title>
<dc:description>An anti-suffrage pamphlet issued by the National Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage. It gives warning that socialists are behind the women's suffrage movement. The cover features an image of marchers at the suffrage parade in Washington, D.C. on March 3, 1913, carrying a banner that reads, "1,000,000 SOCIALISTS WORK AND VOTE FOR WOMAN SUFFRAGE." The First Red Scare reached its height in 1919 and 1920 over the concern that radical politics would aid the spread of communism.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history.</dc:description>
