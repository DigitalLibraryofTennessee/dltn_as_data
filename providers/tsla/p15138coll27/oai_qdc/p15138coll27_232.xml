<dc:title>Gathering of anti-suffragists at Washington Hall</dc:title>
<dc:description>Anti-suffrage leaders including Josephine A. Pearson, the president of the Tennessee Anti-Ratification League, gathered at Washington Hall in Robertson County. Mrs. George A. Washington, the vice-president of the Tennessee Anti-Ratification League hosted a "distinguished gathering of women from various states" and "a number of Judges, Senators, etc." who had traveled from the Hermitage Hotel in Nashville. Washington Hall was destroyed by fire in 1965.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Josephine A. Pearson (1868-1944) was an educator from Monteagle who became president of the Tennessee State Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage and the Southern Women's League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment. She worked tirelessly with various women's groups, religious and political leaders throughout Tennessee in an unsuccessful effort to prevent the passage of women's suffrage.</dc:description>
