<dc:title>Letter from William W. Roberts to Governor Albert H. Roberts</dc:title>
<dc:description>William Roberts wrote, as an "exiled Southerner" living in New York City, to Governor Roberts to express his opposition to "this proposed mischievous 19th Amendment." He asked why a southern state should put its women "not only on the same plane with their cooks and housemaids, but also with the half-naturalized women of New York's East Side." He also noted that the female vote would not help the Democratic party.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Albert H. Roberts (1868-1946), served as a single term governor of Tennessee from 1919-1921. Roberts hesitated to call a special session of the General Assembly to consider the ratification of the 19th Amendment, in part because many legislators maintained that voting on the resolution in special session would violate their oath to the Tennessee constitution. Rulings from the Attorney General, and pressure from the national Democratic Party, particularly from President Woodrow Wilson, persuaded Roberts to support the special session and the ratification of the 19th Amendment. Though Roberts won national acclaim for his support of women's suffrage, many conservative Tennesseans were outraged. His support for women's suffrage was one reason for his defeat in the 1920 gubernatorial election by Republican Alfred Taylor.</dc:description>
