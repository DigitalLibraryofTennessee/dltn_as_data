<dc:title>Excerpt from oral interview with Abby Crawford Milton about the fierce battle in Nashville over the 19th Amendment</dc:title>
<dc:description>Abby Crawford Milton, president of the Tennessee Woman Suffrage Association during the fight for ratification of the 19th Amendment, spoke in 1983 at the age of 101 about the fierce battle that raged in Nashville in the very hot summer of 1920. Milton said that the mezzanine of the Hermitage Hotel had been bought up by the anti-suffragists, who served a lot of liquor at the Hermitage Hotel to legislators in an effort to take away votes. Milton also mentioned that the anti-suffragists showed off the "Woman's Bible," calling it "Mrs. Catt's Bible," noting that twentiy-six preachers and churches in Nashville turned against women's suffrage after seeing the book. Mrs. Catt denied that she was associated with the "Bible" many times, and Milton told her to deny it again. Milton noted that it showed you how hard the anti-suffragists fought that summer. Interview excerpt from Tape 2- 28:10-30:45.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Abby Crawford Milton (1881-1991), a mother of three with a law degree, served as president of the Tennessee Equal Suffrage League during the battle to ratify the 19th Amendment in Tennessee. She gave speeches and helped establish suffrage organizations across the state, and spent August 1920 in Nashville working to convince legislators to vote for women's suffrage. Her husband, George Fort Milton, was the majority owner of the Chattanooga News, a newspaper that supported women's suffrage and was frequently critical of Governor Albert H. Roberts. Abby Crawford Milton became the first president of the League of Women Voters of Tennessee.</dc:description>
