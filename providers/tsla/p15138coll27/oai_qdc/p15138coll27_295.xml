<dc:title>Excerpt from oral interview with Abby Crawford Milton about Harry T. Burn changing his vote in favor of suffrage</dc:title>
<dc:description>Abby Crawford Milton, president of the Tennessee Woman Suffrage Association in 1920, spoke in 1983 at the age of 101 about young Representative Harry T. Burn's role in the ratification of the 19th Amendment. The suffragists lacked several votes in the House of Representatives. Speaker Seth Walker had originally supported suffrage, but had been "persuaded by the opposition" and became the leader of the opposition. Milton said that when Harry Burn changed his vote and broke the deadlock, Speaker Walker came down, put his arm around Harry, and tried to get him to change his vote. "The reason that boy quit voting against us was because his mother had made him promise that if it came to his vote in the final showdown that he would favor the women, and he kept that promise to his mother, and Seth Walker, his friend, couldn't move him, couldn't shake him." Interview excerpt from Tape 2- 35:25-37:47.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Abby Crawford Milton (1881-1991), a mother of three with a law degree, served as president of the Tennessee Equal Suffrage League during the battle to ratify the 19th Amendment in Tennessee. She gave speeches and helped establish suffrage organizations across the state, and spent August 1920 in Nashville working to convince legislators to vote for women's suffrage. Her husband, George Fort Milton, was the majority owner of the Chattanooga News, a newspaper that supported women's suffrage and was frequently critical of Governor Albert H. Roberts. Abby Crawford Milton became the first president of the League of Women Voters of Tennessee.</dc:description>
