<dc:title>Letter from Senator Kenneth Douglas McKellar to State Treasurer Hill McAlister</dc:title>
<dc:description>Senator Kenneth McKellar wrote to State Treasurer Hill McAlister to encourage him to support the proposition that two women from each Congressional District be designated as associate members of the state Democratic Committee. He also stated that Democrats should make the most of woman suffrage and that "our Party could take the lead in this very vital matter."</dc:description>
<dc:description>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Hill McAlister (1875-1959) was an influential Democratic politician from Nashville. He served two terms in the Tennessee State Senate (1911-1915), on the Democratic Executive Committee (1918-1920), as state treasurer (1919-1927), and as governor of Tennessee (1933-1937).</dc:description>
