<dc:title>"Questions for Mrs. Catt"</dc:title>
<dc:description>This two-sided broadside contains the reprint, originally published in both the Nashville Banner and the Chattanooga Times, of an editorial and an article attacking Carrie Chapman Catt. One side contains a letter to Mrs. Catt from Mrs. James S. Pinkard, President of the Southern Women`s League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment. Pinkard asks Catt to explain what she meant by statements such as "American women and men, white and black, should share equally in the privileges of democracy." She states that Tennessee legislators would violate their oaths if they vote to ratify the suffrage amendment, and demands the truth in this matter of "life and death" for the South. The other side reprints an article from The Woman Patriot, an anti-suffrage publication, which asserts that Catt defamed the United States by decrying the treatment of women with claims such as the fact that women cannot vote while aliens, illiterates, drunkards, paupers, criminals and the feeble-minded can vote.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Josephine A. Pearson (1868-1944) was an educator from Monteagle who became president of the Tennessee State Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage and the Southern Women's League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment. She worked tirelessly with various women's groups, religious and political leaders throughout Tennessee in an unsuccessful effort to prevent the passage of women's suffrage.</dc:description>
