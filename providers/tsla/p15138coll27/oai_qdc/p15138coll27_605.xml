<dc:title>Letter from John H. Jessen to Governor Albert H. Roberts</dc:title>
<dc:description>John H. Jessen, of Fort Worth, Texas, wrote to Tennessee Governor Albert H. Roberts on August 22, 1920, expressing his ardent support of the 19th amendment and his disdain for any opposition. Immediately after Tennessee voted in favor of ratification, anti-suffragists began mounting legal challenges to the amendment's constitutionality. One of their arguments was that a proper quorum was not present at the time of ratification.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history.</dc:description>
