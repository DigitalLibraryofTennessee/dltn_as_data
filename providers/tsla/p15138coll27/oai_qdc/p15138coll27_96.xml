<dc:title>Letter from Josephine A. Pearson to Senator A. L. Todd</dc:title>
<dc:description>Josephine A. Pearson, president of the Southern Women's League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment, wrote to A. L. Todd, Speaker of the State Senate of Tennessee, to request a hearing before the General Assembly on the suffrage amendment. She was convinced that suffragists were afraid of public discussion and wished to "smother all hearings rather than have the General Assembly hear BOTH SIDES." She sent a similar letter to Seth Walker, Speaker of the Tennessee House of Representatives.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Josephine A. Pearson (1868-1944) was an educator from Monteagle who became president of the Tennessee State Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage and the Southern Women's League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment. She worked tirelessly with various women's groups, religious and political leaders throughout Tennessee in an unsuccessful effort to prevent the passage of women's suffrage.</dc:description>
