<dc:title>"Legislation in the interest of women and children"</dc:title>
<dc:description>This booklet enumerates the items for which the Tennessee League of Women Voters asked the legislature to support in the interest of women and children. Among the issues are the civil status of women, including property rights of married women; education - including minimum 9 months school terms, minimun salaries and competency requirements for teachers, mandatory physical education, free kindergarten, and the establishment of a vocational school for black girls; women in industry - establishment of a minimum wage and a Department of Labor, the abolishment of the convict lease system, improvement in working hours and conditions for working women, and equal pay for equal work; and additional items related to child welfare, social hygiene, temperance and conservation. It includes a list of the state, district and departmental chairpersons. The organization was called the Tennessee League of Women Voters at the time of publication.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Carrie Chapman Catt (1859-1947) was president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). She came to Nashville during the summer of 1920 to support the efforts of Tennessee suffragists. Her leadership was a key factor in Tennessee becoming the "Perfect 36," the state that put the 19th Amendment over the top.</dc:description>
