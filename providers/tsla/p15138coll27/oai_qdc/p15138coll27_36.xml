<dc:title>"Special session"</dc:title>
<dc:description>This political cartoon shows a harried Colonel Tennessee on a sofa, his hat on the floor, upturned with its brim labeled "Tennessee Legislature"' Two young women sit on either side of the Colonel, vying for his attention. One represents "suffrage" and the other "anti-suffrage." A sign tacked up on the wall behind them says "Special Session," as the legislature of Tennessee was meeting at the time to decide upon the ratification of the 19th Amendment. Henry Romeike, Inc. of New York, NY provided this clipping to Carrie Chapman Catt.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Carrie Chapman Catt (1859-1947) was president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). She came to Nashville during the summer of 1920 to support the efforts of Tennessee suffragists. Her leadership was a key factor in Tennessee becoming the "Perfect 36," the state that put the 19th Amendment over the top.</dc:description>
