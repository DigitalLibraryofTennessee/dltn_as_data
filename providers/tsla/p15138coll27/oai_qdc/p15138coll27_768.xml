<dc:title>"With a String on It!"</dc:title>
<dc:description>A political cartoon with the caption "Suggestion for the Proposed Tennessee Nineteenth Amendment Memorial." It depicts a statue of a woman in patriotic clothing pulling "The Vote" out of a pocket book. The pocket book has a string attached to it, which runs under a dividing wall. On the other side of the wall, a frustrated man labeled "Tennessee" is pulling on the string in an attempt to get the vote back. The statue's pedestal reads, "Erected by the ladies in grateful appreciation of the Ratification of Woman Suffrage."</dc:description>
<dc:description>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history.</dc:description>
