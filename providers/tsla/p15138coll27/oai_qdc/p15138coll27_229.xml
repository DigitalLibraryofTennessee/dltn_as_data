<dc:title>"The woman's protest against woman suffrage"</dc:title>
<dc:description>This undated petition urged the women of Tennessee to sign this petition "for the sake of your State and your sex" against the issue of "Votes-for-women." According to the petition, the great majority of women opposed the ballot as an entrance into "the turmoil of politics as unmixed evils" that would "degrade regard for our sex." The petition cited many reasons for opposing woman suffrage. The work of motherhood was more important than politics. Women trusted their fathers, brothers and husbands to represent them at the ballot box, because their fathers and brothers loved them, they had chosen their husbands, and their sons were "WHAT WE MADE THEM." The petition asserted that the vote wasn't needed and would not be effective for women to achieve reforms. These women believed that women had a higher status and more protection in states where women did not have the right to vote, and that they had more "power for good" if they remained non-partisan and did not vote. They also claimed that the enactment of woman suffrage in Tennessee would increase taxation and add "undesirable, corrupt and job hunting female politicians to the ranks of the male." Finally, in support of their claim that the majority of women do not want the vote, they stated that suffragists opposed a referendum allowing women to vote on the suffrage issue because anti-suffragists had much higher numbers.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Josephine A. Pearson (1868-1944) was an educator from Monteagle who became president of the Tennessee State Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage and the Southern Women's League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment. She worked tirelessly with various women's groups, religious and political leaders throughout Tennessee in an unsuccessful effort to prevent the passage of women's suffrage.</dc:description>
