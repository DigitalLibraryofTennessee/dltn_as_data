<dc:title>Suffrage and the War: a Defense of the South</dc:title>
<dc:description>A booklet written by George R. Lockwood, of the St. Louis Bar, in response to an editorial titled "Suffrage and the War" published in the St. Louis Republic, October 2, 1918. The editorial argues that the United States could not enter peace negotations after World War I as an advocate for democracy when half of its population was disenfranchised. It blames Southern politicians for refusing to grant women's suffrage. Lockwood argues in his booklet that it would be undemocratic for the federal government to violate states' rights and force women's suffrage on the states that do not want it. The booklet includes a political cartoon titled "Woman to the Rescue!" published in the African American periodical The Crisis in May 1916.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history.</dc:description>
