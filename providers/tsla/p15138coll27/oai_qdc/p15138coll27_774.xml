<dc:title>"Votes for Women"</dc:title>
<dc:description>A clipping of the front page of the Nashville Tennessean, Vol. 8, No. 185, November 12, 1914 with the headline: "Suffragists in Session Today." A political cartoon called "The Nation is Listening" features a woman, representing the National American Woman Suffrage Association, whispering about votes for women in the ear of an anthropomorphic United States. A yellow pennant with the words "Votes for Women" spans the top of the page.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history.</dc:description>
