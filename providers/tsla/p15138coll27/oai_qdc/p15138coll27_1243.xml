<dc:title>Suffragettes and suffragettism</dc:title>
<dc:description>Written by a Nashville physician and suffrage opponent after the National American Woman Suffrage Association met in Nashville in 1914, this anti-suffrage pamphlet contains Lyon`s opinions of the suffragettes and his rationalization for limited suffrage and political involvement for women. Among his arguments against woman suffrage are assertions that many women will only vote as men tell them and that universal suffrage will "enfranchies four or five million negresses."</dc:description>
<dc:description>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Josephine A. Pearson (1868-1944) was an educator from Monteagle who became president of the Tennessee State Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage and the Southern Women's League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment. She worked tirelessly with various women's groups, religious and political leaders throughout Tennessee in an unsuccessful effort to prevent the passage of women's suffrage.</dc:description>
