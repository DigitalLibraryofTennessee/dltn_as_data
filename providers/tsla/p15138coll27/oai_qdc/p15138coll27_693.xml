<dc:title>"Suffrage scenes at the Capitol when the Senate ratified Aug. 13"</dc:title>
<dc:description>This special page of The Tennessean featured photographs of both suffrage and anti-suffrage advocates at the Tennessee State Capitol the day the State Senate approved the resolution to ratify the 19th Amendment. Among the pro-suffrage leaders are Anne Dallas (Mrs. Guilford) Dudley, U.S. Senator Kenneth McKellar, Tennessee Speaker of the Senate Andrew L. Todd, Charl Williams and Abby Crawford (Mrs. George Fort) Milton. Anti-suffrage leaders featured included Josephine A. Pearson of Monteagle, Mrs. James A. Pinkard of Montgomery, Alabama and Charlotte Rowe of New York. This item consists of two copies of the same newspaper page. The second copy of the page is missing the upper right corner.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history.</dc:description>
