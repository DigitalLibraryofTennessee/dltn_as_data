<dc:title>"The Vote: First Leaves of Autumn"</dc:title>
<dc:description>Three political cartoons from an unidentified publication. The first features two women, one upper class and one working class, along with the dialogue, "One thing more before I take the job - are you a good Democrat?" The second political cartoon features a man and woman dressed in patriotic garments and identified as Mr. and Mrs. Uncle Sam. The woman's hat is labeled "Woman Suffrage." The third political cartoon features a man in a suit offering cigars to a group of women with the caption: "The old-line political worker who passed out the cigars - how's he going to meet new conditions?"</dc:description>
<dc:description>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history.</dc:description>
