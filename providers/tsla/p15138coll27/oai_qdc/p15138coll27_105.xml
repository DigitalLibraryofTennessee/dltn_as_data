<dc:title>Letter from Carrie Chapman Catt to Governor Albert H. Roberts</dc:title>
<dc:description>Carrie Chapman Catt, the president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association who campaigned for the 19th Amendment in Tennessee, wrote to Governor Roberts after his defeat for re-election for governor in 1920. She noted that Democrats across the country had lost in the Republican landslide, though she was surprised that staunchly Democratic Tennessee had fallen. She expressed her regret that he had suffered for his "righteous act." She said that he had "made a place in history which no man or party can take from you. By an honorable, brave act, your call of the Legislature enfranchised the women of the Nation. Nothing can ever take away the glory of that act, and you know it is our American custom to throw stones at the benefactors of progress and build monuments to them afterwards."</dc:description>
<dc:description>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Carrie Chapman Catt (1859-1947) was president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). She came to Nashville during the summer of 1920 to support the efforts of Tennessee suffragists. Her leadership was a key factor in Tennessee becoming the "Perfect 36," the state that put the 19th Amendment over the top.</dc:description>
