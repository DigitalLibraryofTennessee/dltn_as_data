<dc:title>House Bill 67, 1917</dc:title>
<dc:description>This bill would have granted women in Tennessee the right to vote in presidential, vice-presidential, and municipal elections. It was passed by the House of Representatives on January 19, 1917, but failed to pass the Senate. This legislation was just one of many attempts by Tennessee women to gain the vote at the state level. A typescript of the document is included.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history.</dc:description>
