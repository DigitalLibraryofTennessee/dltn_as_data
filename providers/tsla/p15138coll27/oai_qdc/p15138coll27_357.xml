<dc:title>Willa McCord Blake Eslick (1878-1961)</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of Willa McCord Blake Eslick in 1932. Mrs. Eslick was a prominent suffragist working with the Tennesse Equal Suffrage Association. She was the featured speaker at a banquet for Mrs. Charles Tiffany, board member of the National Equal Suffrage Association, which took place at the Hermitage Hotel (Nashville, Tenn.) on December 2, 1918. Mrs. Eslick was also the first woman to be elected to Congress from the State of Tennessee, filling the vacancy left by her deceased husband, Edward E. Eslick.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history.</dc:description>
