Those who try to circumvent this provision are accused of being lawbreakers who should be impeached, and who are no better than the "BOOTLEGGER and the BOLSHEVIST." The message urges citizens to fight the suffragists' attempts to override the Tennessee constitution by organizing mass meetings and circulating petitions.</dc:description>

Pearson (1868-1944) was an educator from Monteagle who became president of the Tennessee State Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage and the Southern Women's League for the Rejection of the Susan B.
