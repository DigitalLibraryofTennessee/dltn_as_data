<dc:title>Maria Thompson Daviess (1872-1924)</dc:title>
<dc:description>Sketch by artist Sarah Eakin Cowan of Maria Thompson Daviess. Daviess was the vice president of the Nashville Equal Suffrage League in 1911 and worked closely with Anne Dallas Dudley. She was also honorary president of the Tennessee Equal Suffrage Association and was present for the founding of the Madison Equal Suffrage League in 1915.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history.</dc:description>
