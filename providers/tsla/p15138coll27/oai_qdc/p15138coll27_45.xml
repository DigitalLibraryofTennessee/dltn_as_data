<dc:title>"Question is will they get through in time for the presidential election?"</dc:title>
<dc:description>This political cartoon shows Colonel Tennessee spreading tacks along the road traveled by a group of women in a Suffrage Ratification car. The tacks represent "legal technicalities" used by suffrage opponents in an attempt to stop the ratification of the 19th Amendment. Henry Romeike, Inc. of New York, NY provided this clipping to Carrie Chapman Catt.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Carrie Chapman Catt (1859-1947) was president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). She came to Nashville during the summer of 1920 to support the efforts of Tennessee suffragists. Her leadership was a key factor in Tennessee becoming the "Perfect 36," the state that put the 19th Amendment over the top.</dc:description>
