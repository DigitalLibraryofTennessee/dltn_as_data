<dc:title>Telegram from Woodrow Wilson to Speaker W. R. Crabtree</dc:title>
<dc:description>A copy of a telegram from Woodrow Wilson to W. R. Crabtree, Speaker of the Senate in Tennessee, urging him to reconsider legislation extending suffrage to women. In 1917, the Tennessee General Assembly considered a bill that would grant women the right to vote in local and presidential elections. The House of Representatives passed the bill, but the Senate did not. Included is a note from Wilson's Secretary, Joseph Patrick Tumulty, to U.S. Senator Luke Lea.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history.</dc:description>
