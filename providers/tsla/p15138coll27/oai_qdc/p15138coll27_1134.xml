<dc:title>Letter from the Hon. S. C. Johnson to Governor Albert H. Roberts</dc:title>
<dc:description>In this letter, S. C. Johnson informed the governor as a long time Democrat, he drew the line at supporting any candidate who proposed "a law to degrade the womanhood of the South by ratifying the infamous Susan B. Anthony" and at the same time "remanding this country to the tender mercies of negro rule." He asserted that Mrs. [Carrie Chapman] Catt and her fanatics had more influence with the governor than the "best thought of the South." He told the governor that he should retire from the gubernatorial race if he ratifies the amendment, for he would be defeated in the upcoming election. A typed copy of Governor Roberts' response contains his explanation of his action to support the ratification, noting that the Democratic National Convention unanimously adopted a platform calling on Tennessee and other states to ratify the amendment.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Albert H. Roberts (1868-1946), served as a single term governor of Tennessee from 1919-1921. Roberts hesitated to call a special session of the General Assembly to consider the ratification of the 19th Amendment, in part because many legislators maintained that voting on the resolution in special session would violate their oath to the Tennessee constitution. Rulings from the Attorney General, and pressure from the national Democratic Party, particularly from President Woodrow Wilson, persuaded Roberts to support the special session and the ratification of the 19th Amendment. Though Roberts won national acclaim for his support of women's suffrage, many conservative Tennesseans were outraged. His support for women's suffrage was one reason for his defeat in the 1920 gubernatorial election by Republican Alfred Taylor.</dc:description>
