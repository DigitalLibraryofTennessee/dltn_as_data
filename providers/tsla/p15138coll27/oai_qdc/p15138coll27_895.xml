<dc:title>Woman Suffrage - National Suffrage Convention, 1914</dc:title>
<dc:description>Sadie Warner Frazer's typescript reminiscences of the 1914 National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) annual convention that took place in Nashville. Mrs. Frazer was chairman of transportation and gives a humorous account of getting Anna Howard Shaw to her speaking engagement at the Tennessee State Capitol. Frazer recorded her recollections in approximately 1956 or 1957.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history.</dc:description>
