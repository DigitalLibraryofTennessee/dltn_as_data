<dc:title>"Suffrage scenes and leaders"</dc:title>
<dc:description>The Rotogravure Section of the Tennessean featured photographs of suffrage leaders including Carrie Chapman Catt, Elsa McGill, and Kate (Mrs. Leslie) Warner. Politicians such as Governor Albert H. Roberts, Representative Joe Hanover of Memphis, Representative Simpson of Humphreys County, and Representative Harry T. Burn holding a sheaf of congratulatory telegrams in his hand. Burn famously changed his vote for suffrage after receiving a letter from his mother in Niota encouraging him to vote for the 19th Amendment. A photograph of Seth Walker, Speaker of the Tennessee House of Representatives, has been cut from the page.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history.</dc:description>
