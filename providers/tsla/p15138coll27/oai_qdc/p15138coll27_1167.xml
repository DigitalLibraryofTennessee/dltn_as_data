<dc:title>Letter from Mrs. Morgan Brown to the gentlemen of the General Assembly</dc:title>
<dc:description>Mrs. Brown, chairman of the executive committee of the Southern Women's League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment, wrote this letter to the members of the Tennessee General Assembly. She stated that "Seventeen men of honor on the Tennessee Senate and fifty in the House can save Southern civilization and local self government from destruction simply by keeping their solemn oaths to the people and Constitution of Tennessee." In this three-page letter, she claims that suffragists are using underhanded tactics to gain their support because they "dare not trust your judgment and your conscience." She noted that Tennessee was one of only five states that had not acted on the 19th Amendment, and none of the other four - North Carolina, Florida, Connecticut and Vermont - would ratify it. Brown claimed that opposition to women's suffrage was growing stronger every day and that suffragists were "prosecuting the South and asking you to serve as their packed jury." She said that suffragists like Carrie Chapman Catt would not publicly debate the issue and resorted instead to flooding legislators with telegrams from politicians from outside Tennessee. Brown invited the legislators to visits the Anti-Ratification Exhibition at the Hermitage Hotel to see the documents that supported their opposition to the amendment.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Josephine A. Pearson (1868-1944) was an educator from Monteagle who became president of the Tennessee State Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage and the Southern Women's League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment. She worked tirelessly with various women's groups, religious and political leaders throughout Tennessee in an unsuccessful effort to prevent the passage of women's suffrage.</dc:description>
