<dc:title>Draft of a letter from the Tennessee Division of the Southern Women's League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment to the Tennessee General Assembly</dc:title>
<dc:description>This letter may have been a draft congratulatory message to the General Assembly to be sent after the defeat of ratification of the 19th Amendment. It calls the legislators "champions of our beloved Tennessee's States Rights in our united fight for honor, integrity and constitutional protection." Furthermore, "you have been brave and fearless to strike the key note of an independent manhood that refuses to be effeminized" and stood against powers that overstepped in trying to force them to accept the ignoble legislation. Listed as signers of the letter are Miss Josephine A. Pearson, Mrs. Geo. A. Washington, Mrs. Morgan Brown, Miss Josephine Farrell and Mrs. C. C. Gilbert.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Josephine A. Pearson (1868-1944) was an educator from Monteagle who became president of the Tennessee State Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage and the Southern Women's League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment. She worked tirelessly with various women's groups, religious and political leaders throughout Tennessee in an unsuccessful effort to prevent the passage of women's suffrage.</dc:description>
