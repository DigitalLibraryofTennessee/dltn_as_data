  <abstract>Writing as the president of the Southern Women's League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment, Pearson encouraged Tennesseans to contact their legislators to state their belief that the legislators must uphold their oath to the state constitution. "The fate of white civilization in the South may hang on a few votes either way, and YOUR action may be the deciding influence with YOUR representative in this great battle for State Rights, Honor and the safety of Southern civilization." A handwritten note on the back states that thousands of these letters were sent.</abstract>
  <abstract>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Josephine A. Pearson (1868-1944) was an educator from Monteagle who became president of the Tennessee State Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage and the Southern Women's League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment. She worked tirelessly with various women's groups, religious and political leaders throughout Tennessee in an unsuccessful effort to prevent the passage of women's suffrage.</abstract>
