  <abstract>A political cartoon in two panels. The first panel bears the caption "Of the home, by the home, for the home" and shows three women casting their ballots. The second panel bears the caption "Of the boss, by the boss, for the boss and his paymasters" and shows three men casting their ballots while another man watches them.</abstract>
  <abstract>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history.</abstract>
