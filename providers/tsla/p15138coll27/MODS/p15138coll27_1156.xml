  <abstract>Abby Crawford Milton, president of the Tennessee Woman Suffrage Association, wrote to invite the governor to the opening session of the first convention of the Tennessee Women Voters League. She worried that women may face injunctions when they vote in county or presidential elections, as granted by the Tennessee legislature in 1919, without a poll tax receipt. If they wait to address the issue until the ratification of the 19th Amendment, it could complicate the ability of women to vote in the August primaries. Milton included a flyer encouraging Tennessee women to participate in the Women Voters' Convention, where women would make an "intensive study of citizenship" and promote better legislation. Listed on the flyer are leaders of the Tennessee Woman Suffrage Association, The Parent-Teachers Association, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, the Tennessee Federation of Music Clubs, the Daughters of the American Revolution and the Tennessee Press and Authors Club. In Governor Roberts' response, he thanked her for her letter and acknowledged the possible danger to the Democratic Party during the national election because of the failure to impose a poll tax on women. However, he did not want to call a special session for the issue, and then soon after need to call a second special session to ratify the 19th Amendment. He invited her to communicate further on the subject.</abstract>
  <abstract>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Albert H. Roberts (1868-1946), served as a single term governor of Tennessee from 1919-1921. Roberts hesitated to call a special session of the General Assembly to consider the ratification of the 19th Amendment, in part because many legislators maintained that voting on the resolution in special session would violate their oath to the Tennessee constitution. Rulings from the Attorney General, and pressure from the national Democratic Party, particularly from President Woodrow Wilson, persuaded Roberts to support the special session and the ratification of the 19th Amendment. Though Roberts won national acclaim for his support of women's suffrage, many conservative Tennesseans were outraged. His support for women's suffrage was one reason for his defeat in the 1920 gubernatorial election by Republican Alfred Taylor.</abstract>
