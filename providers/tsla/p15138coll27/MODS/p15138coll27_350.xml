  <abstract>A 1915 cartoon by W. E. Hill as it appeared in "The Gracious Road to Battle" by Louise Davis in the Nashville Tennessean, January 11, 1948. The cartoon features a young woman standing before a crowd of men, wearing a "Votes for Women" sash and carrying a box with "Freedom" written on it. An older man in a top hat faces the reader with a look of shock and concern on his face. The caption reads: "And he thought she was 'just a little girl.'"</abstract>
  <abstract>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history.</abstract>
