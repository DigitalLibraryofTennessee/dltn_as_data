  <abstract>Colonel Luke Lea, president of the Nashville Tennessean, wrote to Carrie Chapman Catt to inform her he was not the best person to influence four members of the Tennessee House of Representatives that Governor Albert H. Roberts said that he could sway to support the suffrage amendment. Lea resented this "bungling piece of stupidity, inspired by spite, on the part of the Governor," and assured Catt that he had found someone else to speak with those representatives, and that the success of her cause was "near to his heart."</abstract>
  <abstract>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Carrie Chapman Catt (1859-1947) was president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). She came to Nashville during the summer of 1920 to support the efforts of Tennessee suffragists. Her leadership was a key factor in Tennessee becoming the "Perfect 36," the state that put the 19th Amendment over the top.</abstract>
