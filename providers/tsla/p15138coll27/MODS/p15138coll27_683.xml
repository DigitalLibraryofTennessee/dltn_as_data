  <abstract>In this essay on women's rights, Isabel Elliott Howell argues against suffragists and claims that women exercise their authority and influence in the domestic sphere. She upholds Florence Nightingale as an example for all women because of her service in the Crimean War.</abstract>
  <abstract>Women's rights and the question of female suffrage remained topics of intense debate following the 1848 convention at Seneca Falls. Many women penned essays, books, and articles arguing both for and against women's suffrage. Several well-educated women established anti-suffrage organizations, such as the National Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage. Such organizations argued that suffrage interfered with familiy institutions and that motherhood should be the highest duty of women. Isabel Elliott Howell was an educated woman from the prominent Howell family of Tennessee and Virginia.</abstract>
