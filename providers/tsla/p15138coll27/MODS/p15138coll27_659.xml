  <abstract>The women of Marshall County petitioned against the repeal of anti-liquor laws targeting tippling houses in the state of Tennessee.</abstract>
  <abstract>Although women could not vote before the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, they still participated in local politics through petitions and took part in reform movements. Women played a significant role in the temperance movement, and established influential national organizations such as the Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). During the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the WCTU also became a vehicle for advocating women's suffrage. Those in the temperance movement frequently petitioned for laws limiting, if not prohibiting, the sale of liquor. Tippling houses, establishments where alcohol was sold in small quantities to be consumed on the premises, were frequently targeted by temperance advocates.</abstract>
