  <abstract>This act granted Tennessee women the right to vote in presidential and municipal elections. It also granted women the right to participate and vote in certain matters and elections and prescribed the qualifications and conditions under which women could exercise these rights of suffrage. In order to vote, women had to be at least 21 years of age, a citizen of the United States who had resided in Tennessee for at least a year, and within their present county for at least six months preceding an election. They were required to register to vote in the same manner as male voters. If male voters were required to provide evidence of the payment of a poll tax, then women voters would be required to furnish evidence of payment also. House Bill 717 was passed by the legislature on April 14, 1919 and signed by Seth Walker, Speaker of the House of Representatives and Andrew L. Todd, Speaker of the Senate on April 15, 1919. It was signed by Governor A. H. Roberts on April 17, 1919 after which Ike B. Stevens, Tennessee Secretary of State, filed and assigned its chapter number. It was the first major victory for Tennessee suffragists.</abstract>
  <abstract>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history.</abstract>
