  <abstract>A photograph of Mrs. Mary Giles Howard, President of the Woman's Club of Chattanooga, featured in the April 29, 1916 issue of The Lookout, the official publication of the Tennessee Federation of Women's Clubs. Mrs. Howard was the second vice chairman of the Tennessee Division of Alice Paul's Congressional Union in 1916, which would later become the National Woman's Party. She also served on the Republican National Committee from 1924-1929 and ran for U.S. Representative in 1924.</abstract>
  <abstract>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history.</abstract>
