  <abstract>In this letter to his mother on New Year's Day, 1919, Thomas Tracey acknowledges the impact she has had on him and adds the following poem on the subject of women's suffrage: "Glory to God in the highest!/Let Satan and his imps/be caged with the Hun's/Give mother's the ballot and/a world's peace will come."</abstract>
  <abstract>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history.</abstract>
