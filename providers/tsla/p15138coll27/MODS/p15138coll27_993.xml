  <abstract>Kate (Mrs. Leslie) Warner, president of the Tennessee Woman Suffrage Association, wrote to Governor Albert H. Roberts to decry the picketing tactics used by more militant suffragists. She enclosed two articles. In the first, Warner pointed out that the Tennessee Woman Suffrage Association, headed nationally by Carrie Chapman Catt, was different than the "Militant or Woman's Party" of which Alice Paul was the president. She did not want her organization to be held responsible for the actions of the more militant group. The second article reported that Joy Young, a representative of the National Woman's Party, planned to remain in Tennessee, despite the "repudiation" by Mrs. Warner. The article contains a lengthy quote from Sue Shelton White of Jackson, Tennessee, explaining her decision to decline an invitation from Tennessee Woman Suffrage Association and to work with the National Woman's Party instead. White stated that she maintained her good standing with the national association and Carrie Chapman Catt, and hoped that Warner and Nashville suffragists would "turn their guns on the opponents of suffrage, rather than upon other suffragists." Governor Roberts replied to tell her that he appreciated her sensible attitude. He stated that the picketing suffragists "by their folly" were delaying the coming of women's suffrage more than any other influences.</abstract>
  <abstract>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Albert H. Roberts (1868-1946), served as a single term governor of Tennessee from 1919-1921. Roberts hesitated to call a special session of the General Assembly to consider the ratification of the 19th Amendment, in part because many legislators maintained that voting on the resolution in special session would violate their oath to the Tennessee constitution. Rulings from the Attorney General, and pressure from the national Democratic Party, particularly from President Woodrow Wilson, persuaded Roberts to support the special session and the ratification of the 19th Amendment. Though Roberts won national acclaim for his support of women's suffrage, many conservative Tennesseans were outraged. His support for women's suffrage was one reason for his defeat in the 1920 gubernatorial election by Republican Alfred Taylor.</abstract>
