  <abstract>Abby Crawford Milton, president of the Tennessee Woman Suffrage Association, wrote to invite Governor Roberts to the Suffrage Jubille Convention (called the Women Voter's Convention in a later letter). She listed the measures that she would like to see addressed in the call for an extra session of the legislature. These included a mother's pension, equal guardianship by both parents of the persons and property of children, a law removing restrictions from women holding office, and social hygiene laws. She asserted her confidence that the governor had considered whether additional legislation was needed before women voted in the upcoming primary elections, and thanked him for his aid in their work for child welfare. Governor Roberts stated in his response on March 23 that it would be important to consider legal questions prior to the extra session, if it were called: "The questions involved are too important and the rights of the people are too sacred for us to do anything in haste or imperfectly." He added that it might be possible to consider some of the issues she raised in an extra session, but not all of them due to the limitations of time.</abstract>
  <abstract>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Albert H. Roberts (1868-1946), served as a single term governor of Tennessee from 1919-1921. Roberts hesitated to call a special session of the General Assembly to consider the ratification of the 19th Amendment, in part because many legislators maintained that voting on the resolution in special session would violate their oath to the Tennessee constitution. Rulings from the Attorney General, and pressure from the national Democratic Party, particularly from President Woodrow Wilson, persuaded Roberts to support the special session and the ratification of the 19th Amendment. Though Roberts won national acclaim for his support of women's suffrage, many conservative Tennesseans were outraged. His support for women's suffrage was one reason for his defeat in the 1920 gubernatorial election by Republican Alfred Taylor.</abstract>
