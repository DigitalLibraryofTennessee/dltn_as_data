  <abstract>E. H. Crump, chairman of the Democratic State Executive Committee and County Trustee of Shelby County wrote to State Treasurer Hill McAlister about the recent election which he felt would make the state legislature "strongly Democratic as usual." He strongly believed that women not paying a poll tax hurt the Democratic party, because "so many of them in East Tennessee and negro women in other sections of the state carried Tennessee into the Harding column. I was never so certain in all my life as I was that with woman suffrage and no poll tax provision, it would be harmful to the Democratic party."</abstract>
  <abstract>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Hill McAlister (1875-1959) was an influential Democratic politician from Nashville. He served two terms in the Tennessee State Senate (1911-1915), on the Democratic Executive Committee (1918-1920), as state treasurer (1919-1927), and as governor of Tennessee (1933-1937).</abstract>
