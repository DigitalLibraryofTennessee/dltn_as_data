  <abstract>This pamphlet contains two articles by J. C. McQuiddy, editor of the Gospel Advocate, criticizing women's suffrage from a religious perspective. The first article specifically references The Woman's Bible, a book by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and a committee of women including Carrie Chapman Catt, that argued against the religious orthodoxy of woman's subservience to man. The two articles were circulated by the Tennessee Division of the Southern Women's League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment in 1920.</abstract>
  <abstract>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history.</abstract>
