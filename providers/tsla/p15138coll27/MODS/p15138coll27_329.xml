  <abstract>Josephine A. Pearson, the president of the Tennessee State Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage, wrote to Governor Roberts after the passage of the equal suffrage bill in Tennessee which granted women the right to vote in municipal and federal elections. She pleaded with the governor to repeal the legislation, and said that she had written to some state senators who "represent something of the chivalry of the old South" in the hope that "Southern manhood has not yet become Effeminized!" She stated that she had refused to join the political fight as the suffragists had, leaving that to the men of the state. Pearson stated that she would "rather go down in glorious defeat than feel that I led the women of my native state to soil the escutcheon of Southern womanhood in the 'mire of politics'!"</abstract>
  <abstract>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Albert H. Roberts (1868-1946), served as a single term governor of Tennessee from 1919-1921. Roberts hesitated to call a special session of the General Assembly to consider the ratification of the 19th Amendment, in part because many legislators maintained that voting on the resolution in special session would violate their oath to the Tennessee constitution. Rulings from the Attorney General, and pressure from the national Democratic Party, particularly from President Woodrow Wilson, persuaded Roberts to support the special session and the ratification of the 19th Amendment. Though Roberts won national acclaim for his support of women's suffrage, many conservative Tennesseans were outraged. His support for women's suffrage was one reason for his defeat in the 1920 gubernatorial election by Republican Alfred Taylor.</abstract>
