  <abstract>A volume containing minutes for meetings held by the woman suffrage league in Nashville, Tennessee, from 1918 to 1919. Meetings involved election of officers, reports from the various wards, funding concerns, and war work. Of particular interest are comments made concerning the Woman's Party and its picketers.</abstract>
  <abstract>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history.</abstract>
