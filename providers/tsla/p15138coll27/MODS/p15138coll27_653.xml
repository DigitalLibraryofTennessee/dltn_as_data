  <abstract>This anti-suffrage article from the The Lookout, a "Journal of Southern Society" published in Chattanooga, contains a vivid description of events in Nashville during the special session of the legislature that ratified the 19th Amendment. It describes the pandemonium in the capital, and chronicles activities of both politicians and the socially prominent women involved in the struggle."The Battle of the Roses waged day and night on the Battle Ground, which was practically all over the Hermitage Hotel and the State Capital." It highlights the controversy surrounding the "Woman's Bible," the questionable antics of suffragists to win votes, and the pressures applied to young Harry T. Burn to change his vote in favor of suffrage, quoting an anti-suffragist who called him "the Benedict Arnold of the South." Another anti-suffragist reportedly said, "Tennessee is being made a Catt's paw," a reference to national suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt. Since the serious issues had been covered by newspaper agencies from all over the country, this article added descriptions of humorous incidents, such as an anti-suffrage legislator who cut off his tie to escape an overly ardent young suffragist. The last page contains information about the travels of prominent citizens, and indicates that suffragist Abby Crawford Milton and her family had returned from Nashville. It also mentions that Sarah (Mrs. Harry) Wise, author of this letter [see also image 42515] to Josephine A. Pearson, had returned from Nashville "where she joined Anti-Ratification forces."</abstract>
  <abstract>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Josephine A. Pearson (1868-1944) was an educator from Monteagle who became president of the Tennessee State Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage and the Southern Women's League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment. She worked tirelessly with various women's groups, religious and political leaders throughout Tennessee in an unsuccessful effort to prevent the passage of women's suffrage.</abstract>
