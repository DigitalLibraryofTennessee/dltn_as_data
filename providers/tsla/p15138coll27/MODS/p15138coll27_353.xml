  <abstract>A photograph of Mrs. Newell Sanders, President of the Lookout Mountain Beautiful Club, featured in the April 29, 1916 issue of The Lookout, the official publication of the Tennessee Federation of Women's Clubs. Mrs. Sanders was a suffragist, a national leader in the League of Women voters, and the first woman in the South to vote. She cast her historic ballot in a 1918 municipal election in Lookout Mountain, which had just passed local women's suffrage the previous year.</abstract>
  <abstract>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history.</abstract>
