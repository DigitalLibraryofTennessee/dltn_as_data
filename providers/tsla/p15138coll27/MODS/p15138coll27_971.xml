  <abstract>A pamphlet written by John J. Vertrees in 1916 in Nashville, Tennessee. Mr. Vertrees was a local attorney and strong opponent of suffrage. After the Tennessee legislature passed ratification of the 19th amendment, he filed a case against the State of Tennessee, challenging the constitutionality of the new law. The Tennessee Supreme Court docket for that trial is also a part of this collection.</abstract>
  <abstract>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Race featured heavily in the suffrage debate. Much of the argument against women's suffrage centered on the fear of a potential rise in black voters. Some suffrage proponents also exploited this fear by arguing that passage of the 19th amendment would increase the number of white voters overall.</abstract>
