  <abstract>After Mrs. Katherine (Leslie) Warner shared a letter from Carrie Chapman Catt with Governor Albert H. Roberts, he wrote to Catt to explain his opinion of the complicated political situation in Tennessee. He warned that those "now assuming the act for your movement are antagonistic to me" and that the 19th Amendment would not be ratified in Tennessee without his support. Abby Crawford Milton, the leader of the non-partisan League of Women Voters, was the wife of George Fort Milton, the owner of a daily newspaper that maliciously "daily misrepresents" him for political reasons, and thus, would not be the best choice to lead the suffrage movement in Tennessee. Roberts noted that Mrs. (Catherine Talty) Kenny was the appointee of Mrs. Milton and will do her bidding. His friends would not support the suffrage movement if it is to be used as an instrument of his political destruction. On the other hand, Mrs. Warner was a "pioneer Suffragist" and "a lady of culture and refinement" who enjoyed "the confidence of all of the Democrats of the State." Katherine Warner had served as the first president of the Tennessee Woman Suffrage Association, and was Roberts' choice to lead his appointed Ratification Committee. In contrast, Mrs. Milton's organization had little strength in the state. Since they had been asked to ratifiy the suffrage amendment with the argument that it would help the party, it made no sense to turn the movement over to a non-partisan organization. The State Democratic Committee would officially endorse Mrs. Warner's suffrage organization, and he trusted that he would "not be compelled to antagonize your organization in this fight." He closed by stating that the letter was in strict confidence, and not for publication.</abstract>
  <abstract>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Carrie Chapman Catt (1859-1947) was president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). She came to Nashville during the summer of 1920 to support the efforts of Tennessee suffragists. Her leadership was a key factor in Tennessee becoming the "Perfect 36," the state that put the 19th Amendment over the top.</abstract>
