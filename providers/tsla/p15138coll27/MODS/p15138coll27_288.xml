  <abstract>This article describes the final phase of the struggle for women`s suffrage, outlining the unsuccessful injunction against ratification in Tennessee, as well as the celebration in Washington following the official federal ratification. It names many of the women, such as Carrie Chapman Catt and Anne Dallas Dudley, who worked in Tennessee for the ratification of the 19th Amendment. The article contains two maps of the United States. The first is "The Suffrage Map in Early August, 1920," showing states which allowed women full suffrage, limited suffrage such as for primaries, or presidential or municipal elections, or no suffrage at all. The second shows "What Tennessee Did to the Suffrage Map," which was to grant full suffrage throughout the country.</abstract>
  <abstract>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Carrie Chapman Catt (1859-1947) was president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). She came to Nashville during the summer of 1920 to support the efforts of Tennessee suffragists. Her leadership was a key factor in Tennessee becoming the "Perfect 36," the state that put the 19th Amendment over the top.</abstract>
