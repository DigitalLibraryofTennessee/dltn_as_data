  <abstract>Photo from scrapbook with caption that reads: "Front or Outer office of Anti-Ratification Headquarters, Hotel Hermitage, Mrs. Morgan Brown, Executive Chairman, standing at the Entrance. Seated [are] many prominent Nashville women, who faithfully served their state in detachments, day and night, during August 1920. Standing in the rear at the Entrance to the inner office of the President and Vice-President, Miss Josephine A. Pearson and Mrs. George A. Washington, respectively; is Mrs. Jas. Pinkard, President General of the Southern Women's League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment. To her right, in the center, is Miss Charlotte Raine, field Speaker of the National Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage; near her to the right, is Mrs. Aspy of Boston, Field Organizer of the National Association."</abstract>
  <abstract>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Josephine A. Pearson (1868-1944) was an educator from Monteagle who became president of the Tennessee State Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage and the Southern Women's League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment. She worked tirelessly with various women's groups, religious and political leaders throughout Tennessee in an unsuccessful effort to prevent the passage of women's suffrage.</abstract>
