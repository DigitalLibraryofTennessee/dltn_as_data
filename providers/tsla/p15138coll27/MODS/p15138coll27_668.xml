  <abstract>The women of Cannon County, Tennessee petition the state legislature to pass anti-liquor laws. Notably, the petitioners assure the legislature that they, as women, have no intention of participating in politics or dictating the actions of the state government. Instead, they state that they felt their grievances needed to be heard.</abstract>
  <abstract>Although women could not vote before the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, they still participated in local politics through petitions and took part in reform movements. Women played a significant role in the temperance movement, and established influential national organizations such as the Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). During the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the WCTU also became a vehicle for advocating women's suffrage. Those in the temperance movement frequently petitioned for laws limiting, if not prohibiting, the sale of liquor.</abstract>
