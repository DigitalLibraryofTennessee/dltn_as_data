  <abstract>Leona Catherine Holladay gave this address during the graduation ceremony at an all-female school in 1867. She states that women must remain in their proper sphere in order to create a harmonious society. Although she attacks men who treat women as servants rather than companions, she labels suffragists as "false friends" and argues that females need to remain separated from politics.</abstract>
  <abstract>Women's rights and the question of female suffrage remained topics of intense debate following the 1848 convention at Seneca Falls. Many women penned essays, books, and articles arguing both for and against women's suffrage. Several well-educated women established anti-suffrage organizations, such as the National Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage. Such organizations argued that suffrage interfered with familiy institutions and that motherhood should be the highest duty of women.</abstract>
