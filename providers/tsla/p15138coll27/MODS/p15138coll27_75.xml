  <abstract>Harry T. Burn was a Republican member of the Tennessee House of Representatives from Niota, in McMinn County. Elected at the age of twenty-two, he became the youngest member of the state legislature. Burn voted with anti-suffragists on a motion to table the ratification resolution for the 19th Amendment that would grant women the right to vote. That vote resulted in a 48-48 tie. When the roll call vote came on the amendment, Harry T. Burn heeded the plea in a letter from his mother, encouraging him to support ratification, and voted yes, effectively breaking the tie. Speaker Seth Walker also changed his vote, planning a parliamentary maneuver to enable the House to reconsider the resolution. Burn's vote provided a 49th vote, and Walker's gave the amendment its 50th vote and the constitutional majority needed for ratification.</abstract>
  <abstract>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history.</abstract>
