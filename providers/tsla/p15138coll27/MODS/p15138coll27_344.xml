  <abstract>A political cartoon by T. E. Powers published in the Commercial Appeal on February 25, 1908. It bears the caption "A Political Parade - Not Yet, but Soon" and features women marching with signs such as: "Take the Duty Off Paris Gowns," "We Demand Five Bargain Days a Week," and "More Mirrors on the Subway." It also depicts onlookers' attitudes toward the marching women with many of them commenting on the women's absence from home and their neglect of domestic responsibilities.</abstract>
  <abstract>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history.</abstract>
