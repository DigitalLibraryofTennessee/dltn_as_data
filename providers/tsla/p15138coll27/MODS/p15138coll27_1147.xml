  <abstract>Tennessee Supreme Court case arguing whether women, who have just been granted the right to vote, must pay poll taxes (as men must) before being permitted to vote. The two women who have brought the case are Katherine T. Kenny and Caroline G. Kimbrough. Only a portion of the case was digitized; more materials are available under this case name in our Tennessee Supreme Court records.</abstract>
  <abstract>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history.</abstract>
