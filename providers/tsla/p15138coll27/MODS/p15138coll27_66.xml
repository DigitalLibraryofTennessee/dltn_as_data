  <abstract>Anti-suffrage activists created this broadside from an article by James Callaway printed in Georgia's Macon Telegraph to defend the reputation of General Robert E. Lee, and to demonstrate the malicious nature of suffrage propaganda. Calloway and many southerners believed that Susan B. Anthony and those who compiled the "Official History of Suffrage" had slandered Lee by claiming that he had driven his daughter, Anna Carter Lee, from home because she supported the "national cause." Callaway included a letter from Mary Custis Lee, the only surviving daughter, to refute the story. Mary wrote that Annie died of typhoid fever in 1862 in North Carolina, in the arms of her mother. She had never been driven from her home by her father. Callaway stated that "the compilers saw fit for political purposes to fabricate visious slander against General Lee and his family."</abstract>
  <abstract>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Josephine A. Pearson (1868-1944) was an educator from Monteagle who became president of the Tennessee State Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage and the Southern Women's League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment. She worked tirelessly with various women's groups, religious and political leaders throughout Tennessee in an unsuccessful effort to prevent the passage of women's suffrage.</abstract>
