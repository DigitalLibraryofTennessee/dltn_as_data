  <abstract>A program for a music recital featuring Kitty Cheatham presented by the Nashville Business Woman's Equal Suffrage League on June 29, 1915 at the George Peabody College for Teachers. Suffragists worked to increase public support for their cause through a variety of social events, such as recitals, pageants, parades, and barbecues. Katherine "Kitty" Cheatham (1864-1946) was a world-renown singer born and raised in Nashville, Tennessee.</abstract>
  <abstract>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history.</abstract>
