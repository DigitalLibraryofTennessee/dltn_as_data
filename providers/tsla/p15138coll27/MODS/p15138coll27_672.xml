  <abstract>The women of Fayette County, Tennessee petitioned for protections and securities on the property owned by women before marriage. They argued that it was unjust for husbands to be able to take or sell their wives' property, granted to them by their fathers, and that it left women and children financially vulnerable.</abstract>
  <abstract>Beginning in the late 1830s, some state governments began passing legislation that secured the property rights of married women. This was done in order to relieve women of some of the problems they faced under coverture, a legal doctrine in which married women were unable to own property or make contracts in their own name.</abstract>
