<dc:description>Germans taken prisoner by the Americans during the drive on the Hindenburg Line at Bellicourt and the Canal St. de Quentin march along a road under guard.  The background of the image features buildings which have sustained heavy war damage.  Allied troops lead the prisoners of war along the road, but they also litter the route as bystanders of the march.  Military vehicles are passing this scene on the opposite side of the street.</dc:description>
