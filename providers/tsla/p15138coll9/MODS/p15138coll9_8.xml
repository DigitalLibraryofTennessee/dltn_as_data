    <identifier>Head-Quarters Department of the Cumberland, Office of Chief Engineer Chattanooga Tenn. June 20th 1864 Circular To officers Comdg. Troops doing duty as Engineers or Pioneers. The act of Congress lately passed authorizing the raising of an Engineer regiment permits the enlistment of all men who are or have been doing duty as Engineers, Pontoniers, or Pioneers. The original act sent to Washington was drafted by me and limited the men to be enlisted to present and former members of the Pioneeer Brigade. The act as passed was re-written in Washington and was not seen by me until after it had passed both houses and became a law. It would be manifestly unjust to insist upon the use of the full authority conferred by the law and therefore I have instructed all recruiting officers to decline enlisting any men from the Michigan Engineers, the 58th Indiana, or the Engineer Brigade who are not ex-Pioneers. As it would be legal, however, to do so I have authorized them to enlist other than ex-Pioneers on the written consent of regimental commanders. Wm E. Herrill Capt. &amp; Chief Engn Colonel Buell 58th Mo Vols</identifier>

    <abstract>The images found in this section have been gathered from various manuscript collections and offer a glimpse at the wide variety of material available at the Tennessee State Library and Archives that may be of interest to those researching Civil War history and genealogy.  These images illustrate the extensive recordkeeping system at work during the Civil War and demonstrate the complex organizational structure needed to handle the massive accumulation of records.  From transportation orders to quartermaster records, these items not only provide insight into the soldiersâ€™ lives, they also illustrate the costs of war and sacrifices that were made from all facets of society on both the Confederate and Federal sides...</abstract>
