    <identifier>Statement to accompany Return of Ordnance and Ordnance Stores under charge of Capt. W. A. Wainwright A. Q. M. for Company “F” 7th Regiment of Quartermasters Forces Nashville Tenn. For the 2nd Quarter ending June 30th 1865. The Ordnance Property taken up on this Return was “unserviceable” &amp; Dropped was rendered unserviceable from no neglect of those having it in charge-during the battle with Hood at Nashville on the 15th-16th-17th &amp; 18th Dec. 1864. The Muskets &amp; Accoutrements were old &amp; much worn when first Received and as the “Quartermaster’s Forces” were ordered out with both arms and intrenching tools. The Arms and Ammunition were unavoidably damaged by the wet weather while the Forces were hurriedly throwing up intrenchments. The 3000 Cartridges received from Capt. C. H. Irvin A. Q. M. as per Invoice dated Dec. 20th 1864 were invoiced as B. &amp; B. Cal. Cg – But on examination were found to be only 1000 B. &amp; B. Cal. Cg. &amp; the other 2000 were E. B. Cartridges Cal. 574 and as such are taken up and dropped on Return. I certify the above Statement to be Correct. W. A. Wainright Capt. A. Q. M.</identifier>
