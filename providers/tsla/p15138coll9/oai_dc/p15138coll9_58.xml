<dc:description>The term "muster roll" often calls to mind Civil War company muster rolls, but an initial muster-in roll for an individual soldier, such as this one, is quite illustrative. The directions to the mustering officer printed at the bottom of the form highlight the multiple copies that were produced of Civil War official military forms.  In this case, four copies were to be made and sent to the appropriate entities on national and state levels to ensure proper recording of enrollment and payment.</dc:description>
