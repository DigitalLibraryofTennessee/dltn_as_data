<dc:description>The return of quartermaster stores report was one of the four required quarterly reports that had to be turned in within twenty days of the end of the quarter.  Quarterly returns were more comprehensive than monthly reports and required vouchers and abstracts, such as this one, for support.  The return of quartermaster stores report was the main summary document for non-financial transactions during the Civil War.</dc:description>
