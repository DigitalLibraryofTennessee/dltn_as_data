<dc:description>The U. S. Army relied heavily on impressed goods while on campaign.  While the Quartermaster furnished rations and other goods for the army, many items, such as horses, mules, wood, and animal feed, were often taken from local populations. The U. S. government promised to reimburse individuals for impressed items through January 1, 1880, after which no further claims would be accepted.</dc:description>
