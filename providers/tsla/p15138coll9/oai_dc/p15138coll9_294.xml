<dc:description>During the Civil War federal officials recognized a need for new laws to deal with rebellious acts of members of the Southern population. Because treason seemed too strong an offense, and death too severe a penalty for many of the acts in support of the Confederate cause, the Congress passed acts of July 31, 1861, and July 17, 1862, that fixed penalties for the lesser crimes of conspiracy and rebellion. The latter act also provided for future pardon and amnesty.</dc:description>
