<dc:description>Double-sided, one-page printed Form No. 4 contains handwritten information about the soldier's service, his description, and any pay or compensation that is due to him upon his discharge from service. This certificate of accounts also functions as a payment voucher.  A Justice of the Peace affidavit appears on back of document attesting to the soldier's inability to procure proper paperwork to be presented upon discharge.</dc:description>

<dc:description>At the time of an enlisted man's discharge from service, his company commander would ordinarily furnish him with his certificate of accounts.  In this case, Bolton's information has been filed in duplicate at Dalton Hospital in Georgia, probably the place where he was treated and obtained the surgeon's certificate.   His post commander signs for him, rather than his company commander, indicating why he cannot furnish a descriptive roll or a final statement upon discharge.</dc:description>
