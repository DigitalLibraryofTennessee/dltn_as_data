<dc:description>General orders are published directives issued by a commander, binding upon all personnel under his command, to affect policies or procedures unique to a unit's situation not addressed by service regulations. General orders have the force of law within a unit.  This order was issued as a congratulatory report of the victory at Hartsville, but an official change in the color standards of a unit also requires the issuance of an order.</dc:description>
