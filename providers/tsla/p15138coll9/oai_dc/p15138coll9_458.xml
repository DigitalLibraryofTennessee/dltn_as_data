<dc:description>Vouchers of loyalty were important in the post-Civil War period to prove a citizen did not actively participate in war against the Union.  Without them many Southern citizens could not vote or hold office. Records of investigations and loyalty oaths were required post-war for consideration of payment by the Quartermaster's Department.</dc:description>
