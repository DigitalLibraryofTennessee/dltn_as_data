<dc:description>Note the soldier denoted as "Physically and Mentally deranged." Though two-thousand cases of insanity and five-hundred suicides were recorded among the 600,000 soliders who served in the Federal Army, the limitations of nineteenth century notions of war, medicine, and mental illness- and the infancy of psychiatry and neurology- suggest we lack the full picture of combat stress. Research shows younger Civil War soldiers who saw more comrades die or who were POWs had increased physical and mental ailments later in life.</dc:description>
