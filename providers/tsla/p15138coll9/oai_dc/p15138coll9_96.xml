<dc:description>One function of the Quartermaster's Department was to pay non-army personnel for services rendered. Civilians were often hired by the Department as gravediggers, auctioneers, steamboat crews, wagon masters, teamsters, and construction engineers. As Federal forces advanced and occupied new territory, the Quartermaster's Department, often the first Federal agency to employ African Americans, faced the task of distributing clothing, housing, and rations and setting wages.</dc:description>
