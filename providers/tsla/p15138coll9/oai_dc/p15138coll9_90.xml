<dc:description>Prices were fixed by the Confederate Secretary of War and could include a fee for transport.  Prices were set as "maximums" to prevent profiteering. No year is indicated in this document, only the month (May), but it is a matter of record that the Confederacy began to suffer from the lack of food and supplies long before the end of the war.</dc:description>
