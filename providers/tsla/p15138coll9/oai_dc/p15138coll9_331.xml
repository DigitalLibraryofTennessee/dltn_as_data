<dc:description>The Commissary Department was in charge of all food or subsistence supplies at a military post.  The storehouses used by the Assistant Commissaries of Subsistence were provided by the Quartermaster Department; many of the storehouses were leaky, dilapidated, and full of rats, making it difficult to guard the company's store of foodstuffs.</dc:description>
