<dc:description>The Quartermaster of the Army provides logistical support to the combat troops in the form of ammunition, clothing, food, and pay.  Railroads were used extensively in the U.S. Civil War and were frequently the target of raids by both sides. Troops and supplies were transported via rail, which was the most vulnerable line of communication for both the Union and the Confederacy.</dc:description>
