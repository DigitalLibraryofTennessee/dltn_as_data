<dc:description>This list shows the number of men available for duty in the company.  More importantly, it shows the high percentage of people sick or otherwise unavailable for active duty. The only soldier on detached duty is the brigade butcher, whose responsibilities likely kept him from active duty with his company.</dc:description>
