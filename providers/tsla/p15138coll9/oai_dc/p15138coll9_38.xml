<dc:description>General orders are published directives issued by a commander, binding upon all personnel under his command to affect policies or procedures unique to a unit's situation and not addressed by service regulations.  General orders have the force of law within the unit where they are issued.  In this case the "commander" is the governor of the state, "commander in chief" of the state's militia. The order involves the requisition and assessment of private arms for military service.</dc:description>
