<dc:description>Boards of survey were convened in cases of destruction or loss of public property. The commanding officer usually called together a group of three officers to evaluate the property, determine the extent of the loss, and assign responsibility for the loss. The appointment of an inspector would follow, with that inspector assessing value and ruling on the property's condemnation or disposal.</dc:description>
