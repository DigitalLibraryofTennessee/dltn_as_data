<dc:description>General orders are published directives issued by a commander, binding upon all personnel under his command to affect policies or procedures unique to a unit's situation not addressed by service regulations. General orders have the force of law within the unit they are issued.  This Order is the result of a military tribunal trying an individual for unlawful guerilla warfare, which was relatively widespread in the occupied south and west of the Mississippi.</dc:description>
