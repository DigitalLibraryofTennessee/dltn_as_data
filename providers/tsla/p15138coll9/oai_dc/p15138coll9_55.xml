<dc:description>Much of Shelby County fell under Federal control following the Federal naval attack on Memphis June 6, 1862.  General Order No. 5 issued by Governor/Commander-in-Chief Isham G. Harris and Adjutant General W. C. Whitthorne on March 24, 1862, organized the state's Reserve Military Corps as required by an act of the General Assembly, passed March 18, 1862.  This general order was issued from the Executive Headquarters at Memphis.  Thus, it is assumed this reserve roll was recorded prior to the occupation of Memphis and subjugation of much of Shelby County.</dc:description>
