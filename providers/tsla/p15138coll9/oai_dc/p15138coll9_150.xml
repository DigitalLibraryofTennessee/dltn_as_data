<dc:description>This Civil War form provides a good indication of the types of ordnance materials regularly issued to Federal cavalry troops during the war.  It also emphasizes the importance placed on accounting for items issued to soldiers in regular returns. Lost items would be charged to soldiers. Captain Ezekiel W. Bass headed up Company K, which mustered at Murfreesboro on February 22, 1863, and consisted of men from Middle Tennessee counties.</dc:description>
