<dc:description>Ammunition listings for this federal unit reflect weapons commonly used by Civil War cavalry soldiers.  James H. Merrill, a Baltimore gunsmith, designed the breechloading Merrill Carbine, an early contract carbine. Samuel Colt of Hartford, Connecticut, produced the most handguns during the Civil War period, including the Colt Army Pistol (1860 "New Model Army"); he produced 150,000 of these six-shot revolvers. His .36 caliber "Navy" model revolver was introduced in 1851.</dc:description>
