<dc:description>Four Catholic Dominican sisters from Somerset, Ohio, founded St. Cecilia as a female school in 1860, and the first class graduated in 1862.  Students from both Tennessee and other states displayed divided loyalties during the Civil War. The fall of the city in 1862 brought federal sentinels to the gates of the institution for the rest of the war. The guards proved a benefit to the academy, allowing it to remain open for the duration of the conflict.</dc:description>
