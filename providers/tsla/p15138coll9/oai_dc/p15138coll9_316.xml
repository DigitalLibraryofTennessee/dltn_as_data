<dc:description>When trade privileges were restored to Tennessee on March 5, 1863, trade permits were at first issued by special U. S. Treasury agent Allen A. Hall, but a month later Military Governor Andrew Johnson directed that applications be sent to Tennessee Secretary of State Edward H. East or A. V. S. Lindsley.  East would be appointed president of the Nashville Board of Trade when Treasury agent W. P. Mellen arrived in Nashville on May 15, 1863, to officially organize a board of trade.</dc:description>
