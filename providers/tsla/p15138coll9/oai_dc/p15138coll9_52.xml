<dc:description>Detailed rosters were maintained to keep track of soldiers available to serve as infantrymen in the lines.  Men on "extra duty" were not always freed from infantry service, especially those serving as teamsters, but others serving in special positions, such as mechanics, hospital staff, and engineers, were deemed more valuable in those roles than in the role of an infantry private.</dc:description>
