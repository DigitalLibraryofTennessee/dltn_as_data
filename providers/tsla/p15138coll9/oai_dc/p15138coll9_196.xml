<dc:description>Certificate of parole for Leander H. Russ, a cavalry escort of General Nathan Bedford Forrest, from Camp Chase, Ohio, issued by W. P. Richardson, Commandant of Prisons. The certificate includes a physical description of Russ and a notarized letter from Russ, signed in 1924, correcting his military record --the muster roll of Forrest's escort had incorrectly reported that he had deserted.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The parole certificate includes an oath to faithfully support the federal government and the proclamations of the President issued during the rebellion. This parole is not to be confused with the official oath of allegiance many confederate soldiers signed upon surrender in 1865, but it performs the same function.</dc:description>
