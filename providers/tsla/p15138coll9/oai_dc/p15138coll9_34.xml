<dc:description>Robinson applied for pay for "extra duty," the term for any assignment taken on outside of his assigned mlitary role.  Such duties could include foraging, engineering, carpentry, and, in this case, espionage.  These fees were paid separately from standard soldiers' wages.  Brevet Brigadier General Benjamin Card was the Chief Quartermaster of the U. S. Army. The Quartermaster of the Army provides logistical support to the combat troops in the form of ammunition, clothing, food, and pay.</dc:description>
