Circular
To officers Comdg. Troops doing duty as Engineers or Pioneers.
	The act of Congress lately passed authorizing the raising of an Engineer regiment permits the enlistment of all men who are or have been doing duty as Engineers, Pontoniers, or Pioneers.
	The original act sent to Washington was drafted by me and limited the men to be enlisted to present and former members of the Pioneeer Brigade. The act as passed was re-written in Washington and was not seen by me until after it had passed both houses and became a law.
	It would be manifestly unjust to insist upon the use of the full authority conferred by the law and therefore I have instructed all recruiting officers to decline enlisting any men from the Michigan Engineers, the 58th Indiana, or the Engineer Brigade who are not ex-Pioneers. As it would be legal, however, to do so I have authorized them to enlist other than ex-Pioneers on the written consent of regimental commanders.
