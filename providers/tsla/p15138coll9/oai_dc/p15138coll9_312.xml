<dc:description>Nashville's Board of Trade was established by Miltary Governor Andrew Johnson in conjunction with the U.S. Treasury Department following Federal occupation of the city. The Board was Johnson's effort to regulate commerce with the North from Nashville, to ensure the loyalty of tradesmen, and to secure the confidence of the loyal manufacturers and merchants.  Both the Federal Quartermaster and Tennessee's Adjutant General were involved in this endeavor, as this was actually a military board.</dc:description>
