<dc:description>Federal General Ulysses S. Grant began an attack on Fort Donelson on February 11, 1862, in an attempt to open up the Cumberland River for Union access.  Confederate General Gideon Pillow was effectively in command of the Confederates besieged in the fort and attempted a breakout before being beaten back. Nominal Confederate commanders Floyd and Johnson turned official command over to Pillow, who surrendered after Federal reinforcements arrived on February 16, 1862.</dc:description>
