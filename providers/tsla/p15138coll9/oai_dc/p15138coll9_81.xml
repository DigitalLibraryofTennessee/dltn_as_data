<dc:description>Consolidated morning reports listed the number of men available for duty in a certain regiment. The detailed list showed the numbers of officers, non-commissioned officers, enlisted men, surgeons, etc., available within each company. Reports were issued daily to ensure that an accurate count was always available.  The "Senior" in this unit's designation indicates that it antedated lower-numbered Tennessee regiments in the Civil War.  The "154" comes from its 1842 founding as a Tennessee Militia regiment that incorporated in 1860. With the war, the unit reorganized at Randolph in Shelby County.</dc:description>
