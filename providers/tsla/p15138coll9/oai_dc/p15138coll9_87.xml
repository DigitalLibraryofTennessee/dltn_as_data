<dc:description>With Federal troops at the front during Sherman's Atlanta Campaign, the Governor and the military sought security, given increasing Confederate cavalry and guerrilla raids.  Johnson chose to call up the militia through a governor's proclamation. The Militia Enrollment Proclamation made justices of the peace  responsible for overseeing the sign-up of males between 18 and 50.  This marked the first time in the state's history that African Americans were to be included as members of the militia.</dc:description>
