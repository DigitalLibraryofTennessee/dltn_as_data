<dc:description>General orders are published directives issued by a commander, binding upon all personnel under his command.  Soldiers of the Civil War, especially Federal soldiers with more effective logistics operations, seldom went hungry. The ration as ordered in General order No. 226 was fairly typical of the Federal ration during the war, and, while it could be reduced when necessary, it was often fulfilled effectively, minus perhaps only a sufficient amount of vegetables.</dc:description>
