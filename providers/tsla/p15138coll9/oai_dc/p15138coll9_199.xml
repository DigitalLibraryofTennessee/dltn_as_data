<dc:description>Vance's term of enlistment was one year; many other soldiers were called to serve three years.  Once both the U. S. Government and the Confederacy began to use the draft to build their armies, the terms of service varied widely. Furthermore, a draftee could buy his way out of the army, or pay someone else to serve in his place.</dc:description>
