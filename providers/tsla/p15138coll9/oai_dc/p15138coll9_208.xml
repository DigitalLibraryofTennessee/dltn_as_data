<dc:description>This was a typical oath signed by captured or surrendering Confederate soldiers when released on  parole in order to return to their homes on their own recognizance. It is a separate and distinct document from the "oath of allegiance" many Confederate soldiers had to sign after the general surrender of Confederate hostilities in 1865.</dc:description>
