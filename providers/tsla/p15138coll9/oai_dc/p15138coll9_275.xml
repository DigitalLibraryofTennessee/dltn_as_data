<dc:description>By definition, a ration is the amount of food authorized for one soldier (or animal) for one day.  The Confederate government adopted the official U. S. Army ration at the start of the war, although by the spring of 1862 they had to reduce the amount because of food shortages that affected not only the military but also the entire Southern civilian population.</dc:description>
