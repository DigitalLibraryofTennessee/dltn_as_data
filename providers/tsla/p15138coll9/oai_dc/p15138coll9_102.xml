<dc:description>This list was probably created in response to Governor's General Order No. 1.  General orders are published directives issued by a commander, binding upon all personnel under his command to affect policies or procedures unique to a unit's situation not addressed by service regulations.  General orders have the force of law within the unit where they are issued.  This order involves the requisition and assessment of private arms for military use.</dc:description>
