<dc:description>The U. S. War Dept. issued General Order No. 143 on May 22, 1863, establishing a "Bureau of Colored Troops." Around 175 United States Colored Troops regiments with over 178,000 soldiers (about 1/10 of all federal troops) served during the last two years of the Civil War. Black soldiers under the command of white officers received less pay than their white counterparts, were widely admired for their courage, and suffered high combat losses.</dc:description>
