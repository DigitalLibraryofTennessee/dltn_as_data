<dc:description>One-page handwritten form, designated Form No. 33, Voucher for Abstract G, reflects the requisition for a month's forage for one private horse in the service of the Confederate States Army, along with the receipt or voucher information indicating that the requisition for forage by Major J. J. Lamb of the 5th Tennessee was filled by Regimental Quartermaster J. E. Ray. This voucher will be recorded on Abstract G, possibly with additional forms representing financial transactions.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In terms of Civil War quartermaster documentation, vouchers represent the actual exchanges that are happening in the field.  As one moves up the chain of document organization from Voucher to Abstract to Report or Return, one is stepping further and further away from the recorded individual transaction.</dc:description>
