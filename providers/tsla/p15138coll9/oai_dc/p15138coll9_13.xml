<dc:description>Assistant Quartermaster in Nashville from February 1862 through July 1864, Simon Perkins Jr.  was responsible for the burial of U.S. military personnel, contrabands, prisoners of war, and government employees who died in the city. The surgeon in charge of each hospital would attach relevant information to the body or the coffin and send it to the quartermaster, who would record the data, designate the number and location of the grave, and issue a burial order to the sexton.</dc:description>
