<dc:description>Fort Donelson fell on February 16, 1862, and Federal occupation of Nashville soon followed, as the Federal Army of Don Carlos Buell marched into the city. At the end of that month, Nashville became the first state capital to fall to the Federal troops. Confederate uprisings and guerrilla attacks continued sporadically against the city, but had little effect overall. The amount claimed to this Nashville Board of Commissioners was over $2.6 million. The amount awarded for damages was over $1 million.</dc:description>
