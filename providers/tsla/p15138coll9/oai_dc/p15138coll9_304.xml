<dc:description>One-page printed and handwritten Board of Trade affidavit represents the oath of Joseph Ambrose that the supplies for which he requests transportation are a requirement for his family in Nashville and will be used solely for that purpose. Surveyor of Customs Edward H. East signed the affidavit. The attached invoice lists the family goods. All of this documentation had to be in place to receive a permit or a recommendation of the Board of Trade.</dc:description>

<dc:description>When trade privileges were restored to Tennessee on March 5, 1863, trade permits were at first issued by special U. S. Treasury agent Allen A. Hall, but a month later Military Governor Andrew Johnson directed applications to be sent to Tennessee Secretary of State Edward H. East or A. V. S. Lindsley.  East would be appointed president of the Nashville Board of Trade when Treasury agent W. P. Mellen arrived in Nashville on May 15, 1863, to officially organize a board of trade.</dc:description>
