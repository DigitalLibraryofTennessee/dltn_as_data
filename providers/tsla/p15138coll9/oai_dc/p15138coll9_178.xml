	The following extracts of a letter captured in the skirmish of the 14th inst. and written by one of the enemy are published for the information of the Soldiers of the army.
Perhaps you would lend me your attention for a few moments and let me recount the adventures &amp; moves &amp; draws of this &#8220;Left-wing army of the Ohio&#8221; we the 117 Regt. Indiana Vols Infy six month men have lead a checkered life for the past two &amp; one half months. We&#8217;ve seen that Elephant in a shape that few Indiana soldiers have seen him. We had seen fighting some of us. Our Col was in all the Vicksburg fights as Maj of the 8th but fighting of the soldiering by a long shot as you are well aware. In the last ten weeks we have marched nearly 500 miles and for the past two months have never drawn full rations. When we got to Morristown we were put on quarter rations. We went to Greensville 65 miles N.E. of Cumberland Gap and drew no rations for three days. Then drew meal and &#190; rations of fresh beef without salt. Corn had been issued to us as rations and we have had for days at a time absolutely nothing but parched corn and beef. Forty rounds of parched corn in your Haversacks was an order from Sergt Berry to his squad about a month ago. And it has passed into the Regt as a general order for every march. We retreated from Greenville on a run to Bull&#8217;s Gap which we commenced fortifying and the paper stated our position as impregnable

[Page 2 of 3]

Before the Telegraph had given publicity to the news our impregnable position was evacuated and we are &#8220;Skedaddling&#8221; for Cumberland Gap. We had nothing to eat there for several days except a little and once or twice some parched corn. Our Brigade goes among the troops by the name of the Parched Corn Brigade Wilcox&#8217;s running Tigers. &amp; the Lank Expectant Hoosey. We have been four times in hearing of several sharp little fights one in sight. But never yet in a skirmish. We marched &amp; countermarched advanced and retreated and have killed a good many men by foolish running and unnecessary starvation. We went beyond Cumberland Gap into Ky. &amp; there we went two days with nothing to eat save parched corn &amp; meat which we foraged for. We drew some flour there that just lammed it to any thing you ever saw. If you would take the screenings from a flowering mill &amp; to one bushel add a peck of oats &amp; another peck of dirt &amp; grind it all &amp; you have a bushel &amp; a half of the kind of flour that was issued to us on Yellow Creek Ky. I have a specimen of the bread &amp; will save it until we the 117th Reg Ind Vol Infy.  &#8211; d&#8212;d six months (that&#8217;s or title, the swearing is not mine) are mustered out exhibited it in Indiana &amp; then send it to Barnum for his celebrated museum. Strady hast.
Quick ! Marching orders! We left Clich river on the 10th and advanced to the top of this mountain six miles from old camps. We are incamped right square in the gap where the wind whistles &amp; [blows?] &amp; cuts our cloths of our backs. It is awful cold here. Where at the base of the mountain it is as warm as summer. Rebs left here the day before we got here. They had several thousand at Beans Station

The publication of the forgoing letter has been suggested by the knowledge of your own hardships &amp; perils &amp; that you might compare them with those of the enemy. And [see?] that they too have their privations which according to the writer of this letter far exceeds our own. If those who come upon our soil to invade us with the avowed purpose of subjugation can carry out their work under such trials, &amp; with such gayety &amp; cheerfulness as this letter exhibits far much more of that endurance, patience, &amp; hope should you have, who are resisting tyranny and are fighting for you honor your homes &amp; your liberty. Let it not be said that the heart of the invader is stronger &amp; stouter than the determination of you, who fight for your all.
	Your wants are known to your Gen and every effort has been made to relieve them. Supplies of clothing &amp; shoes have been ordered and are daily expected until they arrive you are called upon to support the signs of a severe and trying campaign, with the same manly fortitude &amp; patience that has always been so honorable to you
