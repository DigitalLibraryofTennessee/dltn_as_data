<dc:description>The Machinery Building was of Greek-Doric style architecture and displayed machinery of every variety. Two innovations displayed were a round-bale cotton press and an automatic gear-cutting machine. The engines inside the building furnished all the power to operate every electric light, as well as the arc lights on the ground.</dc:description>
