<dc:description>The "Red Men's Tepee" was the headquarters of the Improved Order of Red Men. Its members dressed like "Indians," complete with war paint and feathers. They practiced "Indian" customs and even played the role of the foes of Custer and the 7th Cavalry in the re-creation of the Battle of Little Big Horn during military week in August 1897.</dc:description>
