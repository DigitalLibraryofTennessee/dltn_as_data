<dc:description>The ornate Spanish Renaissance-style architecture was used in the design of the Negro Building.  The cornerestone was laid on March 13, 1897.  The orator of the day was Professor W. H. Council, principal of the Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes in Normal, Alabama.  There were over 300 exhibitions from 85 cities with displays which included information on education, science, technology, banking, and art.  Fisk University's exhibit showed the possibilities for African Americans in higher education. Tuskegee Institute in Alabama was represented by Booker T. Washington, who was special guest on Emancipation Day, September 22.</dc:description>
