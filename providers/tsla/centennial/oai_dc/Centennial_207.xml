The central and largest room was set apart for History and Antiquities; another room was for the use of the Confederate Veterans; one room for the Grand Army of the Republic; one for the Colonial Dames and Daughters of the American Revolution; and the last room was for miscellaneous purposes. The History Building stood near the Parthenon.</dc:description>
