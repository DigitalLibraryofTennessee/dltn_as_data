<dc:description>Lake Katherine was named after "Bonnie Kate" Sevier, the second wife of Tennessee's first Governor, John Sevier.  The dam and waterwheel are shown at the center of the photograph.  The waterwheel came from an area near Nashville called the Leatherwoods. A Lithia water stand was just beyond the dam, and the Minerals and Forestry Building stood to the left.</dc:description>
