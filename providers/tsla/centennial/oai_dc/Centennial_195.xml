<dc:description>The Terminal Station of the Tennessee Centennial and International Exposition marks the entrance of the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railway onto the grounds of the Centennial City.  This one hundred foot square building allowed railroad lines to highlight the vegetable and mineral products of the soils that bordered their routes.  The states of Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, and Georgia were represented.  J. B. Killebrew was responsible for the exhibit staged by the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railway. Indian and war relics took their place alongside the various agricultural and mineral displays. The tobacco exhibit within these walls warranted particular attention.</dc:description>
