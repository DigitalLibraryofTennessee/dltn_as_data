<dc:description>Inside the circular walls of the Cyclorama was a painting which depicted the famous charge of Gen. Pickett's Division at the stone wall on the 3rd day of the Battle of Gettysburg. This work is said to have required 16 months of labor by 13 artists. Seven tons of paint were used. The exhibit was popular with Union and Confederate veterans alike and contained many relics from the Civil War.</dc:description>
