<dc:description>Entertainment and amusement were a part of great fairs and expositions. At the Tennessee Centennial, various shows from all parts of the world were centered in one street called "Vanity Fair." This area provided the fairgoer with a choice of many strange and exotic entertainments, including the one pictured here. Children especially enjoyed this amusement, with its lions and monkeys.</dc:description>
