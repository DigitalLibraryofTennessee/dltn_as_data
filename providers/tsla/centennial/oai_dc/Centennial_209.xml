<dc:subject>Tennessee Centennial and International Exposition (1897 : Nashville, Tenn.)</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Photograph featuring the Giant See-Saw, a very popular attraction located in the midway of Vanity Fair at the Tennessee Centennial Exposition.  This shot taken from a nearby hill shows Spain's Palace of Illusions (Mirror Maze) on the left and the Old Vienna Restaurant on the right. The cabins were transported from East Tennessee and were equipped with a functioning moonshine still.  Other Centennial buildings that appear in the background are the Hygiene and Education Building, the Commerce Building, a bit of the Parthenon, and in the far distance appears the Memphis Building (Pyramid of Cheops). The Gerst Brewing Company maintained a number of stations on the premises. The advertisement appearing in the image credits them with the best beer and the best meals on the grounds.</dc:description>
