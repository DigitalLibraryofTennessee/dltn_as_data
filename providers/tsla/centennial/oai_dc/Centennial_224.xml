<dc:description>Front view of the Woman's Building at the Tennessee Centennial Exposition. The building was somewhat modeled after Andrew Jackson's home, the Hermitage.  In addition, the building also had features of Grecian architecture. Eight massive columns supported the roof, on top of which was an observatory.  The front steps, each thirty-five feet long, were made of Tennessee marble.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Woman's Building was designed by Mrs. Sarah Ward-Conley.  Visitors could enjoy lunch at the restaurant located in the observatory, buy articles made by women in the salesroom, view inventions made by women in the Patent Room, or take cooking lessons in the model kitchen.  The interior of the Woman's Building was decorated with all things considered beautiful, such as inviting colors, Tiffany stained glass, mural decorations, exquisite furnishings, fresh flowers, and silk draperies.  The building also included a library made of black walnut and a pink room with pink velvet carpet that housed portrait statues.</dc:description>
