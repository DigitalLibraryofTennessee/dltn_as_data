<dc:description>The Auditorium was the site of a large number of concerts and ceremonies during the Exposition. The bells were played on special occasions, such as Opening Day, Independence Day and Ohio Day when President William McKinley came to visit. The Auditorium seated over 6,000 people. Crowds heard concerts performed by Guston Fischer's Band, Victor Herbert's 24th New York Regimental Band, and others. Today the bells hang in the Tulip Street Methodist Church in Nashville. This building was considered by many to be the "least pretty" of all the buildings. The Commerce Building housed exhibits from Nashville businesses as well as from countries throughout the world. Included in the building were exhibits sponsored by William Gerst Brewing Company, Marshall and Bruce Company, Gray-Dudley Hardware Company, and Phillips and Buttorff Manufacturing Company.</dc:description>
