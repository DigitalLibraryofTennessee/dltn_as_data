<dc:description>The Illinois Building was erected by the State of Illinois as a miniature reproduction of the Administration building at the Chicago World's Fair.  It was one-sixth the size of the original, and was used as a headquarters for Illinois visitors.  The building was located at the end of Capitol Avenue, and was in view of the Rialto and the Parthenon.  The Illinois Legislature donated $60,000 for the construction of the building.  Surrounding the building was statuary representing elements of nature and man's creative spirit.</dc:description>
