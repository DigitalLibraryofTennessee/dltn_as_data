<dc:description>The Chute was a water ride in which the passenger boarded a boat that slid down a steep incline and splashed into the lake below, covering onlookers with a spray of water. The attraction was located at the highest point in the park. The pool of water was only 30 inches deep.  A ride on the Chute cost 10 cents.</dc:description>
