<dc:subject>Tennessee Centennial and International Exposition (1897 : Nashville, Tenn.)</dc:subject>

The Commerce Building, the Education Building and the Giant See-Saw are in the background of the photograph.  Lake Watauga occupies the foreground of the image.  The prevalence of flags flying, bench seating, and such infrastructure elements as sidewalks, street lamps, and decorative railings and columns on the grounds reveal the mammoth scale of this undertaking for the State of Tennessee.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Tennessee Centennial and International Exposition was held in the 200-acre West Side Park of Nashville and ran from May 1, 1897 to October 30, 1897.  The event honored the 100th year of statehood for Tennessee; the celebration was delayed one year due to financing problems and the unfinished state of some attractions.  The site itself was renamed Centennial City and featured thirty-five major structures on its grounds.  The location had served as the historic site for the mustering of troops for the War of 1812, the Mexican War, and the Civil War before becoming the Old Fair Grounds and a harness racing park.</dc:description>
