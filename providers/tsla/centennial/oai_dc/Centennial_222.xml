<dc:description>The replica of the Parthenon was the Nashville-Davidson County building. The decision was made to build the Parthenon because Nashville was known as "The Athens of the South." During the Exposition it housed nearly 1,200 pieces of artwork and sculpture from all over the world. The Parthenon was situated in the center of the Exposition grounds. The pedestal sculptures beneath the roofline depicted the contest between Poseidon and Athena. The west pediment sculptures of the ancient Parthenon were reproduced by sculptor George Zolnay at both ends of the building and were made of plaster. The Parthenon is the only structure that remains of all the Exposition buildings. It was reconstructed in the 1920s, and became a permanent structure.</dc:description>
