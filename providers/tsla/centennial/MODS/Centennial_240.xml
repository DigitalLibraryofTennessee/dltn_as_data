      <title>Tennessee Centennial Exposition</title>
    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>In 1897, Tennessee held a six-month celebration to mark the one-hundredth anniversary of statehood.  The Tennessee Centennial Exposition was held in Nashville from May 1 until October 30, 1897, although the state’s actual centennial occurred in 1896.  The images in this collection primarily depict the array of buildings and individuals involved with this celebration, and are drawn from various record groups in the holdings of the Tennessee State Library and Archives.  Other interesting ephemera relating to the Centennial Exposition is also displayed, including a rare cyanotype of a building at the exhibition’s Vanity Fair....</abstract>
