<dc:description>In the first decades of the twentieth century, Tennessee made efforts to erect healthier and more modern schools, hire better trained teachers, provide for student transportation, and to more competently manage and supervise education practices.  The state also embarked upon a program of consolidation and new construction so that schools like Old Bells Colored were abandoned.  Bells Consolidated Rosenwald School replaced it.</dc:description>
