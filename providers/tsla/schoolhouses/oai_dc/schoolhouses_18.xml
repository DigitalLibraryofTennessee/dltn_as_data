<dc:description>Two large brick buildings comprise the campus of Grand Junction School.  The two-story structure at right appears to be for classrooms, while the one at left appears to be a gymnasium or field house.  A line of people, possibly in caps and gowns, marches toward the field house.  An American flag flies on a pole in the center.</dc:description>
