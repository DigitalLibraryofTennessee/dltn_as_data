<dc:description>Opened in July 1929 with funding from the Rosenwald Foundation, this school for African American children of Hohenwald consisted of two classrooms, restrooms, and a kitchen. It served grades one through eight, replacing the old Hohenwald school for "colored" children.  The institution closed in the mid-1960s.</dc:description>
