<dc:description>During this time period, the Tennessee State Board of Education was evaluating many one-room schools for possible consolidation.  Figures on the back of this image suggest that the Board was considering consolidating Old Matlock and Byrds Chapel Schools.  The figures represent estimates for the building, grounds, and improvement costs foe the new school.  Rachel Peebles is listed as the teacher for "Matlocks Chapel" for 1927-1928.</dc:description>
