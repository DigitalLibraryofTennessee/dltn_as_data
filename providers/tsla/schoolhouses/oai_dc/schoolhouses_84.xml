<dc:description>The legislature passed a bill on April 4, 1881, establishing a school for the Negro deaf.  The Negro school was closed at the beginning of the Christmas holidays in 1940 and an extensive improvement program began.  Henry C. Edmunds, the principal, helped with the work.  Modern electric and heating systems were installed; the floors and walls were replaced; and a cement-block extension was built onto the back of the main building.</dc:description>
