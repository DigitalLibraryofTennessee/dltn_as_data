<dc:description>This school was in a rural area north of the Lee Highway.  It was abandoned and consolidated with Liberty which was nearer to Lee Highway and probably more accessible.  Many schools were abandoned due to the consolidation that took place in the first decades of the twentieth century. The state was striving to improve the public school system throughout Tennessee.</dc:description>
