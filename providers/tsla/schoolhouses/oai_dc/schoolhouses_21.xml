<dc:description>The William J. Hale School, located on McGhee Street in Maryville, was built in early 1930 with Rosenwald funds.  The school opened in 1931 and Mrs. Octavia B. Hoard was the first principal.   The Hale School replaced the T. B. Lillard School, built about 1910.  The T. B. Lillard School was named for Thomas B. Lillard, an African American and progressive businessman from Maryville.  The Lillard School was located at the rear of the A.M.E. Church on what is now Harper Avenue.</dc:description>
