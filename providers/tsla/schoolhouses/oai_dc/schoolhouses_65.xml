<dc:description>The first school for African Americans in Linden employed one teacher. Classes were originally held in an old abandoned building owned by Mrs. Adeline Brashear Craig. Later it was moved to Robert's Chapel A.M.E. Church.  Here it remained for a period of sixty years. A new school was completed in 1950.</dc:description>
