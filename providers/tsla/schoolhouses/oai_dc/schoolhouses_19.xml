<dc:description>During this period, the Tennessee State Board of Education was evaluating many one-room schools for possible consolidation.  On the back of this image is recorded the following conclusion:  "should be consolidated with Liberty." Old Neophagen was an eighth-grade school. Located on Highway 69A six miles north of Camden, it was first called Bells School. H. W. Presson is listed as the teacher for 1927-1928.  This school was one of the oldest in Benton County and was eventually torn down.</dc:description>
