<dc:description>This African American school had two classrooms, one teacher, and 56 students. The school was isolated, having no other schools nearby. Neither did it have a library, an encyclopedia, nor a dictionary. At least twenty-five cents a year was spent on each student but the structure itself was in very poor condition.  Evidence of good housekeeping was observed.  Evidently, the only source of heat was a fireplace at one end of the building.</dc:description>
