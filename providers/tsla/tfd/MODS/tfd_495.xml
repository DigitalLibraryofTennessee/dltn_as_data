  <abstract>This first revision of the Tennessee Constitution addressed a variety of problems present in the original 1796 Constitution. Pages are handwritten on oversize paper and are laminated. In the period between 1796 and 1834, the population of Tennessee grew at large percentage. In 1800, Tennessee’s population was 105,602, and by 1830, the population had grown to 681,904. By 1830, Tennessee could no longer be considered the frontier. Tennessee had an urban population of over 5,000. The Constitution that governed those first Tennesseans, a few thousand rural settlers, was now becoming stressed trying to govern a population reaching nearly 700,000. An introduction to this document is available here: http://tsla.tnsosfiles.com/digital/teva/intros/33662.pdf .</abstract>
