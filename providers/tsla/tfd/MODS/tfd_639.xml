  <abstract>This constitution is the "Houston Constitution," rejected by Franklin's Second Constitutional Convention of 1785 in Greeneville. Constitutional committee member and major contributor Rev. Samuel Houston had these pamphlets printed to argue the merits of the rejected document in the preface. Still infused with the spirit of the American Revolution and with an appetite already whetted by forays into self-government, the inhabitants of North Carolina’s trans-Appalachian counties of Washington, Sullivan, and Greene jumped at the opportunity that North Carolina’s cession of its western lands presented. The state of North Carolina faced financial distress and carried the burden of war debt. The challenges of governing its distant western settlements proved a strain. The legislature of North Carolina orchestrated the “Great Land Grab of 1783,” allowing many of its members and major land speculators to obtain title to the best lands in the area. Thus, it seemed advantageous to cede its western lands to Congress in 1784, with the provision that the titles remain valid. Western residents of the Holston-Watauga region met in that same year at Jonesborough and unanimously confirmed their interest in forming an independent state. When they met again in Jonesborough in December of 1784, they drafted a temporary, provisional constitution for the newly-formed State of Franklin, named in honor of Benjamin Franklin. Unbeknownst to them, a month earlier North Carolina had repealed its Cession Act.
