  <abstract>"An act for the establishment of Washington College in honor to the Illustrious President of the United States at Salem in Washington County." The act is handwritten and is five pages in length. The resolution passed at Knoxville on July 10, 1795. It is signed by Governor William Blount. The act renaming re-naming St. Martin’s Academy to Washington College in honor of President George Washington was one of the varied acts passed by the Southwest Territory General Assembly. Samuel Doak (1749-1830), a Virginia Presbyterian minister and pioneer, assumed his first pastorate in Abingdon, Virginia, and also began to "ride circuit" in eastern Tennessee. In 1778 he settled in Tennessee in Sullivan County and was ordained a minister. In 1780 he moved to Washington County, where he formed Salem Church and a school, which was chartered as St. Martin's Academy in 1783, the first chartered school in the region. In 1795 it became Washington College. A short introduction to this document is available here: http://tsla.tnsosfiles.com/digital/teva/intros/33669.pdf .</abstract>
