  <abstract>This document is a nine page, unnumbered handwritten document found in "Acts of the Southwest Territory." It is dated July 11, 1795, and signed by Governor William Blount and Joseph Hardin. On May 26, 1790, President George Washington signed into law an act of Congress passed earlier in the month that established the Territory of the United States South of the River Ohio (Southwest Territory). Embracing the western lands ceded by the state of North Carolina on December 22, 1789, the new territory was to be governed under the terms of the Ordinance of 1787, which created its predecessor, the Northwest Territory. An introduction to this document is available here: http://tsla.tnsosfiles.com/digital/teva/intros/33668.pdf .</abstract>
