<dc:title>Tennessee Civil and Military Commission Book, Volume 1</dc:title>
<dc:description>This bound volume maintained by the Secretary of State represents the chronological recording of civil and military commissions issued by the Governor of Tennessee, John Sevier, from the beginning of statehood in 1796 to 1801. The front section of the book includes those commissions that primarily reflect positions of state authority and is followed by commissions divided by county. The entries include the name of the individual, their commissioned position, and the date issued. The volume has no name. 
 The commission system that is represented by this volume recognizes individuals in the state who have been entrusted by the Governor with positions of military and civil authority. Appointments made by the state&#8217;s first governor John Sevier proved key as the former Territory of the United States of America South of the River Ohio adjusted to statehood and strove for stability. The positions that are recorded in this earliest volume are those that support the institutions of representative government, provide military security, and maintain order and structure within the fledgling state.
