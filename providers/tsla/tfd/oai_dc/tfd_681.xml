<dc:title>Tennessee Constitution, 1796</dc:title>
<dc:description>Tennessee's first constitution, adopted in 1796. Handwritten in ink on paper. The 1796 Tennessee Constitution was drafted in Knoxville over a four week period by a convention of fifty-five delegates (two delegates from each of the territory's eleven counties). These delegates included William Blount (president of the convention), James Robertson, William Cocke, and Andrew Jackson. Although John Sevier did not participate directly in the proceedings, he did work behind the scenes to promote Blount's position. The convention delegates never intended to present the Constitution to the citizens for ratification. Instead, the delegates hurried to finish the Constitution in order to present a copy to Congress before their spring adjournment. After much contention, a compromise was reached giving Tennessee immediate statehood on the condition of having only one representative in the House. The bill was signed by President Washington on June 1, 1796.    The 1796 Constitution's declarations on rights, taxation, and legislative authority were drawn largely from the North Carolina and Pennsylvania constitutions. The Declaration of Rights and the position on suffrage differentiate Tennessee's constitution from others of its time. According to historian J.G.M. Ramsey, Thomas Jefferson described Tennessee's as the "least imperfect and most republican of the state constitutions." Article III, Section 1st gives all freemen (white and black) twenty-one years of age who owned a freehold or who had resided in the county six months the right to vote. There was also a provision giving men serving in the militia the right to elect their officers.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Drafted hastily by convention in the winter of 1796, Tennessee's first Constitution was sent to the seat of national government in Philadelphia for ratification in spring of that same year. The positions on individual rights and suffrage distinguish this Constitution from others of its time. All free adult men, regardless of race, who owned a freehold, were allowed to vote. Since land speculators were prominent among the framers of the constitution, it provided for "equal and uniform" taxation of land and slaves. Most authority was vested in the state legislature, while the actual powers of the governor were quite limited. The Declaration of Rights, the constitution's most lengthy provision, reaffirmed ideas of political and individual rights espoused in the federal Bill of Rights. The Declaration asserted that since government was created "for the common benefit, the doctrine of non-resistance against arbitrary power and oppression is absurd, slavish, and destructive to the good and happiness of mankind." (Article IX, Section 2nd). Included in the Declaration of Rights are the freedoms of religion, press, assembly and speech. Rights of the accused are particularly well-defined. Section 6th provides that only "judgment of his peers" or the "law of the land" could strip a citizen of life, liberty, or property. The accused were protected from double jeopardy (Section 10th) and excessive bail (Section 16th). Section 29th of the Declaration, specifying the inherent right to free and unhampered navigation of the Mississippi River, was of paramount concern to landlocked Tennessee settlers. The Declaration of Rights has remained a constant element in all subsequent Tennessee constitutions.</dc:description>
