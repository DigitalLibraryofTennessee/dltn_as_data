<dc:title>An Act for the Enumeration of the Inhabitants of the Territory of the United States of America South of the River Ohio</dc:title>
<dc:description>This document is a nine page, unnumbered handwritten document found in "Acts of the Southwest Territory." It is dated July 11, 1795, and signed by Governor William Blount and Joseph Hardin. On May 26, 1790, President George Washington signed into law an act of Congress passed earlier in the month that established the Territory of the United States South of the River Ohio (Southwest Territory). Embracing the western lands ceded by the state of North Carolina on December 22, 1789, the new territory was to be governed under the terms of the Ordinance of 1787, which created its predecessor, the Northwest Territory.

<dc:description>On May 26, 1790, President George Washington signed into law an act of Congress passed earlier in the month that established the Territory of the United States South of the River Ohio (Southwest Territory). Embracing the western lands ceded by the state of North Carolina on December 22, 1789, the new territory was to be governed under the terms of the Ordinance of 1787, which created its predecessor, the Northwest Territory. This act, passed at the second session of the Southwest Territory General Assembly on July 11, 1795, called for the enumeration of all white male citizens in the territory. On November 28, 1795, the collected census reports from all eleven counties indicated that there were 77,262 inhabitants in the Southwest Territory, a total comfortably exceeding the minimum required for statehood (60,000).</dc:description>
