<dc:title>Tennessee Constitution, 1834</dc:title>
<dc:description>This first revision of the Tennessee Constitution addressed a variety of problems present in the original 1796 Constitution. Pages are handwritten on oversize paper and are laminated. In the period between 1796 and 1834, the population of Tennessee grew at large percentage. In 1800, Tennessee&#8217;s population was 105,602, and by 1830, the population had grown to 681,904. By 1830, Tennessee could no longer be considered the frontier. Tennessee had an urban population of over 5,000. The Constitution that governed those first Tennesseans, a few thousand rural settlers, was now becoming stressed trying to govern a population reaching nearly 700,000.

<dc:description>In the first half of the nineteenth century a number of states, responding to social forces pressing the case for a greater role for the average white citizen, revised their constitutions. Tennessee became part of this trend when, on May 19, 1834, sixty delegates assembled in Nashville in a constitutional convention and selected William Carter of Carter County as president of the proceedings. The principal interests of the delegates concerned the provisions of the 1796 constitution dealing with taxation and representation. White citizens received greater opportunities for political expression and office holding. However, the newfound concern with the "common man" extended to whites only. In making suffrage changes, the delegates restricted the vote to white men, thereby disfranchising free black males, who had voted under the 1796 Constitution. A variety of other issues were addressed. Antislavery groups petitioned for the abolition of slavery, but the delegates rejected their appeals. Instead, the convention added language requiring the approval of slave owners for the passage of any future acts of emancipation. When presented to the voters in March 1835, the new constitution was ratified by a vote of 42,666 in favor to 17,691 against.</dc:description>
