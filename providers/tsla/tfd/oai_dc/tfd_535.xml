<dc:title>An Act to Cut and Clear a Waggon Road to the Settlements on the Cumberland River in the Mero District</dc:title>
<dc:description>The document is a six page, unnumbered handwritten document found in the "Acts of the Southwest Territory." It is dated September 27, 1794 and signed by Governor William Blount and Secretary David Wilson. On May 26, 1790, President George Washington signed into law an act of Congress passed earlier in the month that established the Territory of the United States South of the River Ohio (Southwest Territory). Embracing the western lands ceded by the state of North Carolina on December 22, 1789, the new territory was to be governed under the terms of the Ordinance of 1787, which created its predecessor, the Northwest Territory.
	The extent of the new territory was well defined. Containing about 43,000 square miles of land, it was restricted to North Carolina&#8217;s western district bounded on the north by the boundary of North Carolina and Virginia; on the west by a line in the middle of the Mississippi River, on the south by the parallel 35 degrees north and on the east by a jagged line running from the northeast to southwest connecting some dominant mountain peaks. It was this territory that in 1796 would become the state of Tennessee.
	The new territory had two centers of population approximately 150 miles apart, separated by the Cumberland Mountains. The larger population, some 28,000, was in the eastern part of the territory in a corridor from 25 to 60 miles wide that extended from the Virginia line down the Holston River Valley about 110 miles to the southwest. Settlements were clustered along the Holston, Watauga, Nolichucky, French Broad and Little Rivers and their tributaries. The smaller Cumberland settlements of approximately 7,000 were located along an 80 mile stretch of the Cumberland River from Bledsoe&#8217;s Lick in the east to Clarksville in the west. The Indians regarded settlements in the Cumberland area and in certain parts of the Holston Valley as encroachments on their territory.

<dc:description>On May 26, 1790, President George Washington signed into law an act of Congress passed earlier in the month that established the Territory of the United States South of the River Ohio (Southwest Territory). Embracing the western lands ceded by the state of North Carolina on December 22, 1789, the new territory was to be governed under the terms of the Ordinance of 1787, which created its predecessor, the Northwest Territory. It was believed that road building was essential for the territory in order to gain statehood. This act, passed September 27, 1794, created a lottery to pay for a wagon road from the Southwest Point to the settlements on the Cumberland River in the Mero District.</dc:description>
