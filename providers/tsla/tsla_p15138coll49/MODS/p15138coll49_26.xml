  <abstract>Mamie Frances Moser Dyche (1888-1971). Born Mamie Moser, she was the eldest of seven children of Reverend John Morgan Moser and Harriet Haffley. In 1910, Mamie Moser married Charlie Boyd Dyche of Sweetwater,Tennessee. Mr. and Mrs. Dyche had seven children: Charlie Boyd (b. 1911), William Harrison (b. 1912), Mamie Frances (b. 1915), Nellie Ruth (b. 1916), Ira Fred (b. 1918), Hattie Mariah (b. 1920), and Nina Mildred (b. 1923). The Dyches made their home on the Dyche Family Farm outside of Philadelphia,Tennessee, living there from 1910 until 1931. By 1931, repeated droughts and the death of Mr. Dycheï¿½s father, William Harrison Dyche, hastened the loss of the farm. At that time the Dyche family moved to Sweetwater, Tennessee.</abstract>
