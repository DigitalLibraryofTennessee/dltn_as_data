  <abstract>Carte de visite of Sojourner Truth.</abstract>
  <abstract>Sojourner Truth was one of the few women to participate in both the abolitionist and women's rights movements. She was born Isabella Baumfree in 1797 in Ulster County, New York. In 1827, she was freed by the New York Gradual Abolition Act. At the time of her emancipation, her former owner, John Dumont, had sold her son Peter to a slave holder in Alabama. She sued in court to have her son returned to her and won making her the first black woman to win such a case against a white man. As a free woman of color, she worked as a domestic in New York City from 1829-1843. Isabella converted to Christianity and, in 1843, she changed her name to Sojourner Truth: "Sojourner because I was to travel up and down the land showing people their sins and being a sign to them, and Truth because I was to declare the truth unto the people." She eventually became a street evangelist, abolitionist, and advocate of women's rights. In 1851 Sojourner Truth delivered her "Ain't I a Woman?" speech at a woman's rights convention in Akron, Ohio. During the Civil War, Sojourner recruited black troops and raised materials and money to help support African American regiments in the Union Army. She died on November 26, 1883 in Battle Creek, Michigan.</abstract>
