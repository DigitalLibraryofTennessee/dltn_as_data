<dc:description>The Japanese style of asymmetrical art was exhibited during the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition of 1876. The "Crazy" quilt pattern cropped up during the Victorian period as a way for women to include the Japanese design they had seen in their quilts. Most Crazy quilts were made with silk, satin, or velvet as opposed to cotton and were only used as display quilts. Crazy quilts can be identified by their uneven fabric blocks and the fine ornamental embroidery stitches on their tops. Photograph belonged to Edna Mays Miracle Liming. Born Sept. 25, 1906 near Cumberland Gap, Tennessee, Edna was the daughter of James Mays and Alice Lawson Mays. The surname of her first husband was Miracle, her daughter Unis Evalyn Miracle died shortly after birth in 1925. Edna later married Homer Liming in Oakland County, Michigan in 1930.</dc:description>
