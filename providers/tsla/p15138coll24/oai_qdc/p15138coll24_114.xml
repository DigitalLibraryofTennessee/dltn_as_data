<dc:description>Portrait of Buck Colbert Franklin, Nashville, Tenn., 1901</dc:description>
<dc:description>Buck Colbert Franklin (1879-1960) grew up on his father's ranch in Indian Territory (what would become Oklahoma in 1907). He began attending Roger Williams University in Nashville and in 1903 he followed his mentor, John Hope, to Atlanta Baptist College (renamed Morehouse College in 1913). Franklin became a lawyer and moved back to Oklahoma, opening a law office in Tulsa one month before the 1921 race riot. Although his law office was destroyed in the riot, he represented African American property owners in lawsuits seeking compensation for the destruction of their businesses and property in the riot. He was also the father of renowned historian John Hope Franklin.</dc:description>
