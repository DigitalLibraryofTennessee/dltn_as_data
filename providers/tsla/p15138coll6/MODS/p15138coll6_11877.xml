  <abstract>Chamberlain wrote to his sister from a Union military prison. "I believe myself friendless because a prison wall divides me from the world. I will let nothing but my [illegible] intentions console me though I die in chains. I am no criminal but choose to differ on what is right and wrong with those who have me in prison." W. F. Chamberlain (1839-1904) enlisted in Co. C, 24th Tenn. Inf. Regt., CSA and was very ill when he left prison. His wife, Laura Street, received a Confederate soldier's pension.</abstract>

Individuals may schedule an appointment, and we will digitally copy and assist in the preservation of your Civil War era manuscripts, artifacts and photographs.
