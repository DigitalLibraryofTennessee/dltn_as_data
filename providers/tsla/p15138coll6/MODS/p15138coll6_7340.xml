  <abstract>"Addie" tells Joseph that she had feared him dead until she heard from him yesterday. His last letter came in February. There are many soldiers returning home, though "they do not love the idea of the rebels [living] around them." She tells him that the; war was not won by lying around, but that it was won by men like him who lent a helping hand. Adaline and Joseph married in 1866. He had deserted a Confederate regiment and joined the 1st Tenn. Cav. Regt, USA in 1862.</abstract>
