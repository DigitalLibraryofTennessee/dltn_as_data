  <abstract>Two North Carolina state notes. One is a 5 dollar note dated 1863. The second note is a 25 cent note dated 1863. Both came through the Cathey family of Haywood County, North Carolina. "Colonel" Cathey operated a general store in the Forks of Pigeon River, NC (current site of Bethel, NC). Cathey served in the North Carolina State Senate in the early 1840s and was a community leader. He was too old for military services in the Civil War but his sons served in the 25th NC Inf. Regt., CSA.</abstract>
