  <abstract>.52 caliber single-shot civilian (sporting) model Sharp's carbine carried by 2nd Lt. Benjamin Keys, Co. G, 60th Tenn. Inf. Regt., CSA. "C. Sharp Patent 1848" is stamped on the metal plate. Keys probably used the weapon after his unit was mounted in 1864. This model used the Maynard tape system for priming. The paper tape held a primer that touched off the round when struck by the hammer. The system worked much like a modern cap pistol. The roll of caps were held within the small door on the lock.</abstract>
