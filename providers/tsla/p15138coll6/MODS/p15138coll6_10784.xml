  <abstract>This issue of Harper's Weekly features a cover image of "Santa Claus in Camp." On pages 8 and 9 of the publication is an engraving of "Christmas Eve 1862" with sentimentalized scenes of a lonely Union soldier on pickett duty gazing at a tintype of wife and children while that same wife prays next to the sleeping children for his safe return. The cover image is of Santa in his sleigh with reindeer and playing with a dancing puppet toy. Pulling the strings made the legs and arms of the puppet flail about.</abstract>
