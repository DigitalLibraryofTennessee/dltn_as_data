  <abstract>This image came from the photographic album of Col. Orlando Poe, who went to West Point with Sanders and wrote on the back of the cdv "Genl. Wm. P. Sanders July 1863, Died Nov. 19, 1863 of wounds received at the siege of Knoxville." Signed "O. M. Poe." Gen. Sanders was mortally on Nov. 18, 1863 and died the next morning. A salient earthen fort was named by Gen. Burnside, at Col. Poe's urging, for Sanders and became the key point in the repulse of Gen. Longstreet's Confederates on November 29, 1863.</abstract>

    <abstract>To commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Civil War (2011-2015), the Tennessee State Library and Archives is sending teams of archivists and conservators to communities across Tennessee. Individuals may schedule an appointment, and we will digitally copy and assist in the preservation of your Civil War era manuscripts, artifacts and photographs. Digital copies of these items, representing the rich Civil War heritage of Tennessee families, will become part of a virtual exhibit commemorating the 150th anniversary of the war in Tennessee....</abstract>
