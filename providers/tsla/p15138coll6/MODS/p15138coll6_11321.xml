In this letter he relates, "Tom and I was at Newbern (sic) the other day and I had my picture taken and I just came of (sic) picket-and you must execuse the ugly looks for it is not taken good" He asks that his mother send him a photograph as he misses her. He asks that they save him some chestnuts and hickory nuts.</abstract>
