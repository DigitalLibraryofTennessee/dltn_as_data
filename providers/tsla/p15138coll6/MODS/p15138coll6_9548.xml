  <abstract>Mary Austin Pitt made this soldier's housewife for her husband, Pvt. Henry Pitt, Co. B, 7th Tenn. Cav, CSA. Made of cotton, green silk, and red wool, it contained two small leather purses, a tintype of Henry Pitt (hayw098), and a mourning tintype of Mary; Austin Pitt and their deceased baby, John (hayw017). The excellent condition of the housewife indicates he never received it. Pvt. Pitt served under Gen. Nathan B. Forrest and died of wounds received at the Battle of Brice's Crossroads, Miss. in 1864.</abstract>
