  <abstract>Cpl. Henry M. Misemer states that they are camped within one mile of the State Capitol in Nashville. He also states that his brother in-law, Sol, is in a Nashville hospital with dropsy, and that there was a big battle at Vicksburg that is still going on. Misemer also says they waste more provisions there than the rebels get and gives a list of foods that they have received. For the entire collection of letters, see TSLA Mf.#2008, the Henry Marshall Misemer Civil War Letters.</abstract>
