  <abstract>Capt. Norris speaks of the aftermath of the Battle of Fredericksburg and wounds and casualties at the Battle of Seven Pines. "The result of both battles was a victory on our side much more decisive however in the last fight than in that of Seven Pines." Says: "They are calling for 300,000 more troops but cannot I think raise them except by draft and soldiers of that kind are not worth much." Says Northern newspapers "acknowledge the folly of tryingï¿½to subjugate the South."</abstract>

    <abstract>To commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Civil War (2011-2015), the Tennessee State Library and Archives is sending teams of archivists and conservators to communities across Tennessee. Individuals may schedule an appointment, and we will digitally copy and assist in the preservation of your Civil War era manuscripts, artifacts and photographs.
