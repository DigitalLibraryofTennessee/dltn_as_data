  <abstract>The .44 caliber model 1858 Remington "Army" Revolver was the second most commonly encountered pistol of the Civil War. The spring loaded latch for the loading lever is missing from this example. It appears that the grips have been slightly carved along; the bottom. This seems to have been done to allow for a laynard to be attached. A few period photographs show soldiers with laynards attached to pistols to enable them to recover the pistol if dropped while on horseback.</abstract>
