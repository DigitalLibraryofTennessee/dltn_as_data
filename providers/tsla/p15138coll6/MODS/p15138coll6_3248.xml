  <abstract>Silver platter, dated December 25, 1870. It was given to the Reverend Richard Riley Evans (1818-1903) by Germantown (Shelby County) Presbyterian Church. The Reverend Evans saved the church building from being burned during the Civil War. It is said that because he was a member of the Masons and the Union officer was also a Mason, the Union troops were persuaded to not burn the church. Richard Riley Evans's wife was Margaret Wilson Evans.</abstract>
