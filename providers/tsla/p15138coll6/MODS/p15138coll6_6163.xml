  <abstract>Confederate $100 bill depicting Lucy Holocombe Pickens. Lucy Holcombe Pickens was born on June 11, 1832, near LaGrange (Fayette County), Tenn. She married Col. Francis Wilkinson Pickens on April 26, 1858. Her husband was the US ambassador to Russia. Lucy supported secession and helped the Confederate cause by selling jewels, given to her by the Russian tsar, to buy supplies and equipment for the Confederates. She is the only woman to be depicted on CSA currency. The bill was found by Suzy Wardlaw in a roll of Confederate bills that her father, Rayden Wardlaw, brought home from the war. Family lore suggests that Rayden Wardlaw enlisted in the CSA in Mississippi.</abstract>
