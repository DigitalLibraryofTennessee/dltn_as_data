  <abstract>Cased daguerreotype of William D. Womack. Womack, from Warren County, was a private in Co. A, 35th Tenn. Inf. Regt., CSA. He was 19 when he joined the Army in 1862. Womack lost his left hand and left eye at Shiloh and was discharged because of his severe injuries. Family historian states that after Womack re-entered civilian life, he was sent to the prisons at Camp Chase, Ohio, and Point Lookout, Md. Conditions at Point Lookout were wretched. Womack married Melissa Jane Turner. He died in 1914.</abstract>
