  <abstract>This note signed by H. A. Garrett of Co. B promising to pay $12 to J.N. Shoun, sutler of the 13th Tenn. Cav. Regt., USA, a regiment composed largely of men from Carter County. Sutlers were licensed by the Army to travel along with and sell sundry items to soldiers, usually at highly inflated prices. Sutlers allowed soldiers to purchase on credit payable upon pay day. The sutler presented the statements of each soldier to the paymaster who then deducted the amount from the soldier's pay.</abstract>
