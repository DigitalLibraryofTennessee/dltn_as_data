  <abstract>CSA Gen. George Washington Gordon, imprisoned at Ft. Warren, Mass., writes to his cousin Andrew at Johnson's Island Prison in Ohio. He has not heard from friends in Tennessee, but expects to daily. The general sends best wishes to Andrew's roommates, and says "that I shall cherish a grateful recollection of their past kindnesses." G. W. Gordon joined the 11th Tenn. Inf. Regt., CSA, as a drillmaster. After the war, he became a member of the KKK and was elected to the Tennessee General Assembly.</abstract>

    <abstract>To commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Civil War (2011-2015), the Tennessee State Library and Archives is sending teams of archivists and conservators to communities across Tennessee. Individuals may schedule an appointment, and we will digitally copy and assist in the preservation of your Civil War era manuscripts, artifacts and photographs. Digital copies of these items, representing the rich Civil War heritage of Tennessee families, will become part of a virtual exhibit commemorating the 150th anniversary of the war in Tennessee....</abstract>
