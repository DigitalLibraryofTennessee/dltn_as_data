  <abstract>This item was used during the Civil War by John B. W. Bond who was a member of Co. A, 35th Tenn. Inf. (5th Tenn. Regt., Prov. Army Mountain Rifle Regt." CSA. The item is a combination spoon/fork utensil, and may have been used in the Shelton's Hill area of Northern Mississippi. There is a slight indentation on the spoon where a bullet may have struck him, possibly saving his life. He was wounded and hospitalized at the Battle of Chickamauga, then returned to the unit after his recovery.</abstract>
