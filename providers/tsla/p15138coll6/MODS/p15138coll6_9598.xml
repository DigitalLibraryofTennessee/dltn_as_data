  <abstract>Thomas H. Hill, Secretary of the Sequachee Valley Coal and Iron Company, was a Union Army Major from Massachussets who settled in Sequatchie, Tennessee. On the back of his company's flyer, he wrote a speech to a meeting of the Grand Army of the Republic. Speech refers to General Ulysses Grant ordering at the Surrender of Vicksburg "Instruct the commands to be orderly and quick as these prisoners pass to make no offensive remarks." He goes on to talk about the responsibilities of the GAR.</abstract>
