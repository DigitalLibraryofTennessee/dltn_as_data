  <abstract>This letter was written by Pvt. Sumner F. Slaton, Co. K, 21st Ky. Inf. Regt., USA to his mother Frances L. Slaton in Hopkinsville, Ky. Pvt. Slaton was hired as a substitute for a man who had been drafted. Slaton discusses the fall of Charleston, SC and "our flag is also floating over fort (sic) Sumter." His letter anticipates the ultimate capitulation of the Confederacy and his return home to Kentucky. Slaton died May 24, 1865 of "chronic diarrhea" in a field hospital near Nashville, Tennessee.</abstract>
