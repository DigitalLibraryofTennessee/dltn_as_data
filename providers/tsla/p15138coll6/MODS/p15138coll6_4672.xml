  <abstract>This rifle was manufactured for the Confederate Army at the Pulaski Armory by W. N. Webb, N. B. Zuccarello and James McLean. While the barrel was new, some of the parts were repurposed from other weapons. "Pulaski C. S. A. 61" is engraved on the barrel. The armory stopped production when Federal army took Pulaski. Converted flintlock to percussion firing. Only about 300 Pulaski Rifles were made and only a few are known to have survived.</abstract>
