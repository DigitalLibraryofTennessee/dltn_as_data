  <abstract>Mounted dragoon saber with scabbard. It has a tempered steel blade and 3-branch brass hilt. The grip is leather-wrapped wood, and the blade is marked "N P Ames, Cutler, Springfield [Mass.], 1836." It is stamped with an inspector's mark, "JM." Blade is engraved with leaves, and "United States" is written in cursive. The saber was an 1836 standard issue, and would have been used during the Mexican War (1846-1847).</abstract>

    <abstract>To commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Civil War (2011-2015), the Tennessee State Library and Archives is sending teams of archivists and conservators to communities across Tennessee. Individuals may schedule an appointment, and we will digitally copy and assist in the preservation of your Civil War era manuscripts, artifacts and photographs.
