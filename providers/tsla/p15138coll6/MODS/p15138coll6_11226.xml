  <abstract>Based in Knoxville, these notes from the Bank of East Tennessee had to be dated and signed by the cashier and bank officers to be valid. One has not been signed and therefore was not issued. Such bank notes were the only extant form of paper currency before the war and the issuance of legal tender "greenbacks" by President Lincoln's Federal government as a Civil War financial measure.</abstract>

    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>To commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Civil War (2011-2015), the Tennessee State Library and Archives is sending teams of archivists and conservators to communities across Tennessee. Individuals may schedule an appointment, and we will digitally copy and assist in the preservation of your Civil War era manuscripts, artifacts and photographs. Digital copies of these items, representing the rich Civil War heritage of Tennessee families, will become part of a virtual exhibit commemorating the 150th anniversary of the war in Tennessee....</abstract>
