  <abstract>The cartridges on each end are for the Spencer rifle or carbine. The Spencer was one of, if not the most, technologically advanced weapons of the Civil War. The 56-50 caliber weapon used a metallic cartridge that held a powder charge and a primer. The weapons was magazine fed, repeating rifle which also came in a shorter carbine length. Both weapons were widely used by the Union. The center cartridge was for the Maynard carbine which was a single shot, breech loader used by both sides.</abstract>
