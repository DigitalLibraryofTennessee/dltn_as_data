  <abstract>Found in an attic in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the sword was engraved to "Lt. E. Caufy" in September 1861. Lt. Edward Caufy was a railroad conductor who served in Co. F, 26th Mass. Inf., USA. Promoted to captain in Feb. 1863, he mustered out in Nov. 1864. He died in Dec. 1914 at the home of his son Luther in Milwaukee. The blade indicates that it was probably an 1850 foot officer's sword of Union manufacture, but the sword has a cavalry guard and grip, perhaps added after the war.</abstract>
