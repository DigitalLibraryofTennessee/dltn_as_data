  <abstract>Alfred Eugene Jackson was born in Davidson County, Tennessee and attended Washington and Greeneville College in Greene County, Tenn. He took up farming in East Tenn. as well as dealing in produce and manufactured goods. He joined the Confederate cause and rose to the rank of brigadier general and served in the Department of East Tenn. The war left Jackson impoverished and he went back to farming. He was pardoned by Pres. Johnson and his estate was returned to him. He died in Jonesboro, Tenn. in 1889.</abstract>

    <abstract>To commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Civil War (2011-2015), the Tennessee State Library and Archives is sending teams of archivists and conservators to communities across Tennessee. Individuals may schedule an appointment, and we will digitally copy and assist in the preservation of your Civil War era manuscripts, artifacts and photographs. Digital copies of these items, representing the rich Civil War heritage of Tennessee families, will become part of a virtual exhibit commemorating the 150th anniversary of the war in Tennessee....</abstract>
