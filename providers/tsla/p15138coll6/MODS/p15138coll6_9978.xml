  <abstract>Written from George W. Hamner on April 2, 1863 to a friend Jinnie, he relates "our brigade under General Forrest made a dash on the Yanks the 26th, between Nashville and Franklin, capturing between five and seven hundred, besides their guns, blankets and oil cloths and everything good to eat we found in their camp." He comments that "paper is scarce," having written the letter on stationery captured in the raid.</abstract>

    <abstract>To commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Civil War (2011-2015), the Tennessee State Library and Archives is sending teams of archivists and conservators to communities across Tennessee. Individuals may schedule an appointment, and we will digitally copy and assist in the preservation of your Civil War era manuscripts, artifacts and photographs. Digital copies of these items, representing the rich Civil War heritage of Tennessee families, will become part of a virtual exhibit commemorating the 150th anniversary of the war in Tennessee....</abstract>
