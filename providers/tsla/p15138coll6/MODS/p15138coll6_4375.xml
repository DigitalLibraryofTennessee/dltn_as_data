  <abstract>Photograph of Pinewood Mansion, which was built from 1866 to 1868. The house was built by Samuel Graham, who left North Carolina in 1832 and eventually settled in Hickman County. The Pinewood Plantation was established in 1848 as a mill site. During the Civil War the site was subject to both Confederate and Union raids. The purpose of the raids was to obtain goods produced in the mills. The mansion burned in 1975. See Tennessee Historical Quarterly 27, No. 1, Spring 1968, Pinewood article.</abstract>
