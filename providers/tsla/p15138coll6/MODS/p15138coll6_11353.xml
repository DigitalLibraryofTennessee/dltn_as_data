  <abstract>DeLany describes the Carolinas Campaigns and states that he is "both alive, well in mind and body." Foragers from Sherman's column were often easy targets for the Confederate cavalry. DeLany wrote, "Mc. Young is missing-supposed to have been killed while foraging." Sherman's men in the Caraolinas lived off the land and ate well but suffered for clothing. He writes, "men are in excellent spirits-tho' badly off for clothing-shoes &amp; pants particularly, many are barefooted."</abstract>

    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>To commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Civil War (2011-2015), the Tennessee State Library and Archives is sending teams of archivists and conservators to communities across Tennessee. Individuals may schedule an appointment, and we will digitally copy and assist in the preservation of your Civil War era manuscripts, artifacts and photographs. Digital copies of these items, representing the rich Civil War heritage of Tennessee families, will become part of a virtual exhibit commemorating the 150th anniversary of the war in Tennessee....</abstract>
