  <abstract>These tongs were recovered from the area near Lamb's Ferry on the Tennessee River in Lawrence County, Tennessee. The tongs may have been used to remove heated iron cannon shot from a furnace. Hot shot was used to attack wooden vessels and masted ships. Most hot shot tongs of the period have a wooden or leather handle to prevent the inducted heat from the cannonball from burning the artillery crewmen.</abstract>
