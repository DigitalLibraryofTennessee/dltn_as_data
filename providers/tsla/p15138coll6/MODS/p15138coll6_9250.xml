  <abstract>Grave maker of General James G. Spears of the Union Army. Buried in Pikeville, Tenn. Spears had fought in the Mexican War and had been a prominent Unionist in Bledsoe County. He achieved the rank of brigadier general in the Union army, but his vocal opposition to Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation and the abolitionist turn of the war led to him being court-martialed and cashiered from the military. His wife Adeline is buried here, too. Her epitaph: "She hath done the best she could."</abstract>
