  <abstract>Drawing of soldiers done in Chattanooga by Pvt. James Long, Co. E, 5th Ky. Cav., USA. Artist inscribed "J. Long 1863" in lower right hand corner. Long enlisted in the 5th Ky. Cav., USA in Burkesville, Kentucky in 1862. Records indicate that he was captured near Chattanooga on Oct. 2, 1863, but he writes letters that contradict that information. He was paroled and exchanged through Savannah, Georgia in Nov. 1864 and returned to his regiment. He was mustered out at Columbus, Ohio in March 1865.</abstract>
