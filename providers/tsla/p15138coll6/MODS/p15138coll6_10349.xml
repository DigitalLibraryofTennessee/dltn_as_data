  <abstract>Pvt. Wilson T. McCoglan served with Co. E, 8th Tenn. Inf. Regt., CSA., a regiment organized at Camp Trousdale of upper Cumberland Plateau men. Having served initially with Gen. Lee in Virginia, the unit in 1862 was sent west to join the Army of Tennessee where it campaigned for the remainder of the war. McClogan received a medical discharge from the regiment in December 1861. He suffered from "Brights Disease of the kidney." This is a post Civil War image of the former soldier.</abstract>

    <abstract>To commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Civil War (2011-2015), the Tennessee State Library and Archives is sending teams of archivists and conservators to communities across Tennessee. Individuals may schedule an appointment, and we will digitally copy and assist in the preservation of your Civil War era manuscripts, artifacts and photographs. Digital copies of these items, representing the rich Civil War heritage of Tennessee families, will become part of a virtual exhibit commemorating the 150th anniversary of the war in Tennessee....</abstract>
