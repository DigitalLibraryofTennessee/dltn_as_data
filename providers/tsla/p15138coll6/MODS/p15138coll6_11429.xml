  <abstract>Court case involving slave (later free person of color) Nancy Bayless, manumitted with her husband Oliver by former owner Sarah Bayless, who was secretly a member of the American Colonization Society and who desired that her ex-slaves emigrate to Liberia. Sarah Bayless' 1853 will freed all of her slaves, numbering in the dozens, incl. Nancy, though she apparently did not provide them with the funds to leave the state. Under terms of an 1850s Tennessee law, Nancy is now petitioning to be re-enslaved.</abstract>
