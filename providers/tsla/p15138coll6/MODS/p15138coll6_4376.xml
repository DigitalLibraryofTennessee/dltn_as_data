  <abstract>Photograph of the Pinewood Plantation cotton mill. In the center front are two sisters, Attie Griffin and Mattie McCaleb. The Pinewood cotton mill was established by S. L. Graham, who moved to Hickman County from North Carolina. He began his career as a merchant and tailor, but eventually became a successful and wealthy industrialist. The factory was established in 1848 and was the origin and center of the village of Pinewood. See Tennessee Historical Quarterly 27, No. 1, Spring 1968, Pinewood article.</abstract>
