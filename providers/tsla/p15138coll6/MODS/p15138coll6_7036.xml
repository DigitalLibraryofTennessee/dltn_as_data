  <abstract>Hand-tinted studio image of Pvt. Henry Monger and his 13-year old son, trumpeter Wright T. Monger, both in Co. G, 3rd Tenn. Cav., USA. Wearing Federal sack coats and wide-brimmed hats, Wright held a Colt Navy revolver and Henry a Remington revolver. They enlisted in July 1863, went missing in action in September 1864. Henry's rank was reduced from Sgt. To Pvt. On March 1, 1865. Wright's certificate of disability noted his "youth and small stature" and that he "had not been able learn to play the bugle."</abstract>
