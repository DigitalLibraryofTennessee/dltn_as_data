  <abstract>This .69 caliber French Model 1816 musket was made in St. Blasien, Germany and later converted to percussion. It was carried by Edmund Jameson, Co.F, 149th Ill. Inf. "1854" is stamped on the stock along with "1819". Also stamped on the stock is "0&amp;MRRC." Jameson worked as a blacksmith after the war and was the last living member of the G.A.R. in Dearborn Co., Ind. The musket was passed down through the soldier's family. The 149th Ill. served as provost guard around Chattanooga and Atlanta in 1864-65.</abstract>
