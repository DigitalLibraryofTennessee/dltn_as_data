  <abstract>According to descendants this is a tintype of Joseph Dixon Pickett. He is shown wearing a US issued jacket, a US saber belt, and holding a Colt revolver. No records for a Joseph Dixon Pickett were located. However, a John D. Pickett served in Co. F, 7th Tenn. Cav., USA. The 7th was composed of Union men from West Tennessee which is where this image was found. John D. Pickett was captured at Trenton, Tenn. in Dec. 1863 and died at Camp Chase, Ohio in March 1863. His brother was William Raford Pickett.</abstract>
