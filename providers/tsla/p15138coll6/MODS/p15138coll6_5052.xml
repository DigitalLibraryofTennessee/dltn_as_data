  <abstract>Pvt. J. T. Bass, Co. C., 4th (McLemore's) Cav., CSA, wrote to his wife that his eyes were sore and he "aint been clear of the bowel complaint." He said that they only received half rations. He described action at Brentwood, Tennessee where they had "seen the monkey" and took 650 prisoners and several wagons. Bass "toted" one of Yankee prisoners across the river because he felt sorry for him. Bass wanted to kiss his children and buy some calico for his wife, signing as "your best friend until death."</abstract>
