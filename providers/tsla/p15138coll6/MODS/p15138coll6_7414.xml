  <abstract>Patience tells her uncle that she hopes the rebs "all git out of hear and I hope that wont be long." She says that home folks can't see anything but "the gray backs a hunting for something to eat." All the boys are gone to war, so "you could have pickling; choice among the girls." Patience is tired of this "unholy war," and she asks her uncle to give her love and respects to all the Yankee boys. Joseph Napoleon Bonaparte Lusk deserted the CSA in 1862 and enlisted in the 7th E. Tenn. Inf. Regt., USA.</abstract>
