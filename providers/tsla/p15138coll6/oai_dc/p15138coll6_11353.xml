<dc:title>Letter written by Cyrus M. DeLany, Co. B, 30th Ohio Inf. Regt., USA</dc:title>
<dc:description>DeLany describes the Carolinas Campaigns and states that he is "both alive, well in mind and body." Foragers from Sherman's column were often easy targets for the Confederate cavalry. DeLany wrote, "Mc. Young is missing-supposed to have been killed while foraging." Sherman's men in the Caraolinas lived off the land and ate well but suffered for clothing. He writes, "men are in excellent spirits-tho' badly off for clothing-shoes &amp; pants particularly, many are barefooted."</dc:description>
