<dc:title>Antebellum Bank of East Tennessee bank notes</dc:title>
<dc:description>Based in Knoxville, these notes from the Bank of East Tennessee had to be dated and signed by the cashier and bank officers to be valid. One has not been signed and therefore was not issued. Such bank notes were the only extant form of paper currency before the war and the issuance of legal tender "greenbacks" by President Lincoln's Federal government as a Civil War financial measure.</dc:description>
