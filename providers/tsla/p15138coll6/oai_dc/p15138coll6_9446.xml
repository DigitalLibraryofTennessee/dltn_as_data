<dc:title>Letter from James B. Owen to Sarah (Sally) Bell</dc:title>
<dc:description>Letter from Pvt. James B. Owen, Co. D, 31st Ill. Inf. Regt., USA to Sarah Bell. He writes that he has not heard from neither her nor his father, despite his having written six letters to them. He has heard "talk of peace" and; while he does not know if it's reliable he hopes for an agreement to be made. Sara Bell was the daughter of William Bell, the founder of Bells, Tenn. Owen was from Brownsville, Ill. and died Sept. 3, 1863.</dc:description>
