<dc:title>Letter from G. W. Gordon to Capt. A. R. Gordon</dc:title>
<dc:description>CSA Gen. George Washington Gordon writes from confinement at Ft. Warren, Mass., to his cousin Andrew, imprisoned at Johnson's Island, Ohio. He mentions the "President's Proclamation" and explains why he will make a special application for amnesty. [Pres. Andrew Johnson had made the amnesty proclamation just days before, but it excluded the wealthy classes.] G. W. Gordon joined the 11th Tenn. Inf. Regt., CSA, as a drillmaster. He later became a member of the KKK and was elected to Tenn. General Assembly.</dc:description>
