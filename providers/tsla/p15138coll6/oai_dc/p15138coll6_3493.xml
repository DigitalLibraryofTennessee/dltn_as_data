<dc:title>Non-military bag</dc:title>
<dc:description>Non-military bag that could have been used during the Civil War and hooked onto a horse's saddle. The item was carried by Jackson Green from Luther, Hancock County, Tennessee. He was in Co. B, 1st Regt., Tenn. Vol. Cav., USA. Some of the bag is hand stitched and other parts are machine stitched. The item was definitely not military issued, but may still have been used in the war.</dc:description>
