<dc:title>Letter from Pvt. William Burton to James R. and Elizabeth Burton</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pvt. William Burton, 2nd Ky. Cav., USA, wrote to his parents from Camp Joe Holt, Clark Co., Ind. He said that he was well, but upset about how some "rascal" had treated his wife. He asked his father to prosecute the man to the fullest extent of the law so that he will never treat another woman that way. William also wanted to know if the rascal got out on bail. If so, Burton would ask for furlough and return to kill him. He asked his mother to help take care of his children.</dc:description>
