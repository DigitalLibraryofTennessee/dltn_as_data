<dc:title>Letter of M. C. Callahan to Cynthia Swann</dc:title>
<dc:description>Matthias C. Callahan, 121st Ohio Vol. Inf. Regt. (Opdycke Tigers), writes to the daughter Cynthia of a Dandridge family who took him in after he was wounded in fighting and cared for by the family. He eventually escaped capture by Confederates and re-joined unit, though he carried ball. He describes "colored man" applying "mush poultice" and mother not caring "which side whips if they will just leave her alone." Interestingly, he inquires after prospects of timber business in Jefferson County.</dc:description>
