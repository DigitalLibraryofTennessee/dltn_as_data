<dc:title>US Model 1840 non-commissioned officers sword</dc:title>
<dc:description>This US Model 1840 NCO sword was found in an old house in Sweden's Cove, Marion County, Tennessee. There were multiple skirmishes in Sweden's Cove beginning in the summer of 1862 until later in 1864. The NCO sword was supposed to be issued to every sergeant and corporal in the Federal infantry. The practice was inconsistently followed and many NCOs ditched the items as being unnecessary.</dc:description>
