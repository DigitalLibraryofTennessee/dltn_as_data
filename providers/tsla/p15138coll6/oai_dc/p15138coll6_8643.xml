<dc:title>Contract between mistress and her former slaves</dc:title>
<dc:description>Contract signed by former Caruthers slaves--Thomas, Rhoda, Harriet, &amp; Dempsey--releasing "our former mistress," Francis Caruthers, from paying for any further expenses for their care now that they are free. Release is made "in consideration of the care; and attention exercised over us and our families and the maintenance of the same by our former mistress since colored people have had a right to contract for themselves." The parties were all from Obion County, Tennessee from the area around Troy.</dc:description>
