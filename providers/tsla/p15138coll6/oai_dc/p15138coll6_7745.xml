<dc:title>Letter from Capt. Archibald D. Norris, Co. K, 7th Tenn. Inf. Regt., CSA to "My Dear Uncle and Aunt"</dc:title>
<dc:description>Written from Big Spring, Virginia, Capt. Archibald D. Norris, Co. K, 7th Tenn. Inf. Regt., CSA talks of the dullness of camp life. He has "a good supply of Irish potatoes and sweet milk. In short we live like kings&#65533;". He fishes from local streams and sees; deer and turkey. Norris also asks "Aunt Betty" to assist his father with procuring his winter clothing and boots. He suggests getting his overcoat made at "Haines as many of our company are having theirs made there".</dc:description>
