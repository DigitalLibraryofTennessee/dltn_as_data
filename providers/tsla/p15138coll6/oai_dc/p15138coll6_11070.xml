<dc:title>Letter written by Pvt. Benjamin Allen, Co. D, 8th Tenn. Inf. Regt., USA to his wife, Martha (Marthy)</dc:title>
<dc:description>Many Tennesseans fled East Tennessee to enlist in Federal regiments recruiting in Kentucky. Benjamin Allen of Hawkins County, Tennessee made it to Camp Dick Robinson and enlisted in Co. D, 8th Tenn. Inf. Regt., USA. In his letter to his wife Martha he describes life in the camps, mentions that he had heard that Vicksburg had fallen (it had not), and encourages more Tennesseans to enlist. He derides the head doctor for being a Kentuckian. Allen died of typhoid fever at the camp on July 6, 1863.</dc:description>
