<dc:title>Letter from Pvt. James E. Ballard to family</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pvt. James E. Ballard, Co. A, 11th Miss. Inf., CSA, wrote to his family, with a separate note for his younger sisters asking about their schooling. If he "should happen to get back home" he wanted to have hog meat, cornbread, potatoes and milk. His description of "Camp Fisher" included thoughts on paper money, food, clothing and weather. He closed with "Give my love to white &amp; black." The envelope has a June 5 Richmond, Va. postmark. Ballard died at the Battle of Gettysburg on July 3, 1863.</dc:description>
