<dc:title>Letter from Cpl. Henry Marshall Misemer, Co. F, 3rd Tenn. Cav. Regt., USA, to wife Martha</dc:title>
<dc:description>Misemer explains in his letter that they have 815 men and it takes a 1000 to make a regiment. He worries that "we will never have enough men because they die as fast as we recruit" them. Although "I want to see you verry [sic] bad," he cautions his wife about a plan to have wives visit their camp. He also asks for new pairs of socks.
