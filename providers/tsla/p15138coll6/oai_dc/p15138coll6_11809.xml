<dc:title>Ledger/Diary</dc:title>
<dc:description>Leather-bound combination ledger and diary opens with a list of J. B. McEwen's paid accounts. The diary portion tells of the days leading up to and during the Battle of Nashville. McEwen recounts walking across the battlefield and witnessing the wrenching sight of the dead. "Dead men and horses were lying together in a heap, some of the former with ghastly staring eyes." Several were frozen in the act of leveling their rifles to fire. "Oh! it was a dreadful sickening sight&#8230;."</dc:description>
