<dc:title>1840 presidential campaign button for William Henry Harrison</dc:title>
<dc:description>Campaign medallion for Major General William Henry Harrison, during the presidential election of 1840. The front of the medallion says he was "born February 8, 1773." The reverse of the medallion says "The People's Choice in the Year 1840" and features a log cabin. That he was born in a log cabin was a hallmark of Harrison's "Tippecanoe &amp; Tyler Too" campaign. According to the donor, it was found in a box belonging to Benjamin Brasell, a Spanish-American War veteran.</dc:description>
