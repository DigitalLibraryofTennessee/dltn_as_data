<dc:title>Confederate cavalry saber and scabbard</dc:title>
<dc:description>The orange color of the brass fixtures and hilt on this saber, caused by the high copper content in the metal, indicate Confederate origins. Carried by Benjamin Keys, Co. G, 60th Mtd. Inf. Regt.,CSA. Keys and his unit were captured at Vicksburg in 1863. After being exchanged the regiment was given horses and redesignated "Mounted Infantry." They served in East Tenn. for much of the war. Keys survived the war, died in 1900 and is buried in Gunnings Cemetery in Blountville, Tenn.</dc:description>
