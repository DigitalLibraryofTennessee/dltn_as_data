<dc:title>Letter of Alonzo Swift, Co. E, 137th N.Y. Inf. Regt., USA</dc:title>
<dc:description>Alonzo Swift served as a teamster and wrote this letter to his wife. The soldier expresses his thankfulness that his wife, who was apparently sick, was trusting in "the Great Jehovan the Mighty God of Jacob." He also shares with her the news that Philo is dead and is concerned how his wife and parents will bear the news. At the time of the letter, the 137th New York was entrenched just outside Atlanta as part of the 20th Army Corps. The regiment marched into the city around midnight September 3, 1864.</dc:description>
