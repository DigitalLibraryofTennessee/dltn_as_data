<dc:title>Letter from Tom Hord to Amelia Hord</dc:title>
<dc:description>Upon returning to their home at Cherry Flat, Hord wrote to his wife, telling her that things were "as usual" at home. He described the journey from New Orleans through Jackson, Miss. and Jackson, Tenn. "I got to the Boro, all well. Our union friends about town were jubilant about their late victory; the union majority was over sixty four thousand," referring to the February vote on the secession convention he mentioned in his previous letter. He signed the letter "your very affectionate Old Man."</dc:description>
