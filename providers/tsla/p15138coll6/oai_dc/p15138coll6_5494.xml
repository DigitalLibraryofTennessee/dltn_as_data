<dc:title>Letter on the Oregon Trail from Lewis Rhea and May E. Rhea to William Rhea</dc:title>
<dc:description>Lewis Rhea wrote to his brother from Ft. Kearney while traveling cross country to Oregon. He heard that more than 2,300 wagons had passed. Rhea wrote "this country beats all for wind an storms   rainge pitch forks an buffalow." He mentioned sport with buffalo and antelope and noted that the "helth on the Plains is very good." Rhea longed for letters from home and, if he lived, would write again at Ft. Laramie. He asks them to "escuse my bade riting the wagon is a boute to blow over."</dc:description>
