<dc:title>Spout from a shot charger</dc:title>
<dc:description>This spout is from a shot charger for a shotgun. It does not have the leather pouch, though there is a remnant still attached. It belonged to Jefferson Casey Savage of Hardeman County, Tenn. According to family records, Savage joined Capt. Wilson's company in 1862, then transferred to Capt. Wiley Higgs' 2nd Co. K, 3rd (Forrest's Old) Tenn. Cav., CSA, formerly Higgs' Independent Scouts. Savage took the oath of allegiance to the United States and gave a $2000 bond on August 19, 1862.</dc:description>
