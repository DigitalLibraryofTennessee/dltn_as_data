<dc:title>Letter from Capt. Jim W. Irwin to Baxter Porter</dc:title>
<dc:description>Capt. J. W. Irwin, 1st Tenn. Cav, CSA in "Braggs Army" wrote that he was glad to learn of Baxter's recovery from his "frightful wound." Irwin lists the situations of several officers, some still prisoners. He said Baxter was right to "take Surgeon's Certificate" of disability and to stay home until well. Irwin still reported Baxter as "absent sick." He advised Baxter's father to stay because the "Tories" were expected back in Hardin Co. soon, and they had killed Tom Darby.</dc:description>
