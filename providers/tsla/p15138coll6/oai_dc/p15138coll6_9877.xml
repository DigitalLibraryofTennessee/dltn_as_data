<dc:title>Wallpaper edition of Vicksburg Daily Citizen, July 2, 1863</dc:title>
<dc:description>Sgt. Charles Ward, Co. E. 60th Ind. Inf. Regt., USA, took part in the siege of Vicksburg and brought back this newspaper, dated two days before the town's surrender. By that time, the residents were subsisting on mule meat and using wallpaper to print newspapers, lacking newsprint. Sgt. Ward witnessed a last note added to the "cold type" by a Union soldier after the fall of Vicksburg on July 4, 1863. Newspaper preserved by descendants in Evansville, Ind.
