<dc:title>Cook and Brothers .58 caliber infantry rifle</dc:title>
<dc:description>This rifle was manufactured by Cook and Brothers of Athens, Ga. It has a full-length barrel and no cartouche. An image of the first national Confederate flag is engraved to the left of the pin. The barrel may have been replaced. The rifle appears to be modeled after the British Enfield. The company was originally located in New Orleans, but had to move to Athens, Ga., during the war.</dc:description>
