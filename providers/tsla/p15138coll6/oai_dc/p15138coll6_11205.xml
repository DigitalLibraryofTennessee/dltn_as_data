<dc:title>Dance card from a Confederate military ball held in Knoxville</dc:title>
<dc:description>Given by the Knoxviile Guards, which became Co. E, 19th Tenn. Inf. Regt. CSA., this "Military Ball" was held at the Lamar House which still stands in Knoxville. This dance card may have belonged to Miss A. P. Shilds whose name is written on the front. In addition to Floor Managers and Managers whose names are printed on the front (several became officers in this unit), on the back are hand-written "Recollections of names"-possibly female attendees. Held right after Tennessee voters rejected secession.</dc:description>
