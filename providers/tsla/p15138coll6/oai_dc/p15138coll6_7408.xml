<dc:title>Letter from Adaline Davis to J. N. B. Lusk</dc:title>
<dc:description>"Addie" teases her soldier beau Joseph about not enjoying himself "up there with the company you have." She advises him to make the best of it and says that much awaits him at home. Adaline reports that "all the boys has gone off to the war," and she; hopes for their safe return. In the next sentence, she doubts they all will come home, but that she will see them in a better world. Though she and Joseph are many miles apart, "I hope our hearts are entwined around each other&#65533;."</dc:description>
