<dc:title>Polly Kelly's Civil War widow pension application</dc:title>
<dc:description>Based on her husband Daniel Kelly's service in Co. H, 8th Tenn. Inf. Regt., USA, Polly is receiving an $8/month pension for Pvt. Kelly's service, commencing in September of 1864. He apparently died during the war, as the pension is effective with the war still going on. Receipts for payment of the pension had to be signed in the presence of the magistrate or pension agent. Kelly was captured at Bull's Gap, Tenn. April 5, 1864 and died as a prisoner of war at Andersonville Sept. 17, 1864.</dc:description>
