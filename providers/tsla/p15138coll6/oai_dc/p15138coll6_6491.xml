<dc:title>Handwritten recruitment flyer from Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest</dc:title>
<dc:description>Handwritten letter from Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest to the citizens of Columbia and Maury County. States "I call upon you to volunteer for service in the Rifle pits around the town. Let every man disposed to cooperate with the Confederate forces in and near Columbia, leave his name with the Commandant of the Post, and let such volunteers, at an early day meet and elect their officers. I have arms enough for all whose patriotism may move them to heed this call." Probably signed by an aide.</dc:description>
