<dc:title>Letter from T.C. (Thomas Crutchfield)</dc:title>
<dc:description>This letter is from Thomas Crutchfield to his uncle. Crutchfield owned a sizeable farm known as the River Farm near Chattanooga, Tenn. Crutchfield is clearly frustrated with the destruction of his property during the war. He writes of concern for his wife and family, great dissatisfaction in the army and the bombardment at Fort Wagner at Morris Island. He also discusses the potential moves of the Federal Armies under Grant. Crutchfield was the original owner of the Read House in Chattanooga.</dc:description>
