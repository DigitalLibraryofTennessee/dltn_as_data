<dc:title>Partial letter from Pvt. John Bell Battle to his sister</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pvt. John Bell Battle, 1st Tenn. Hvy. Art., CSA, wrote about firing at, and missing, Union gunboats from a bluff over the Mississippi River about 1.5 miles from Hickman, Ky. Gen. Cheatham galloped down the river and ordered soldiers to get the cannons; ready for a fight. There was great excitement in town as the gunboats approached. Shot were exchanged, but the gunboats stayed out of cannon range. Battle said that he had become "quite a veteran" and "done got used to the music of cannon."</dc:description>
