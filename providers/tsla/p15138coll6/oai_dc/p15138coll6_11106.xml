<dc:title>US Model 1860 Officers Cavalry Saber</dc:title>
<dc:description>The model 1860 cavalry saber was the standard for the Union cavalry. The officer version of the saber tended to be of higher quality than the enlisted model. The saber was owned by Pvt. James A. Russell, Co. B, 1st Tenn. Cav. Regt., USA. Russell was from Rutledge, Grainger Co., Tenn. He apparently privately purchased his saber or purchased this one after the war, as he never served as an officer. He returned to Grainger County after the war and lived in Poor Valley where he farmed.</dc:description>
