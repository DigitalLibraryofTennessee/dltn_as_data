<dc:title>Personal record book of Capt. P. V. H. Weems, Co. H, 11th Tenn. Inf., with his last will and testament</dc:title>
<dc:description>Small, leather-bound volume with handwritten will and codicils of Philip Van Horn Weems of Bon Aqua, Tenn. Weems recounts having been wounded at Missionary Ridge and has been mortally wounded on July 22, 1864, outside of Atlanta. He asks in writing that his family disinter his body and re-bury him in the family cemetery (which they did). He conveys as well "three of my likeliest negroes, except Angeline, Alfred, and Horace, whom I desire to be freed." Weems died 2 days after writing this.</dc:description>
