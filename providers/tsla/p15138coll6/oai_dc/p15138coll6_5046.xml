<dc:title>Letter from Pvt. J. T. Bass to Martha Bass</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pvt. J. T. Bass , Co. C, 4th (McLemore's) Cav., CSA, wrote to his wife, Martha, informing her that he was not well and suffered from the cold and a "bowel complaint." He heard that Columbia and Shelbyville, Tennessee both had cases of smallpox. He hoped that they would travel near enough for him to visit, and had heard the Yanks had been near. Bass also asked her to tell his sons to "clean up that stalk" and sew it in "hogarien" (Hungarian grass, also called foxtail millet).</dc:description>
