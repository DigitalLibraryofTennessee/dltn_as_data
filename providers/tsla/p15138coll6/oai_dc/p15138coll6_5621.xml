<dc:title>Deposition relating to Civil War spying case in Jefferson County</dc:title>
<dc:description>Deposition of Sallie Burson in Circuit Court case of Shadrach T. Harris v. William D. Fain, involving spying for the Union in Jefferson County around the time "our railroad bridges were burned by a Federal raid," referring to the 1861 bridge burnings by East Tennessee Unionists. Deposition states that "Capt. Harris had been tried at Knoxville and sentenced to death." This woman was concerned that her father "might be arrested as a Lincolnite sympathizer."</dc:description>
