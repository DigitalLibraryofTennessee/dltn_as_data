<dc:description>This is a letter written Martha Walker Allen to her husband Benjamin Allen, Co. D, 8th Tenn. Inf. Regt., USA. She reports that the family is well and expresses her want to have him home. She complains about not hearing from him often enough. She describes "pap" having bought a "darkey" for sixteen hundred dollars and that it was probably not a good idea due to the impending emancipation.</dc:description>
