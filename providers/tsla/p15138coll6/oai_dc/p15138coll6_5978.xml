<dc:title>Letter from Pvt. Charles C. Ballard to his father</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pvt. Charles C. Ballard, Co. A, 11th Miss. Inf., CSA, joined at age 16 and was serving with Co. C, Jeff Davis Legion, Miss. Cav., CSA, when he wrote this letter. Ballard received a 10-day furlough and sent his horse to a recruiting camp. "We have enough men to whip "Meed" [Gen. George Meade] at any time" because the Yankeys were all deserting. Ballard was sorry to tell his father than he had lost $200, which he was still trying to find. He was discharged on May 26, 1862 for being conscripted under age.</dc:description>
