<dc:title>Bank Note from Palace Mills, Columbus, Geo.</dc:title>
<dc:description>The Palace Mills or more properly, The Winter's Palace Mills, was started by John Gano Winter. By the 1840s-1850s the business is said to have cornered the flour market within a 100 mile radius of Columbus, Georgia. By 1859, Randolph Mott was the majority; stock holder served as president. Despite the fact that both Winter and Mott were Union men, the mill ground corn and flour for the Confederate Army and the civilian population throughout the Civil War.</dc:description>
