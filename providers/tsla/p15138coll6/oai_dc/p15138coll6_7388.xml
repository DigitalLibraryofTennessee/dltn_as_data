<dc:title>Cpl. Hank Gage</dc:title>
<dc:description>Cpl. Hank Gage, Co. G, 96th Ill. Inf. Regt., doubts that any of the nice things at the Chicago fair would reach the soldiers in the field. Though he would like hardbread, blankets, and clothing, he prefers that "little delicacies such as vegetables" go to; the sick. The crackers he received from home "melted on my tongue like ice cream so little did they taste like Army fare." Hank writes about what type of man makes a fine soldier and observes that some of the strongest had been sickly at home.</dc:description>
