<dc:title>Carte de visite of Union Capt. Marshall P. Chapin</dc:title>
<dc:description>Chapin served as a captain from South Bend, Indiana in the Union Commissary of Subsistence in Knoxville. Chapin returned with his wife after the war and went into busines as a bookseller on Gay Street in Knoxville. Photo by T. M. Schleier whose studio was on Gay Street in downtown Knoxville. The reality of the myth of the "carpetbagger" was that many Northern officers recognized business opportunity in wartime East Tennessee and returned afterwards to become stalwarts in the postbellum business community.</dc:description>
