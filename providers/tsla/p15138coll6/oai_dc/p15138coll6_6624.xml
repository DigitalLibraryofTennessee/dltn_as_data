<dc:title>Letter from Edmund Hodges to R. H. McCroskey</dc:title>
<dc:description>Edmund Hodges, imprisoned for bridge burning, wrote to ask for money, clothing and assistance in gaining his release. He reported that the imprisoned East Tennesseans were not doing well, and some had died. Some prisoners had been let go, either by bond or by parole. Hodges petitioned the authorities, but received no reply. The East Tennessee provost had sent bonds for him to Mobile, Ala., yet he was not released. Hodges asked McCroskey to advise him and to visit him in prison.</dc:description>
