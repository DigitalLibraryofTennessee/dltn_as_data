<dc:title>Engraving of original Union University in Murfreesboro</dc:title>
<dc:description>The Tennessee Baptist Convention founded Union University in Murfreesboro, Tennessee in 1848. Badly damaged by the Civil War, the school reopened in 1868, but closed again in 1873 due to financial troubles and a cholera epidemic. The trustees of West; Tennessee College in Jackson, Tenn. offered its buildings, grounds and endowment to the Tennessee Baptists, and the school moved there in 1874. It was called Southwestern Baptist University until 1907, when its was renamed Union University.</dc:description>
