<dc:title>Carte de visite of an unidentified Federal army corporal</dc:title>
<dc:description>While the soldier remains unidentified, he posed for this photograph wearing what is most likely the US enlisted infantry frock coat which would've been trimmed in sky blue piping. His coat shows corporal chevrons and on the lower portion of his sleeve are service chevrons indicating this his regiment had re-enlisted after their initial term of enlistment expired. Units which did so were termed "veteran" regiments and allowed to wear the "veteran" half chevron on the lower sleeve.</dc:description>
