<dc:title>Leather shoe</dc:title>
<dc:description>This leather shoe has cotton laces that are probably not original. The sole had wooden pegs, but all are gone except for those on the toe. It has metal pegs on the heel. The sole also has 12 hobnails. The shoe has not been worn. It has rivets in the vamp. The sole has the number 7 and the manufacture name M. E. Reeves. This is a nice example of Civil War era shoe construction. It was found in the collections of the Johnsonville State Park. It is presumed it was found on the site.</dc:description>
