<dc:description>Elizabeth Barton Taylor (1808-1879) was the wife of James Robards Taylor, a farmer in Cannon County. According to Taylor's ledger (cann059), the Federal army took some of their property during the Civil War, including food, livestock, and 19 slaves. The image is very faded and some details were redrawn with pencil. The Taylors were married in 1827 and had 7 children.</dc:description>
