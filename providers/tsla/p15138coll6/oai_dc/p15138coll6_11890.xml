<dc:title>CSA Atlanta Arsenal belt plate</dc:title>
<dc:description>This Confederate States of America belt plate was found around an old house in Macon County, Tenn. It was probably brought home by a veteran and dropped in the yard as it was the only Civil War item found in the vicinity. This style of belt plate was particularly common in the Army of Tennessee. Examples have been recovered from multiple Atlanta Campaign and Tennessee Campaign sites. Plates of this type were probably manufactured at the Atlanta Arsenal.</dc:description>
