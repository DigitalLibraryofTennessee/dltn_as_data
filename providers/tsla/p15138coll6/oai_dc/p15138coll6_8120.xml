<dc:description>Letter from Pvt. James Long, Co. E. 5th Ky. Cav., USA, to friend "Amos". He sends condolences to Amos for his father's passing, and writes of the weather in the Chattanooga area. He reports that they are "finding it more and more difficult to find food around the countryside as our supplies still have not be able to get through the rebel pickets and we are rapidly using up what we forage." He concludes by saying he is sending a package of sketches to his friend.</dc:description>
