<dc:title>Letter from G. W. Gordon to Capt. A. R. Gordon</dc:title>
<dc:description>CSA Gen. George Washington Gordon, imprisoned at Ft. Warren, Mass., writes to his cousin Andrew at Johnson's Island Prison in Ohio. He has not heard from friends in Tennessee, but expects to daily. The general sends best wishes to Andrew's roommates, and says "that I shall cherish a grateful recollection of their past kindnesses." G. W. Gordon joined the 11th Tenn. Inf. Regt., CSA, as a drillmaster. After the war, he became a member of the KKK and was elected to the Tennessee General Assembly.</dc:description>
