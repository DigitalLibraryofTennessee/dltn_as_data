<dc:title>Painting of Jefferson Davis and Joseph J. Patton (Patten) and a French coin</dc:title>
<dc:description>Painting of Jefferson Davis giving Lt. Joseph Patton, Co. E, 9th Tenn. Cav. Battn., CSA, a silver coin. With the fall of Richmond in April 1865, the Confederate treasury, along with foreign and U.S. gold and silver coins, evacuated. The coins were later distributed to Confedreate units including portions of the Army of Tennessee. Patton was a resident of Hamsphire, Tenn. and he kept his coin as a souvenir. He is buried at Mt. Pisgah Cemetery. Artist was Mildred Hartsfield. [see also Maur019]</dc:description>
