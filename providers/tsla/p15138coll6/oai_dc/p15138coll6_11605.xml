<dc:title>Percussion cap box</dc:title>
<dc:description>The cap box was worn on the front of the waist belt by Civil War soldiers. The purpose of the box was to hold the percussion caps [see lawr045] that were required to fire the vast majority of firearms in use during the Civil War. A piece of wire was carried inside the box to pick the vent of the musket when clogged. This is an early war box as the loops are sewn. There is some evidence of a maker but only the last two letters are visible. The last two letters are "LE."</dc:description>
