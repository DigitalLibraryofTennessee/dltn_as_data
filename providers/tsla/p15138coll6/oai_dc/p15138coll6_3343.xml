<dc:title>Silver goblet</dc:title>
<dc:description>Silver goblet, dated February 14, 1862. It was given to the Reverend Richard Riley Evans (1818-1903) by Germantown (Shelby County) Presbyterian Church. The Reverend Evans saved the church building from being burned during the Civil War. It is said that because he was a member of the Masons and the Union officer was also a Mason, the Union troops were persuaded to not burn the church. Richard Riley Evans's wife was Margaret Wilson Evans.</dc:description>
