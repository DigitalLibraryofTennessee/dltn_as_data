<dc:title>Postwar letter from Gen. Braxton Bragg</dc:title>
<dc:description>In a letter to an unidentified Confederate major, Gen. Braxton Bragg wrote from New Orleans of a "time of stagnation" in which a "prominent rebel is avoided as a thing contaminated." He said he would submit to "outrages and indignities" and work to mitigate severities imposed, but "no human power can induce me to aid in cinching the chains which are to bind our people." Bragg noted that he received an appointment as superintendent of the New Orleans waterworks.</dc:description>
