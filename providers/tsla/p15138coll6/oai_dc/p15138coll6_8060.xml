<dc:title>Letter from Confederate soldier John Lafayette Lemonds</dc:title>
<dc:description>Writing to his future wife M. [Ellen] McCorkle from Lumpkin Hospital in Rome, Ga. after having sustained a wound to his arm, 1st Lt. John L. Lemonds of Co. C, 5th Inf. CSA pours out his affection for the woman he has cherished, as he says, all his life.""The surgeon," he writes, "says I will never be able for service anymore." This letter is a wonderful illustration of the intensity with which young Southerners in love--soldiers in the field and women back home--lived through the experience of war.</dc:description>
