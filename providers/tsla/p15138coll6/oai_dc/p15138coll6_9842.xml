<dc:title>Letter from James W. Dyer to his wife, Narcissa Woodard Dyer</dc:title>
<dc:description>James W. Dyer (1836-1880) sent this letter to his wife, Narcissa, in Lincoln County from the Major Sherman Military Prison in Nashville. He had been sent to the prison from Pulaski, though no charges had been brought against him. He had heard reports of bushwackers, and trusted that he would be released soon. Dyers wanted his wife not to worry, and asked her not to send anything except $10-15. The letter bears the state prison stamp.</dc:description>
