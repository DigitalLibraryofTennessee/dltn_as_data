<dc:title>Letter from N. R. Wilkins to his cousin E. R. Porter</dc:title>
<dc:description>Wilkins wrote his cousin in Hardin County, Tenn. to inform him that his son, Pvt. Alexander "Texas" Porter, Co. G, 11th Miss. Inf., CSA, died on August 30, 1862 after being shot at the Battle of Second Manassas. His last words were "boys be still and listen to the word of command." Porter's captain would write the family to say he never "saw a better soldier." Wilkins himself had been sick and his regiment was blowing up bridges of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.</dc:description>
