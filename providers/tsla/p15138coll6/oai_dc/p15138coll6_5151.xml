<dc:title>Tintype of Robert Milton Byrn</dc:title>
<dc:description>Framed tintype of Robert Milton Byrn, who was a school teacher near McEwen, Humphreys County. Mistaking Byrn for a spy or scout, Federal soldiers captured him at Cuba Landing and detained him on an ironclad gunboat. He was sent to the Union prison at Camp Douglas, Chicago, where he died of measles. The camp was known as the "Andersonville of the North." The rectangular picture frame, of folk-art style, has a 5-pointed star in each corner.</dc:description>
