<dc:description>Double-barrel shotgun, marked "Fall and Cunningham," which was a hardware store in Nashville. On the other side of the lockplate it is marked Nashville, TN. Oftentimes, these guns were made in Europe but stamped locally. This was a civilian weapon but such an item was used by C. S. A. cavalry during the war.</dc:description>
