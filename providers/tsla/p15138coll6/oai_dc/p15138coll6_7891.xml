<dc:title>Albumen print of James Robards Taylor</dc:title>
<dc:description>James Robards Taylor (1804-1879) was a Cannon County farmer during the Civil War. He did not serve in the war. His ledger book (cann059) documents items that the Federal army took from him, including 19 slaves and some livestock. The image is very faded and some details were redrawn with pencil. The Taylors were married in 1827 and had 7 children.</dc:description>
