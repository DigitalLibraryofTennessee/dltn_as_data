<dc:title>Letter from Captain Archibald D. Norris, Co. K, 7th Tenn. Inf. Regt., CSA to his father</dc:title>
<dc:description>Capt. Norris speaks of the aftermath of the Battle of Fredericksburg and wounds and casualties at the Battle of Seven Pines. "The result of both battles was a victory on our side much more decisive however in the last fight than in that of Seven Pines." Says: "They are calling for 300,000 more troops but cannot I think raise them except by draft and soldiers of that kind are not worth much." Says Northern newspapers "acknowledge the folly of trying&#65533;to subjugate the South."</dc:description>
