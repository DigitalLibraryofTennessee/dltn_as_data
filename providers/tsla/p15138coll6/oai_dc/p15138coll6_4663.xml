<dc:title>Letter from Alfred Abernathy to his wife, Bettie</dc:title>
<dc:description>After his brother Cpl. John Abernathy, Co. K, 1st Tenn. Inf. Regt., CSA, was injured at the Battle of Cheat Mt., W. Va., Alfred traveled to find him and bring him home. Writing from Gen. Daniel Smith Donelson's headquarters, he asked Bettie to tell his father that John bore himself in battle "like a man and a soldier." He described the effort to locate the wounded soldiers, gave names of those feared dead, and mentioned seeing several soldiers, including Capt. Ike Brunson and Gen. J. D. C. Atkins.</dc:description>
