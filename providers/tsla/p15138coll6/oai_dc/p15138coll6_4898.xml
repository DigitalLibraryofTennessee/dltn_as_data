<dc:title>Plank from wooden shipping crate</dc:title>
<dc:description>Piece of a wooden shipping crate stamped with " + N W R R Nash Tenn Smeedsville Tenn." A small portion of the left side, presumably marked with "N" was cut off at some point. The Nashville &amp; Northwestern Railroad was chartered by the Tennessee State Legislature in 1852, but was taken over by the Union army during the Civil War. In 1873, the town of Smeedsville was renamed Dickson.</dc:description>
