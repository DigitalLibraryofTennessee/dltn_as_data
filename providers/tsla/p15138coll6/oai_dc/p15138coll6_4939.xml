<dc:title>Civil war memoir, detailing in part a raid on the Nashville and Northwestern Railroad</dc:title>
<dc:description>Remembrance of Woodworth family's tour of the battlefield at White Bluff, Tenn. They saw scorched earth, graves, and remains of "Irish houses." J. Howell recalled the guerilla McNeary's [Duval McNairy] raid on N. &amp; N.W RR. Local women took baskets of food to federal troops, but when they discovered the soldiers were negroes, they would not feed them. Howell saw the dead stacked in wagons and buried in ditches near Cumberland River. He said after the first freshet, bodies washed up on banks.</dc:description>
