<dc:title>1831 Springfield converted flintlock musket</dc:title>
<dc:description>This musket belonged to a family in Jellico, Tennessee, near the Kentucky border. According to family tradition, it was used in the Civil War. The musket was originally a flintlock but was converted to percussion before the Civil War. Conversion muskets of this type were commonly used by both sides early in the war and by the Confederates until very late. The conversion type is commonly referred to as a "cone-in-barrel" conversion.</dc:description>
