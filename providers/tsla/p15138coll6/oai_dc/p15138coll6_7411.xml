<dc:title>Letter from Patience Estill to Joseph Lusk</dc:title>
<dc:description>Patience is thankful to learn that her uncle is in the land of the living; she had given up hope of hearing from him. The "boys has both joined the army for twelve months" and will have to go into camp soon. Patience reports word "that the rebls [sic] was; a coming," and she hopes that the war will soon be over. "I never was as tired of anything in my life." Lusk deserted Co. I, 43rd Tenn. Inf. and joined Co. A, 7th East Tenn. Inf., USA. He was later appointed 1st Lt., Co. L, 1st Tenn. Cav. Regt., USA.</dc:description>
