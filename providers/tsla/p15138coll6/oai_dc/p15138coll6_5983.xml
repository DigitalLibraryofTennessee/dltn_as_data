<dc:title>Letter from Richard Baxter Porter to his family</dc:title>
<dc:description>Baxter Porter wrote of seeing Yankee pickets while scouting near Cleveland, Tenn. He had not received rations in a week and had to spend money from his wages to buy food daily from locals who charged high prices. "Georgians are a very mean race of people [who] think a soldier worse than a dog." Yankees could take Georgia and burn all "the scoundrels have" if it would not hurt the Confederacy. Porter listed new men who joined the company from Hardin County.</dc:description>
