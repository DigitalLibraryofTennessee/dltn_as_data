<dc:title>Letter from J. L. Swann to "Gordon's Followers"</dc:title>
<dc:description>Letter from J. L. Swann to "Gordon's Followers." The letter was found in the Manning/McClanahan family smokehouse. The location is referred to as "Rural Retreat." He writes very clearly about his reasons for fighting for the South, noting that he never expects to own a negro but is fighting for the South &amp; Southern rights. "Gordon's Followers" appears to be the followers of the abolitionist preacher Dr. Gordon, although his identity is not certain. Swann refers to Gordon's Followers as rebels.</dc:description>
