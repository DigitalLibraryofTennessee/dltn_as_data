<dc:title>Letter from a soldier in Hume's escort to Colonel Joseph Cathey</dc:title>
<dc:description>Letter written by a soldier (name illegibile) to "Colonel" Joseph Cathey dated March 5, 1865 decrying the demise of the Confederacy. The soldier was a member of Hume's Escort of Wheeler's Cavalry Corps. Cathey was from Fork's of Pigeon River, NC. The current site is Bethel, NC. The title "colonel" was an honorary one as Cathey operated a store and had served in the North Carolina State Senate in the 1840s. The letter discusses that Gen. Lee should evacuate Richmond and "fall on Sherman" in NC.</dc:description>
