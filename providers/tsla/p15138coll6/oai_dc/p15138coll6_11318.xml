<dc:title>Letter written By William H. Bendy, Co. M, 9th N.J. Inf. Regt., USA</dc:title>
<dc:description>Bendy composed this letter while just off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. At the writing of the letter his regiment was still aboard the ship Ann E. Thompson and the steamboat George Peabody. The regiment had been on water for 32 days. He complains that the last envelope he received arrived without the letter as it had not been sealed and relates the health of himself and a few comrades. On February 7, 1862 his regiment would take part in the assault on Roanoke Island, losing 9 killed and 25 wounded.</dc:description>
