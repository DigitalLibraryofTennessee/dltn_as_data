<dc:title>Letter from William M. Thurman to his wife Margaret</dc:title>
<dc:description>Thurman speaks of domestic matters and expresses his homesickness at being so far from his family. Boredom seems to reign in camp at Port Hudson. He instructs her to cash some Confederate money in case the Yankees return to Middle Tennessee and gives instructions to his wife regarding the sale of livestock and collection of debts. This letter is an excellent example of the challenges of farm management assumed by women in the absence of soldier husbands during the war.</dc:description>
