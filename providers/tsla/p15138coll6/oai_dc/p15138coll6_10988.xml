<dc:title>Letter from Elijah Hall</dc:title>
<dc:description>In copy letter, Elijah Hall of Morgan County is writing from Bridgeport, Ala. to his family and friends. He writes of friends returning home and that he does "not think it would be safe for me to stay there I think they will prosecute me in several cases if I came there to stay." He may have been wanted by the authorities for guerilla activities during the war.</dc:description>
