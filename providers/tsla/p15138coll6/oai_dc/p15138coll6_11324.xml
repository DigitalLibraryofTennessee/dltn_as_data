<dc:title>Letter written on US Sanitary Commission stationary by William Bendy, Co. M, 9th N.J. Inf. Regt., USA to his parents and sisters</dc:title>
<dc:description>Bendy writes, "we have been in this vacinity (sic) about two weeks and have been on the move the most of the time but now things has got quiet again and we are taking our rest." He further describes the peace proposals advanced by the South. In his post-scriptum he mentions joining a society as he did not want to be a drunkard.  This could reference the Sanitary Commission or another temperance organization. The US Sanitary Commission provided relief for Federal soldiers throughout the war.</dc:description>
