<dc:title>Letter from Sgt. Thomas G. Taylor</dc:title>
<dc:description>Addressed to "Ann," Taylor of Co. B, 10th DeMoss' Cav. Regt., part of Gen. N. B. Forrest's command, writes of skirmishing with "Yanks" outside Tullahoma saying that "they can never whip us." He also writes: "tell all the negroes howdy that don't intend to run away &amp; those that does leave they had better never cross my path for death will be their portion if they do." Taylor apparently wrote this just before a fight in which he was mortally wounded.</dc:description>
