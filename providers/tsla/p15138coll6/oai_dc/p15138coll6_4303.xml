<dc:title>Letter of J. E. Scott to wife</dc:title>
<dc:description>Scott writes after a rainy night, "I am in great surpence [sic] to hear from you I slept standing under a Tree." Scott mentions the "great victory" at the Battle of Murfreesboro (Stones River). He implores his wife to not let the children forget him, and entrusts them to God's care. Scott served in Cheatham's Division, Maney's Brigade (Confederate), and died in an Atlanta hospital during the war. He was a farmer in civilian life.</dc:description>
