<dc:title>Letter from Bishop Stephen Elliott to Bishop Leonidas Polk</dc:title>
<dc:description>Bishop Elliott sent Polk a detailed account of the Montgomery Convention of Episcopalian churchmen. He mentioned Polk's military appointment, noting that several of the clergy were against it. Elliot offered his services to the Louisiana Diocese in the coming winter and spring. He also wrote of Georgia's participation in the Civil War, and said that the state would send 40,000 soldiers into the field if it could procure arms.</dc:description>
