<dc:title>Two wooden rings made by a Confederate prisoner</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pvt. George Carroll Garrett, Co. E, 45th Tenn. Inf. Regt., CSA, was captured and sent to Rock Island (Ill.) prison in the Mississippi River. While a POW, he is said to have carved and painted these black enamel rings, one with a gold heart design. He enlisted in Murfreesboro in October 1862 and spent much of his enlistment in hospitals and at one point contracted measles. He was captured at McMinnville (Tenn.) in April 1863. He remained a prisoner until taking the Oath of Allegiance in April 1865.</dc:description>
