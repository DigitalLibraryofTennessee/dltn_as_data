<dc:title>Civil War letter from William Thurman to his wife and children</dc:title>
<dc:description>Writing to his wife Margaret from the Confederate fortifications on the Mississippi River at Port Hudson, Louisiana, Thurman discusses health and domestic news. Among the things he mentions are the rings she has sent to him to "git made." Very little military news Port Hudson and Vicksburg were the last fortified spots on the Mississippi River controlled by the Confederacy in early 1863. Thurman's regiment could not be determined.</dc:description>
