<dc:title>Saddlebags that belonged to Judge Austin Miller</dc:title>
<dc:description>Polished leather saddlebags that belonged to Judge Austin Miller. An inscription on the items reads: "Judge A. Miller, Bolivar, Tenn." The saddlebags were found in Magnolia Manor, a Georgian Colonial style home in Bolivar built by Miller in 1847. Miller drew the plans for the house himself. Each brick of the house was handmade on site by slaves. During the Civil War, Magnolia Manor was used as headquarters for four Union generals (including Grant and Sherman).</dc:description>
