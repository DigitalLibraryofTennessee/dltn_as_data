<dc:title>Letter from Capt. Archibald D. Norris, Co. K, 7th Tenn. Inf. Regt., CSA to his father</dc:title>
<dc:description>Capt. Norris writes his father and mentions a 13 mile march andillness within the company. He requests water-proof boots for the winter as well as brown jean trousers, lined throughout, a military style overcoat of brown jeans with pockets, woolen; overshirts, undershirts, drawers, socks, and gloves. He tells his father that the unit has yet to smell powder and probably would not for some time. He speculates that they will not winter on the mountain due to poor roads.</dc:description>
