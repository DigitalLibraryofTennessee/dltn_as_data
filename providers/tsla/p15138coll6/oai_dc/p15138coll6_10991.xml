<dc:title>Letter from Elijah Hall to his family</dc:title>
<dc:description>Copy letter from Elijah Hall to his family. He complains of being in "very poor health" and being lonesome and concerned that there is nothing for the future that will "cheer my drooping heart." He also writes of planning to go to California in the spring. During the past year, he moved from north Alabama to Missouri, and seems depressed about being unable to come home. The only Elijah Hall in a Tennessee unit is a private, D Co., 16th Cav., a West Tennessee regiment.</dc:description>
