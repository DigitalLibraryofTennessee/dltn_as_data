<dc:title>Group of three powder and one shot flask</dc:title>
<dc:description>The three brass flasks were designed to hold gun powder. The metal spouts held a measured charge of powder. The first two are most likely for pistols while the thrid one was for a rifle or musket. All three of the brass flasks have martial scenes and the third one was often issued in the 1840s and 1850s to militia armed with the Model 1841 Rifle. The fourth flask is made of molded leather and was used for holding shot. It is civilian in design and was used in bird hunting with a shotgun.</dc:description>
