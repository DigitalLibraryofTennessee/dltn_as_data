<dc:title>Letter to Daniel Hoge Bruce from a friend</dc:title>
<dc:description>Letter to Daniel Hoge Bruce, Co. A, 51st Va. Inf., Regt., CSA, from his friend, M. C. T. She writes, "Burbridge and his staff halted and took dinner with us, he halted three Brigades to guard his pretty self and remained here two hours, he had the house guarded so that it was not plundered by the lawless gang. You have no idea how miserable I felt when I saw the long-heeled, thick-lipped, popeyed, bandy shanked, knock kneed negroes marching along well armed, _ for what?"</dc:description>
