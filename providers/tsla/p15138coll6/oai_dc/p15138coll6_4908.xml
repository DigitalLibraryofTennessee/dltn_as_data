<dc:title>Letter from James N. Watkins to his sister</dc:title>
<dc:description>Watkins writes to his sister that they have left Corinth and moved to Lagrange. The regiment has found a nice chestnut grove to camp, but there are four men to a tent. His health is poor, so he visited the 3rd Michigan Hospital. Still no pay, and he is he is out of money. Three negro regiments are here, as well as some from Iowa, Tennessee, Indiana, and Michigan. Rumor is they will go to Texas this winter. Watkins served in Co. G, 2nd Iowa Inf. Regt., USA.</dc:description>
