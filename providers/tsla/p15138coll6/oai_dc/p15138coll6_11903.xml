<dc:title>Souvenir postcard</dc:title>
<dc:description>This post-war souvenir postcard features a well-known image of Major General Joseph Hooker and staff in 1863 in their winter quarters in Lookout Valley. Hooker commanded the Army of the Potomac until his defeat at Chancerllorsville in April 1863. With the Army of the Cumberland besieged at Chattanooga in the fall of 1863, the 11th and 12th Corps, under Hooker's command, were sent to relieve the siege. In 1864, the two corps were consolidated to form the 20th Corps with Hooker in command.</dc:description>
