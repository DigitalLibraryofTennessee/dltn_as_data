<dc:title>Letter from James B. Owen to his father</dc:title>
<dc:description>Four-page letter from Pvt. James B. Owen, Co. D, 31st Ill. Inf. Regt., USA to his father. He says they have had hard fighting, have weakened the Confederates' battery. He says he does not think there will be any more fighting as "we have; whipped them in four battles one day after another." They made a charge on the 20th of that month under the command of General Grant, who allowed Pemberton to surrender. Owen was from Brownsville, Ill. and died Sept. 3, 1863.</dc:description>
