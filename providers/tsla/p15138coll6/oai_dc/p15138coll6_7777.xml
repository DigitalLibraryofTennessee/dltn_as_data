<dc:description>Letter from Captain A.D. Norris, Co. K, 7th Tenn. Inf. Regt., CSA to his family. He writes of Gen. Hooker, commander of the Yankee army, who seems to be waiting for the weather to moderate before advancing on Fredericksburg. He continues to say that "The; impression exists that Lincoln has assembled his forces for one last grand desperate effort to crush the South and if he fails that this will be his last attempt." He also writes of the day of "fasting humiliation and prayer" as appointed by Pres. Davis.</dc:description>
