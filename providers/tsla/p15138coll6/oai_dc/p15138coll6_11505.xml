<dc:title>Cabinet Card of Capt. Cyrus DeLany, Co. B, 30th Ohio Inf. Regt., USA</dc:title>
<dc:description>This post-war image was taken in California and shows veteran Capt. Cyrus DeLany, Co. B, 30th Ohio Inf. Regt., USA at his sister's home. DeLany returned to the army in 1867 serving first in the 35th US Inf. Regt. and later in the 15th US Inf. Regt. He eventually rose to captain in the 15th and seems to have remained in the regular army until his death in 1888.</dc:description>
