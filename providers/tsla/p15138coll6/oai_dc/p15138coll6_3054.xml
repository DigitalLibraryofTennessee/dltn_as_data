<dc:title>Spencer carbine</dc:title>
<dc:description>Spencer carbine repeating firearm. It holds seven .52 caliber cartridges in a tubular magazine that is housed in the buttstock. It was a popular firearm for cavalrymen because they could fire several times without having to reload after each shot. There also was a Spencer rifle. It had a longer barrel, and there was a wood forestock that extended from the breech mechanism to a few inches short of the barrel muzzle. Mechanically, the guns were identical. To load, the shooter pushed down the hinged trigger guard, which opened the breech, ejected the fired cartridge, then pulled a new cartridge from the magazine. When the levered trigger guard was closed, the new cartridge was fed into the barrel and the gun was ready to fire.</dc:description>
