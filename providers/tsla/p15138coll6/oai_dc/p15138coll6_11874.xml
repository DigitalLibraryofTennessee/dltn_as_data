<dc:title>Letter from Brother John to Benjamin</dc:title>
<dc:description>Dated from Fort Mitchel [later Fort Mitchell, Ky.], this letter was written by a soldier signing himself "Your Brother John." He informs Benjamin that he is "enjoying myself Hugely, much better than I expected. I have seen the Elephant and Cincinatti." He goes on to describe the Ohio River and Fort Mitchel. The men have "other Forts and flying Artilery in abundance" as well as "Hundreds of Caverly." A soldier was said to have seen the elephant when he experienced battle.
