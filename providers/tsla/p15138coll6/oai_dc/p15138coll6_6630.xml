<dc:title>Letter from Mrs. Edmund Hodges and Mrs. William Hodges to their husbands</dc:title>
<dc:description>The women wrote of their efforts to secure their husbands' release and said that it was well known that "the causes that led to your arrest were founded on the false rumor that you were as true to the Southern interest as any man." A petition had been sent to Richmond for his release, but she had heard nothing about it. She assured him that they were doing everything they could to gain his release. The men had been imprisoned for the bridge burning at Strawberry Plains, Tenn.</dc:description>
