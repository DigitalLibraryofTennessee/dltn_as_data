<dc:title>Carte de visite of Lindsley Hall and University of Nashville campus</dc:title>
<dc:description>From Fletcher Kennard's scrapbook, an Ohio Union soldier, the inscription read: "Hospital during civil war." Kennard apparently was hospitalized there during the war. There appears to have been some confusion between this building and the Literary Depart- ment building on the same campus (see Monr036). As a Federal hospital during the war, Lindsley Hall contained 200 beds and was reserved for officers. The University steam plant and another campus building are visible on the left.</dc:description>
