<dc:title>Chickamauga "Peace Pipe"</dc:title>
<dc:description>These corn cob "peace pipes" were given to all attendees at the Chickamauga Barbeque held in 1889 in Crawfish Springs, Georgia, prior to establishment of the first Civil War national battlefield. The barbeque was attended by former Confederate and Federal soldiers and was an official reunion of the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) and the United Confederate Veterans (UCV). This example was found in Milledgeville, Georgia and was probably carried home as a souvenir by a Confederate veteran.</dc:description>
