<dc:title>Monroe County court case of Oliver Bayless re: emigration to Liberia &amp; voluntary enslavement</dc:title>
<dc:description>Court case involving Oliver Bayless, manumitted with wife Nancy &amp; other slaves by their former owner Sarah Bayless, who was secretly a member of the American Colonization Society and who desired her ex-slaves to emigrate to Liberia. Sarah Bayless' 1853 will freed upon her death dozens of slaves, though she apparently did not provide them with the funds to leave the state. Deponents are questioning whether freed slaves could survive in Liberia and Oliver is petitioning the court to be re-enslaved.</dc:description>
