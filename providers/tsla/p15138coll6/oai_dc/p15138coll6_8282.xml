<dc:title>Carte de visite of Joseph Jefferson Dention and his brothers</dc:title>
<dc:description>Joseph Jefferson Denton was a member of the homeguard in Cocke County, Tenn. He was born March 8, 1810 died Sept. 9, 1887. He was a strong Union man during the war and joined the Union League in Cocke County, Tenn. in 1868 (newp017). He was too old for active military service so he joined the pro-Unionist home guard. The home guard was composed of men and boys too old or too young for military service. They provided some degree of security and were called out in times of military threat.</dc:description>
