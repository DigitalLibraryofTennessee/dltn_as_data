<dc:title>French coin of Capt. Archibald A. Lipscomb, Co. G, 9th Tenn. Cav.  Battn., CSA</dc:title>
<dc:description>The Confederate government did not generate any specie and resultingly foreign coins as well as US coins were part of their treasury. With the fall of Richmond in April 1865, the Confederate Treasury fled with casks of gold and silver specie. Eventually, these coins were distributed to commands that were either escorting government officials or to the Army of Tennessee. Capt. Lipscomb retained this French coin as a memento of the surrender Joseph E. Johnston's army, on April 26, 1865 in North Carolina.</dc:description>
