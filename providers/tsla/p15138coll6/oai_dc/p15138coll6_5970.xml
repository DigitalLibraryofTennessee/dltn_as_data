<dc:title>Letter from Pvt. James Ballard to his parents</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pvt. James E. Ballard, Co. A, 11th Miss. Inf., CSA, wrote that he was in good health. His company, however, lacked officers because Col. Liddell and Maj. Ivens were killed, Col. Butler and Lt. Graham were wounded, and Lt. Taylor had his arm shot off. He described the difficulties on the march to Richmond after the Battle of Manassas and encouraged his brother Charlie to remain at home. Ballard died at the Battle of Gettysburg on July 3, 1863.</dc:description>
