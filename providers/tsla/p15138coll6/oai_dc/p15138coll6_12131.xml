<dc:title>1862 Letter - Camps near Nolensville, Tennessee</dc:title>
<dc:description>This material revolves around the potential discharge of Richard T. Long, a private in Company "D" of the 3rd regiment of Tennessee Cavalry. The request appears to have been written by W. M. Robson, the 1st LF of Company "D," to "General," and explains the necessity of Long to return to his wool carding factory on the Duck River, Maury County, TN. The request was dated November 15, 1862 when company "D" were at camp near Nolensville, Tennessee. Long enlisted on November 16, 1861 at Camp Cheatham.</dc:description>
