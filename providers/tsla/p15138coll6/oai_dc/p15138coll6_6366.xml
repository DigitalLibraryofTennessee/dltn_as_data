<dc:title>Photograph of Confederate veteran William R. Campbell</dc:title>
<dc:description>William Campbell served as a private in Co. D, 8th Ark. Inf., CSA. Seen here in a United Confederate Veterans uniform, he held a tattered Confederate battle flag and posed with a young lady wearing a sash with the words "MAID OF HONOR." Campbell fought at Shiloh and Murfreesboro, and was wounded at both Chickamauga and Atlanta. He wore a wooden peg leg because his foot was shot off at the Battle of Franklin. He was a prisoner in Nashville, then Camp Chase, Ohio, and later paroled at Vicksburg, Miss.</dc:description>
