<dc:title>Oil painting "The Battle of Lookout Mountain" (1863-4) by James Walker</dc:title>
<dc:description>Walker, an English-born painter, was commissioned by Union Gen. Joseph Hooker to paint the more famous canvas of Lookout Mountain with the general on a white horse. This painting shows the face of the mountain sprinkled with Confederate 1st national flags as Hooker's command--a greater part of 11th Corps and other units--marshall at the base in preparation for attack. Moccasin Bend is shown at left middle ground. It is thought that Walker may have been present during the battle.</dc:description>
