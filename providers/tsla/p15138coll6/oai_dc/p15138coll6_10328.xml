<dc:title>Bowie knife used by Sgt. George Boy Smith, 61st Tenn. Inf. Regt., CSA</dc:title>
<dc:description>Sgt. George Boy Smith was from Bristol, Tenn. and joined the 61st Tenn. Inf. Regt., CSA in Blountville in 1862. Smith, along with his regiment, was captured at Vicksburg in July 1863. After being exchanged in late 1863, the regiment received horses and redesignated "mounted infantry." They were sent to East Tenn. Smith survived the war and was buried in East Hill Cemetery in Bristol, Tenn. The Bowie knife was popular early in the war, but rarely carried due to the size and weight.</dc:description>
