<dc:title>Copy print of General Alfred E. Jackson</dc:title>
<dc:description>Alfred Eugene Jackson was born in Davidson County, Tennessee and attended Washington and Greeneville College in Greene County, Tenn. He took up farming in East Tenn. as well as dealing in produce and manufactured goods. He joined the Confederate cause and rose to the rank of brigadier general and served in the Department of East Tenn. The war left Jackson impoverished and he went back to farming. He was pardoned by Pres. Johnson and his estate was returned to him. He died in Jonesboro, Tenn. in 1889.</dc:description>
