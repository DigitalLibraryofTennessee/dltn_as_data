<dc:title>Letter of Thomas M. Crutcher written from Rock Island Prison, Ill.</dc:title>
<dc:description>Written from Barracks No. 1 at Rock Island military prison to "Misses Flora and Immogene," enclosed with which were rings to the young ladies. He says "they are not perfect but the best I can do at this time." He longs for the "dawn of peace" when he will sit around the fireside in civilian life and return the many "favors" the young ladies have shown him. Donor says that Crutcher may have died at Rock Island Prison.</dc:description>
