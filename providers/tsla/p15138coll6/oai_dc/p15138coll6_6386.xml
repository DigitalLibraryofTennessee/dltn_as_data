<dc:title>Leather pommel holsters</dc:title>
<dc:description>Possibly for .44 caliber Colt revolvers, these holsters were found along Route 22 near Huntingdon, Tenn. The center strap which connected the two holsters is missing. Pommel holsters went across the front of the saddle. Also missing is a small leather pouch which was attached to each holster to hold extra rounds. The leather or painted canvas covers for the holsters are also missing.</dc:description>
