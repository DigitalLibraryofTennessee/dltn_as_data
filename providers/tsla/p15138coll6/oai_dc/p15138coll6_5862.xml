<dc:title>Letter from Col. John M. Huger to Bishop Leonidas Polk</dc:title>
<dc:description>Col. Huger wrote to learn Polk's opinion of Bragg's retreat from Murfreesboro, grieved at the "unqualified disapproval of his chief's conduct." Huger was "heartsick from disappointment" for he hoped Bragg would be "the Man of the Occasion." Admitting that he had wronged a "noble warrior," he asked Polk's help finding the truth and wiping an impression from the public mind that was injurious to Bragg and the "noble cause which has made us willing victims on the altar of patriotism."</dc:description>
