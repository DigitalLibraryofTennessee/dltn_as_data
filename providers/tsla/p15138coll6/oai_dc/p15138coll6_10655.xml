William Freeling and said that the men did not respect him. He wrote that they had "three or four little fights" and when attacked by two gunboats at Hickman, Ky. "we whiped them and sent them back." He documented fighting near Columbus, Ky. and noted that they were well fortified with between '30 and 35 thousand" troops.</dc:description>
