<dc:title>Southern claim for the loss of cotton from a gin in Lawrence County, Tennessee.</dc:title>
<dc:description>The applicant claims that cotton was removed from the gin "by order of Genl. McArthur an officer of the Federal Army commanded by Maj. Genl. Grant." General John McArthur was born in Scotland and emigrated to Chicago as a young man. He was appointed colonel of the 12th Ill. Inf. Regt., USA in 1861 but eventually rose to division command under Grant and later Sherman. He was known to wear a Scottish tam o'shanter from time to time.</dc:description>
