<dc:title>Letter from Union soldier Alonzo Swift to his wife</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pvt. Alonzo Swift was a teamster with the 137th N. Y. Inf. Regt., USA. He mentions going to US Sanitary Commission Sunday services and speaks of losing a great many horses and mules through the course of the recent Atlanta campaign--a brigade has been sent to Nashville to replenish these animals. Swift talks of "sending my vote home" in the upcoming 1864 presidential election: he says that Lincoln will get most of the soldiers' votes McClellan may get "a few but I think that he will fail."</dc:description>
