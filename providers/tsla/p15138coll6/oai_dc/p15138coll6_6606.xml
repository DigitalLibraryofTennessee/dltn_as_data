<dc:title>Mississippi resolution on the formation of white militia unit (the Church Hill Troop) to disarm and protect against black freedmen</dc:title>
<dc:description>Because of the "demoralized condition of the negro population and the disorganized state of society," people resolved to create a home guard to protect the law-abiding [white] citizens and their interests. The resolution included rules and regulations, including command structure, the apprehension of "night-walkers or riders, whether white or black," and depriving "negroes found with arms" of their weapons. The troop would not mete out punishment, but would turn offenders over to a magistrate.</dc:description>
