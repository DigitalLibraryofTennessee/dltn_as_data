<dc:title>Letter from Pvt. Alexander Texas Porter to his father</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pvt. Alexander Porter, Co. G, 11th Miss. Inf., CSA, wrote about six days of intense battle near Richmond in which they "whooped and drove the enemy back 15 or 20 miles to there gun boats" and "slaid them by the hundreds and thousands." His company lost 54 killed and wounded, and he listed several names. He hoped this battle would be an end to the war, for he was tired, hungry and dirty. Porter had heard of battles near home and of negros running away. He died at Second Manassas on August 30, 1862.</dc:description>
