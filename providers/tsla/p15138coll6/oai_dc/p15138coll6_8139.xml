<dc:title>Carte de visite of Dee Smith, 45th Tenn. Inf. Regt., CSA</dc:title>
<dc:description>Dee Smith was a member of the 45th Tenn. Inf. Regt., CSA. His cousin DeWitt Smith Jobe was a member of Coleman's Scouts and was tortured and killed by Federal troops. When Dee Smith heard the news, he deserted, returned to Middle Tennessee, and killed 50 Federal soldiers. Federal troops captured Smith near Nolensville in 1865. Badly wounded when captured, he died while awaiting execution in the Rutherford County Courthouse in Murfreesboro. Both men were cousins of Gen. Thomas Benton Smith, CSA.</dc:description>
