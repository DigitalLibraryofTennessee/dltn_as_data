<dc:title>Postwar West Virginia medal for John Harrison, Co. K, 13th W. Va. Inf. Regt., USA</dc:title>
<dc:description>Brass medal and ribbon issued by the State of West Virginia (authorized by the legislature in 1866) to John Harrison, Co. K, 13th Regt. W. Va Inf. Regt., USA. Inscribed "Honorably Discharged" and "Presented by the State of West Virginia," these were presented after the war by the West Virginia General Assembly to its Union soldiers or their heirs. They had to be claimed in person. The predominantly Unionist mountain counties of western Virginia had seceded from that Confederate state in 1863.</dc:description>
