<dc:title>Lithograph of the steam locomotive "General"</dc:title>
<dc:description>The "General" was a locomotive working on the Western &amp; Atlantic Railroad between Chattanooga and Atlanta. In April 1862, a group of Union raiders under Capt. Andrews captured the locomotive in an attempt to destroy the railroad. The raiders were pursued by Confederates on the "Texas." Andrews and his men were captured and executed for spying. The General is on exhibit in Big Shanty (now Kennesaw), Georgia. The Texas is on exhibit at the Atlanta Cyclorama.</dc:description>
