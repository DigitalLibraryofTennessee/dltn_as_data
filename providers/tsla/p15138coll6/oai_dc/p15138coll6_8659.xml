<dc:title>"Feathered Star" quilt</dc:title>
<dc:description>"Feathered Star" quilt made with approximately 1850s fabrics. The quilt belonged to Martha L. Storment (born about 1822 in South Carolina), wife of William Storment (February 10, 1811-September 15, 1885). According to family lore, the quilt was stored in the; floor of a smokehouse to protect it from the invading army when Federal troops came through Tishomingo County, Mississippi, in 1862. Some of the earliest examples of the "Feathered Star" quilt pattern date back to the 1830s.</dc:description>
