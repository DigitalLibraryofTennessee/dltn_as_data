<dc:title>Letter from Alonzo Swift to his wife</dc:title>
<dc:description>Alonzo Swift served as a teamster in the 137th N.Y. Inf. Regt., USA. The 137th N.Y. served in the East before being transferred to help lift the siege of Chattanooga in 1863. Swift discusses that his 12th Corps is being consolidated with the 11th Corps. under the command of Gen. Joseph Hooker. He incorrectly writes it will be called the 1st Corps. In reality, it was renamed the 20th Corps. He is upset that Gen. Slocum was transferred to Vicksburg. He misses his family and his homesick.</dc:description>
