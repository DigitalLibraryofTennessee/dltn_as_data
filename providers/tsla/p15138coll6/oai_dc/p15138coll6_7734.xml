<dc:description>Capt. Archibald D. Norris Co. K, 7th Tenn. Inf. Regt., CSA writes this letter as his regiment is arriving in Lynchburg, Virginia. Norris mentions the Confederate victory at Manassas on July 21, 1861. He mentions that the people of Lynchburg are hospitable; and that he "called on Browlow while in Knoxville. He seems to be a very fine old Gentleman." The 7th Tenn. served the entire war with the Army of Northern Virginia and Norris saved its flag from capture at Gettysburg on July 3, 1863.</dc:description>
