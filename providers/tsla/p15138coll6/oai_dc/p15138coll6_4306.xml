<dc:title>Letter of J. E. Scott to wife</dc:title>
<dc:description>To "My Dear Wife and little ones," Scott writes of camp as the "greatest excuse of wickedness which we frigtined [sic] away into that retired, unfrequented corner, nestled down at the feet of Jesus." He has confidence that God will guide her in raising their children, and exhorts her to "speak of me often to them.  Scott served in Cheatham's Division, Maney's Brigade (Confederate), and died in an Atlanta hospital during the war. He was a farmer in civilian life.</dc:description>
