<dc:description>Born November 23, 1839, and died March 2, 1902, James Castor Fuqua lived his entire life in Macon County, Tennessee. He was in the 24th Tennessee Infantry Regiment and fought at the Battle of Perryville, Kentucky. He was wounded twice at the Battle of Murfreesboro, Tennessee, with a minie ball to the shoulder and hip. He was injured badly enough that he walked with a limp for the rest of his life. During the war, he was captured and freed later as part of a prisoner exchange.</dc:description>
