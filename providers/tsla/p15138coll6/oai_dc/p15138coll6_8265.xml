<dc:title>Crayon print of Confederate veteran Earl Roper and his wife</dc:title>
<dc:description>Earl (1840-1919) and Jane (1867-1950) married in 1890. Pvt. Earl Roper served in Co. K, 65th Georiga Inf., CSA. as a scout on Walton's Mountain. He was shot in the hand, and the ball remained in his hand until he died. His service record indicates that he deserted. Family tradition holds that he may have switched sides on Walden Ridge, Tenn.</dc:description>
