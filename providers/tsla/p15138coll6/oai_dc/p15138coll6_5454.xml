<dc:title>Letter from Private William A. Johnson to Miss Nancy Hayes</dc:title>
<dc:description>Letter refers to being in camp and the health of the regiment being "good." They have "not yet entirely settled in winter quarters. Some say we will move 4 or 5 miles from this place but I think we will stay here for we have built brick chimneys to our white houses...I supposed a large force of Lincolnites are beyond Green river 35 or 40 miles north of Bowling Green. We have heard several times that they were advancin on us but they have not yet arrived." Johnson served in the 23rd Regt. Tenn Inf.</dc:description>
