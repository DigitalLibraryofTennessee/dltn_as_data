<dc:title>Letter from Joseph Warren Van Meter to his parents</dc:title>
<dc:description>In a four-page letter Joseph tells of high prices for staple foods, hats, whiskey, candy, and shoes. The men traveled through Tennessee, then "rold [sic] out like a Storm through Alabama&#8230;" At stops they were greeted by the "Fair Sex," who brought basket-fuls of food. Van Meter recounts the "big fight" at Perryville (Ky.) and his capture and exchange. He tells his parents if they never meet again, he will see them in heaven. Van Meter served in two regiments: 1st and 7th Arkansas."</dc:description>
