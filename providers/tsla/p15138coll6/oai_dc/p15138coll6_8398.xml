<dc:title>Henry V. Wilson's appointment as corporal in 20th Ohio Inf.</dc:title>
<dc:description>Appointment of Wilson at Vicksburg as corporal in the 20th Ohio Regiment of Veteran Volunteers after his re-enlistment. Volunteer Union regiments that mustered in at the outset of the war in 1861 were given the distinction as "Veteran; Volunteer" units if they had a certain percentage of men re-enlist when their terms ran out in 1863 and later. The men were also given a bonus and furlough for re-enlisting, which this record documents for Pvt. Wilson.</dc:description>
