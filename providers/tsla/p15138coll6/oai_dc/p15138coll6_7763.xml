<dc:title>Letter from Capt. Archibald D. Norris, Co. K, 7th Tenn. Inf. Regt., CSA to his father</dc:title>
<dc:description>Capt. Norris served in Co. K, 7th Tenn. Inf. Regt., CSA from Wilson County, which mustered in before TN seceded and was part of Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Writing to his father, Capt. Norris describes mostly "domestic" news from winter quarters near; Staunton, Va. Later in the war at Gettysburg, Norris' 7th was part of Pickett's Charge and was one of the few Confederate units to piece the Union line. Norris was credited with saving the regimental flag that day (July 3, 1863).</dc:description>
