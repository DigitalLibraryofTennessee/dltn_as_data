<dc:description>This postcard was sent from the Bureau of Pensions to the son-in-law of Pvt. Stephen Johnson, Co I., 4th Tennessee Cav., USA, to acknowledge the receipt of paperwork related to his Civil War pension. Johnson was a 30-year-old farmer who enrolled Jan. 17, 1864 in Cleveland, Tenn. and mustered in at Nashville that March. Sent to a convalescent camp on Nov. 24, 1864, he was absent without leave from Jan. 11 until Feb. 27, 1865 when he did not directly return to his unit. He mustered out July 12, 1865.</dc:description>
