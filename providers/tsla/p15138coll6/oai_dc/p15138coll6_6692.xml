Russell was at the Battle of Perryville, Ky., which "raged with intense fury." The Confederates "whiped the feds at Perryville and everywhere else in Kentucky." They returned to Tennesseebecause they could not get bread, though they had plenty of other supplies. Russell was later promoted to 1st Lt.</dc:description>
