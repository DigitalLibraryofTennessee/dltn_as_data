<dc:title>Minie balls found at Armour Farms</dc:title>
<dc:description>Minie balls found at the Armour Farms, east of Somerville, Tennessee, where the "Battle of the Cornstalks" was fought. The "Battle of the Cornstalks" was a skirmish that occurred about five miles from Somerville, Tennessee. Lt. Nathan Boone, commanding a group of about 60 Confederate soldiers, crossed a frosty corn field with his men. The company made so much noise that the Federal regiment they were up against, commanded by Colonel Prince, thought themselves to be outnumbered and retreated.</dc:description>
