<dc:title>George Franklin Robinson letter describing Battle of Gettysburg</dc:title>
<dc:description>Letter from George Franklin Robinson to his wife, Elvira Jane Griffin, following the Battle of Gettysburg, July 18, 1863. Robinson draws a map of his unit's march from Fredericksburg, Virginia, to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. In the letter, he says: "We gave 20 thousand men's lives for a few cattle, horses, and wagons. I think our Confederacy is gone up the spout. They say old Lee is going back into Maryland. If he does I think it will end the war. Our men had most as soon die as to start back to Maryland. Our men is badly disheartened; they are beginning to think this war wont end till we are all killed and it wont take long if they make many such raids   as this."</dc:description>
