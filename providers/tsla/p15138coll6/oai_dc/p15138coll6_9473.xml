<dc:title>Letter from James B. Owen to Sarah Bell</dc:title>
<dc:description>Two-page letter from Pvt. James B. Owen, Co. D, 31st Ill. Inf. Regt., USA to Sarah Bell. He writes that he is so glad to have heard from her and to know that she is well, as for so long he did not know what had become of her.; Some men have deserted the camp because they fear they are getting too old and "will not hold out long." Owen was from Brownsville, Ill. and died Sept. 3, 1863.</dc:description>
