<dc:title>Sword</dc:title>
<dc:description>This is a non-regulation sword, likely found in Georgia. Swords of this design were commonly used by military, fraternal, and para-military organizations from the 1850s to 1890s. This particular example features the standard US shield often seen in patriotic imagery of the late 1850s to 1860s time period. Weapons like this were often purchased from companies in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, or Cincinnati who offered a thriving mail-order business in the time period.</dc:description>
