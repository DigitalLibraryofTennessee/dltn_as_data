<dc:title>Mexican War Veteran Payment</dc:title>
<dc:description>This is a receipt from the United States Treasury Department for payment to George Washington McKenzie for his service in the 5th Tenn. Inf. Regt. in the Mexican-American War. McKenzie later served as colonel of the 5th Tenn. Cav. Regt., CSA. Tennessee provided six regiments to the Mexican-American War. Volunteers from East Tennessee constituted the 5th Tenn. Inf. Regt. Although deployed to Mexico, they arrived too late to see much fighting. They were assigned to guarding the supply lines.</dc:description>
