<dc:title>Photograph of William Stokely Hayes and Jonathan Pierce Bandy</dc:title>
<dc:description>Sgt. Jonathan Bandy (left), Co. K, 18th Tenn. Inf., CSA was from Gallatin, Tenn. and mustered in on Aug. 7, 1861 at Camp Trousdale. His best friend, William Stokely Hayes, CSA, is pictured beside him wearing a cap adorned with a rooster and feather. Family lore holds that Hayes was a bugler, and that Bandy was taken prisoner at the Battle of Talledega. This information is not in his service record, which states that he deserted Oct. 18, 1863, the month his unit was consolidated with the 26th Regt.</dc:description>
