<dc:title>Letter from Capt. Archibald D. Norris, Co. K, 7th Tenn. Inf. Regt., CSA to his father</dc:title>
<dc:description>Capt. Norris served in Co. K, 7th Tenn. Inf. Regt., CSA from Wilson County, which was part of Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. He speaks of depredations committed by Union forces in the area: "In this community they have departed from civilized to savage; warfare," referring to the Shenandoah Valley. He describes a "sharp quarrel" between Confederate Gen. Loring and Gen. Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson, as well as Gen. Anderson's effort to mediate in Richmond.</dc:description>
