<dc:title>Discharge and pension papers for Ephraim Lewis, veteran of the Mexican and Civil Wars</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pension certificate for Sarah J. Lewis, widow of Ephraim who was a private in Co. K, 5th Tenn. Inf. Regt. during the War with Mexico. Also, the discharge record of the same Ephraim who served in Co. F, 13th Tenn. Cav. Regt., USA during the Civil War. Lewis lived in Watauga in Carter County. Various increases in Sarah's monthly pension are recorded, up to $50/month by 1926. For her to still be collecting a pension from a Mexican War veteran, she must have married quite young to the old veteran.</dc:description>
