<dc:title>Non-Commissioned Officer breast plate</dc:title>
<dc:description>US Army eagle non-commissioned officer breast plate. It is lead filled and has three hooks on the rear for use on the NCO sword baldric. It was recovered from Readyville, Tennessee. According to army regulations non-commissioned officers (sergeants and corporals) wore a sword on a baldric. The baldric plate had hooks on the back which allowed the baldric strap to be adjusted. NCOs rarely carried swords on active campaign as they proved cumbersome.</dc:description>
