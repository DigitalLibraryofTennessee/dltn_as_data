<dc:title>Walking Stick</dc:title>
<dc:description>Each knot on this walking stick has a letter carved on it. Combined, the carving reads "We will hang Jeff Davis on a sour apple tree." At the top of the stick is a sleeping dog where it appears the word "TRAY" is inscribed, possibly in reference to the song "Old Dog Tray" written and composed by Stephen C. Foster. A name also appears to be inscribed near the dog. The first two initials appear to be "C.A." the last name is difficult to read but may be "Mc?  The year "1889" is carved on the piece.</dc:description>
