<dc:title>Refracting telescope</dc:title>
<dc:description>Refracting telescope captured by Federal troops during the Civil War. The Federal troops thought the telescope was the barrel of a brass cannon. It was originally purchased by C. J. Bradley in 1852 for Bethel College. The telescope cost almost $3000 when it was purchased new. A placard on the barrel of the telescope contains the following information: "Purchased by C. J. Bradley, D. D., 1852; Captured by Federal Soldiers, 1862; Returned by Federal Soldiers, 1865." W. W. Hendrix, D. D., 1872; Reparked through efforts of Will N. Calhoun, 1912."</dc:description>
