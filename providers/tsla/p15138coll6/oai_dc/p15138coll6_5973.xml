<dc:title>Letter from Pvt. James Ballard to his parents</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pvt. James E. Ballard, Co. A, 11th Miss. Inf., CSA, wrote of his longing to receive news from home, upset that he had only received two letters in seven months. He asked them to write to Richmond, and said that he would not write more until he received a letter from them. In the only lines not related to the lack of letters, Ballard wrote that "Deserters are coming over very fast" and that "Rosencranz's [Rosecrans'] Army is deserting by hundreds." Ballard died at the Battle of Gettysburg on July 3, 1863.</dc:description>
