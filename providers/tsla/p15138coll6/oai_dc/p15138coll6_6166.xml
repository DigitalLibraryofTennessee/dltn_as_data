<dc:title>Tintype of Lt. W. H. McCaskill</dc:title>
<dc:description>William H. McCaskill, Jr. 2nd Lt, Co. I, 12th Tenn. (Green's) Cav., CSA, of Fayette County, Tenn. posed in a military uniform with a frock coat, a brace of pistols in his belt. Of four brothers, he was one of two who survived the war. His pension application states that he joined in late 1863 and commanded a scouting party. He went home sick in 1864 and did not return to service. His name appears on one regimental roster (as Wm McKuskill) on February 6, 1864.</dc:description>
