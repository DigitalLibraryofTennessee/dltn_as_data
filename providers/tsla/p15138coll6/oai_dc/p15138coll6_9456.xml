<dc:title>Letter from James B. Owen to Sarah Bell</dc:title>
<dc:description>Two-page letter from Pvt. James B. Owen, Co. D, 31st Ill. Inf. Regt., USA to Sarah Bell. He speaks of their journey from Memphis and that over one hundred soldiers had deserted the day they left. He notes how beautiful Lake Providence is, that; his father would have a fine time fishing, as there "are no rebels on this side of the river." He ends the letter asking Sally to tell "mother" that "this is the place that Alfred Cook lived." Owen was from Brownsville, Ill. and died Sept. 3, 1863.</dc:description>
