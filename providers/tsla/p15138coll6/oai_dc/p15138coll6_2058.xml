<dc:title>Slave Memories from George Turner, as told to W. M. Organ Jr.</dc:title>
<dc:description>"Tales as told by one of the few remaining Ex Slaves in the South" from Liberty, Tennessee, in Cannon County. W. M. Organ Jr. worked with the Ford Motor Co., and Turner told Organ his story. 13 pages total. The old paper used was from an automobile catalogue. In 1963, the donor's neighbor did contract work in Liberty, Tennessee, and an old garage was torn down. In the old desk he found this document in an envelope. The actual narrative was allegedly dictated in around 1925.</dc:description>
