<dc:title>Letter from Quartermaster General about restitution claim</dc:title>
<dc:description>The Quartermaster General wrote R. J. Meigs about the restitution claim of Thomas Hord for the use of his home Elmwood as a hospital after the Battle of Stones River. Claim mentions thousands of pounds of cotton used as bedding for the wounded. Army regulations only authorized reimbursement for straw, not cotton, for bedding. The letter asks for clarification about the amount of cotton used, and for a certified voucher from the officer who took the house for a hospital with details about its occupation.</dc:description>
