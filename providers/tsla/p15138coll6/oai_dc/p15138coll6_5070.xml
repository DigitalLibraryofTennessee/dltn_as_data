<dc:title>Letter from Tom Hord to Amelia Hord</dc:title>
<dc:description>Writing to his wife Amelia after his arrival in New Orleans, Hord described travel difficulties and plans to visit friends. He heard that Tennessee had voted by a majority of more than fifty thousand not to call a convention for secession. Hord also wrote of the uncertain situation in Louisiana. "If people will permit demagogues to trifle with their rights   they deserve to be, and sooner or later, most assuredly, will be slaves, as they have been dupes."</dc:description>
