<dc:description>Often called the "Father of Tennessee," John Sevier was born in Virginia, but eventually moved to Washington County, North Carolina [later Tennessee]. He and Shelby became heroes after they led their armies of patriot- settlers to victory at the Battle of Kings Mountain (1780). Sevier became Tennessee's first governor, serving three terms (1796-1801). Shelby became Kentucky's first and fifth governor (1792-1796 &amp; 1812-1816).</dc:description>
