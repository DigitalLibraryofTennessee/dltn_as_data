<dc:description>Henry Dixon, (ca. 1750 - 17 July 1782), was a Revolutionary War officer, born in the part of Granville County that later became Orange and then Caswell. In 1763 he married Martha Wynne in Halifax County, Va. Dixon was commissioned captain of the First Regiment and charged to form North Carolina's first units of the Continental line in September 1775. In 1778 the North Carolina legislature appointed Dixon "Inspector General over Militia," a post he held for the remainder of the war.  He worked with Generals Jethro Sumner and Nathaniel Greene in the defense of the southern states.
