<dc:description>Minutemen were from the American colonial militia during the Revolutionary War. They provided highly mobile, rapidly deployed force that allowed the colonies to respond immediately to war threats. Minutemen were chosen from the ranks of the militia muster rolls by their commanding officers and were the first armed militia to arrive or await battle.  Although today they are thought of in relation to the American Revolutionary War, their existence can be traced back to the mid-seventeenth century.</dc:description>
