<dc:description>Edward Van Altena  was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1873, but his family moved to Brooklyn, New York, when he was five years old.  In 1888, he began working for a photography studio.  In 1904, he entered into partnership with John Duer Scott to produce hand colored slides with Van Altena doing the photography work, Van Altena died in 1968.  Glass lantern slides were introduced in 1849, ten years after the invention of photography. Lantern slides operate as a transparent slide projected onto a surface, allowing the photograph to be seen by small groups and also larger audiences.</dc:description>
