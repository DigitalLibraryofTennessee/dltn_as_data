<dc:description>Written from "Peek's Kill," New York, where the Continental Army had established headquarters. The town was an important manufacturing center, and the mills there provided gunpowder and leather. Its location on the Hudson River was a strategic advantage for the Americans. Return Jonathan Meigs led the successful raid on Sag Harbor, New York, in 1777 without losing a man. He later served with distinction under General Anthony Wayne. After the war, Meigs moved to Tennessee when he was appointed government agent to the Cherokees. As agent, he showed great sympathy for the Cherokees.</dc:description>
