<dc:description>Often called the "Father of Tennessee," John Sevier was born in Virginia but later moved to Washington County, Tennessee (then a part of North Carolina). Sevier became a hero after he, Shelby, and Campbell led armed settlers against the British at the Battle of Kings Mountain (1780). In 1796, Sevier was elected Tennessee's first governor.</dc:description>
