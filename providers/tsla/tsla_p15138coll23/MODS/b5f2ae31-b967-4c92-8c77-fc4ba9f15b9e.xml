   <abstract>Hand-drawn map of delaying action fought by Gen. Nathan B. Forrest's cavalry, in which John Johnston served, on December 17, 1864. Johnston's map crudely shows the terrain on which Forrest's cavalry made a stand on the north side of the West Fork of the Harpeth River against Union infantry pursuing remnants of Hood's Army of Tennessee. Confederate forces had been routed the day before in front of Nashville, and Forrest's stand helped some of them to escape to the south. Features include the positioning of Union infantry line near Winstead Hill, the "scene of our rally" at the Harpeth, and "my route" to the Gin House.</abstract>
   <abstract>John Johnston was born in 1842 and joined the Confederate army in April 1861. He later served in Nathan Bedford Forrest's cavalry during the war. Following the war he became a lawyer in Memphis and wrote a memoir of his experiences during the Civil War. He died in 1928.</abstract>
