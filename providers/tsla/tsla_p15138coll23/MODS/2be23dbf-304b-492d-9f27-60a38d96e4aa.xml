   <abstract>This is the third version of this map published by Jefferys. It depicts the English colonies on the eve of the revolution. Colonial boundaries are hand-colored, and, as in Dunn's map, New England is colored as one large unit, however the subdivisions are included as dotted lines. Many old French forts are included and listed as ruined. Rivers, lakes, mountains, towns are shown. Native lands and towns are depicted in great detail.</abstract>
   <abstract>Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville was born in Paris in 1697. He published his first map at the age of fifteen, and was appointed as a geographer to the King of France by the age of twenty-two. According to Hugh Chisholm, the author of his Encyclopedia Britannica entry, d'Anville advocated for rigorous skepticism regarding maps. He avoided the common practice of copying earlier maps and often performed empirical study of the land. He died in 1782.</abstract>
