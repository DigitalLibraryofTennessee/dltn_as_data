   <abstract>John Melish's map of the southern theater of the War of 1812. State and national borders are denoted and hand-colored. Highly detailed view of the rivers, roads, and forts throughout the Southeast, including a detailed rendering of the Natchez Trace with mileage markers. Towns, settlements, and Native American villages are shown, as are tribal lands. Important sites of the Creek War in the Mississippi Territory, such as Ft. Strother, Ft. Deposit, McGil[le]vray Town and McIntoshville, are shown. Annotations such as "Pike's exploring party stop[p]ed here" and "The alligators go no further north" are found in the Louisiana and Missouri territories. Indian boundary lines are visible in Illinois and Indiana territories.</abstract>
   <abstract>John Melish, a Scottish cartographer, moved to the United States in 1811. Shortly thereafter he began a cartography business and published his first map, along with Henry Tanner, in 1813, depicting the War of 1812. After the war, he began work on a comprehensive map of the United States and, with consultation from Thomas Jefferson, produced the first American-made map showing America from coast to coast. In the late 1810s and early 1820s he produced many state maps simultaneously with his nation-wide ones. He is considered to be one of, if not the most important of the early mapmakers in America. His map of the United States, first published in 1816, visualized the continentalist belief held by many Americans during this era. The map was used as a propaganda piece in the "manifest destiny" era of the 1840s.</abstract>
