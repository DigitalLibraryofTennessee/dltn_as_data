   <abstract>Plate L of the Atlas to Accompany the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, 1861-1865, containing six small maps relating to battles and troop positions during the Civil War. Five of the maps are of the Chattanooga area during the late 1863 campaign while the sixth is from the Red River expedition in Louisiana in 1864. The detailed maps are complete with troop placement, battle lines and geographic details such as rivers, streams, roads, railroads. Clockwise from bottom left: Battle of Lookout Mountain; Country in Vicinity of Brown's Ferry; Battlefield of Missionary Ridge; Positions of Second Division, Fourth Army Corps; Red River Expedition; Chattanooga and Vicinity.</abstract>
   <abstract>Following their victory at the Battle of Chickamauga, General Braxton Bragg's Army of Tennessee chased Union forces under Major General William Rosecrans to Chattanooga. The Union settled behind the defenses in the city, while the Confederates occupied the surrounding high ground. Major General Ulysses S. Grant was given command of Federal forces in the western theater, and was joined with reinforcements. On October 27, the Union were able to open a "Cracker Line" at Brown's Ferry to resupply their troops. After small battles at Wauhatchie and Orchard Knob, Major General Joseph Hooker launched an assault, overrunning Confederate positions on Lookout Mountain on November 24th, just in time to assist Grant's advance on Bragg's position at Missionary Ridge. The result was a resounding victory for the Union, crushing the Confederates' hopes that emerged from their victory at Chickamauga. Chattanooga became the supply center for General William T. Sherman's Atlanta Campaign.</abstract>
