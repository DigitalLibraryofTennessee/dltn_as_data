   <abstract>Plate 9 of the 1889 Atlas of Nashville detailing the area near Vanderbilt University. The school's campus is shown including Wesley Hall, Science Hall, the chancellor's residence, the president's house, various dormitories, and the gymnasium. The large estate of Samuel M. Murphy, whom the Davidson County trustee listed as the second wealthiest Nashvillian in 1897, is seen just north of Vanderbilt. The old State Fairgrounds, now called West Side Park and later Centennial Park after Nashville's Centennial Exposition was held there in 1897, is included. Various other tracts and additions to the city are drawn.</abstract>
   <abstract>Griffith Morgan Hopkins was born around 1836, however the exact date is unknown. He first began printing maps in 1857 and continued until his retirement in 1900. He founded G. M. Hopkins &amp; Co. with his brother Henry W. Hopkins, and together they produced many city and county atlases, primarily of the northeast, from their shop in Philadelphia. Their 1908 Atlas of Nashville is a fine, block-by-block depiction of the town in a period of growth to a modern urban center. G. M. Hopkins &amp; Co. continued on after the founders' retirements until the Great Depression ended the demand for their atlases. The company was sold to the Franklin Survey Company in 1943, with the name intact, due to its association with quality.</abstract>
