   <abstract>"A map of the British American plantations, extending from Boston in New England to Georgia; including all the back settlements in the respective provinces as far as the Mississippi." An exceptional map of the American colonies and backcountry published in London at the time of the French &amp; Indian War. It shows the territory of the "Cherakees" "Chikasas" and Upper Creeks with their towns and villages, including the site of "Tanase" from which the future state's name derived. On the Cumberland River is shown “Walkers Settlement 1750,” possibly a reference to the French Lick trading outpost and Dr. Thomas Walker’s 1750 exploration down the Cumberland. What was later called the Tennessee River is named the “Hugehego or Akansea R[iver]” on which an upstream “English Fort"—probably Fort Loudoun—is indicated.</abstract>
   <abstract>Emanuel Bowen was an English map maker in the 18th century. He produced many well-known maps of the American colonies as well as county maps of England. His son was map maker Thomas Bowen. Two of his apprentices were renowned cartographers Thomas Kitchin and Thomas Jefferys. He served as geographer to King George II of England and Louis XV of France.</abstract>
