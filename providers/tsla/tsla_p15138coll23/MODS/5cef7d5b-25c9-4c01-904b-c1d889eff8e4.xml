   <abstract>Map created by the United States Geological Survey showing the soil composition of Meigs County. This very detailed map names schools, churches, stores, and all ferries and landings on the Tennessee and Hiwassee rivers. It also shows every house structure in the county as well as towns, roads, rivers, and creeks.</abstract>
   <abstract>The United States Geological Survey was established in 1879, with Clarence King named as its first director. Its primary mission was the "classification of the public lands, and examination of the geological structure, mineral resources, and products of the national domain," as stated by the act of Congress that created it. The huge swaths of land acquired from the Mexican-American War and Louisiana Purchase had yet to be adequately inventoried, prompting this legislation.</abstract>
