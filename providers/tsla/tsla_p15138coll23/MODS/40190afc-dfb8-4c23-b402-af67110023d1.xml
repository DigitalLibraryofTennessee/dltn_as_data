   <abstract>This map, along with his other county maps, may have been used by Rhea to make his seminal map of the State of Tennessee with cousin Joseph Campbell Rhea. Jefferson County had been a part of Caswell County during the State of Franklin period (1784-1789) and was later established as its own county in 1792. Cocke County was established in 1797 from a part of Jefferson County and was named for William Cocke, one of the state's first Senators.</abstract>
