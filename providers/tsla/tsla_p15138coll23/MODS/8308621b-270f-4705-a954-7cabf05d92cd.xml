   <abstract>This hand-drawn colorful map provides rivers, creeks, and areas that were previously occupied by the Chickasaws. In addition, the map offers symbols that indicate the early settlements of the county such as the first school established in Hardin County in 1821, the first church in Hardin County, and the location of the first county seat.</abstract>
   <abstract>The Jackson Purchase included the area of West Tennessee and southwestern Kentucky between the Tennessee and Mississippi Rivers. This area had historically belonged to the Chickasaws but was ceded in the Treaty of Tecumseh. The treaty with the Chickasaws was negotiated by Andrew Jackson and Issac Shelby in 1818. In 1819, the Jackson Purchase region was opened for settlement and the General Assembly created Hardin County. Hardin County was named after Colonel Joseph Hardin who served as a reprensentative of Washington and Greene counties in the State of Franklin and in the Tennessee Territorial Assembly.</abstract>
