   <abstract>This map shows portions of the East Tennessee coal and iron fields, most famously the Coal Creek mines near Clinton, Tenn. where armed miners fought pitched battle against hired mine guards and the Tennessee State Guard in 1892, an episode known as the Coal Creek Rebellion. Coal mining in this remote district on the Anderson-Campbell County line was made possible by construction of the connecting link with the Cincinnati Southern Railroad shown in Killebrew's map. Oliver Springs coal fields and salt works, iron ore deposits, and Sharp's Forge near Jacksboro also shown.</abstract>
   <abstract>Map taken from first Tennessee Commissioner of Agriculture Joseph B. Killebrew's pathbreaking 1876 Resources of Tennessee. At the time of the publication of this book, the Cincinnati Southern Railroad was nearing completion of its intended line from Cincinnati, Ohio to Chattanooga, Tenn.; it intersected with the Knoxville &amp; Ohio Railroad at Careyville. The railroad was a reflection of Cincinnati's efforts to fortify its commercial position in the South. This map depicts the terrain of the famous 1892 Coal Creek Rebellion, one of the earliest actions of American miners against the use of leased convicts to break strikes in the coal fields.</abstract>
