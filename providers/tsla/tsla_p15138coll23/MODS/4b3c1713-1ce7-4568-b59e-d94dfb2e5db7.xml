   <abstract>This map from the McKenzie &amp; Son Mountain District Land Records shows water courses, towns, entries and grants, roads, cities, springs, mineral deposits and the Cincinnati Southern Railroad. Range and section lines shown, as are the names of some grantees, along with grant and entry numbers for certain tracts. Important historic features include the Old Walton Road, Old Bledsoe Stand, Old Johnson Stand, and the Old Nashville Road.</abstract>
   <abstract>Maps drawn by the surveying firm of McKenzie and Son of Chattanooga, 1880-1916, were generally used as exhibits in litigation in which Mountain District land grants were involved. These grants and this district were particularly prone to fraud and overlapping claims, such that surveyors were called in to help adjudicate disputes with the help of such maps.</abstract>
