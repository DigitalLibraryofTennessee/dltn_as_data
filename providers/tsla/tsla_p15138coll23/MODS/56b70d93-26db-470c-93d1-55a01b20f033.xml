   <abstract>Hand-drawn map of Dyer County showing civil districts, rivers, creeks, and lakes. Wood Lake, the remnant of a much longer waterway apparently created in the wake of the 1812-13 New Madrid earthquakes, is shown in two parts along with other old sloughs and channels from the former course of the Mississippi River. Key Corner, a famous landmark first designated by Henry Rutherford in his 1785 surveying expedition through West Tennessee (then Chickasaw territory), is also shown on the Forked Deer River. Range and section lines and numbers are indicated, as are early civil district boundaries.</abstract>
   <abstract>These 1836 county maps showing the new civil districts, required by the new state constitution, written in 1834 and ratified the following year, which mandated such civil divisions for taxation purposes, were done for many counties. Dyer County was established in 1823 from lands purchased from the Chickasaw in 1818. It was named for War of 1812 veteran Robert Henry Dyer. Its county seat and largest city is Dyersburg. Timber was the leading industry in the county until the 1920s when agriculture surpassed it.</abstract>
