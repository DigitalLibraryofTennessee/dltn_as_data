   <abstract>Hand-colored steel-engraved map of the Eastern United States illustrating principal travelling roads, major cities and towns, native american towns, distances between cities, rivers, forts, salt works, canals, and railroads. Inset maps include the vicinities of the cities of Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, Charleston, New York, Cincinnati, Albany and New Orleans. Native American tribes are shown in their post-resettlement location in Indian Territory, with various cantonments and salt works. Arkansas and Michigan are territories, and Mexico is shown just west of the Sabine River, the western boundary of Louisiana.</abstract>
   <abstract>Travel became much easier in the United States during the period of Industrialization. The speed of the steamboats decreased travel times between ports and cities as well as decreased costs for transporting goods. Steamboat technology was applied to steam engines for faster land travel and was an integral part to the establishment of the railroad system throught the country.</abstract>
