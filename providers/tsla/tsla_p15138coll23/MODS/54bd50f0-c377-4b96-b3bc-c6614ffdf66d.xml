   <abstract>Hand-drawn map of Carroll County, Tennessee, outlining civil districts. Each district is numbered and the only other feature on the sketch is the town of Huntingdon. 1900 cloth copy has same number. Also included are the descriptive surveyors notes.</abstract>
   <abstract>These 1836 county maps showing the new civil districts, required by the new state constitution, written in 1834 and ratified the following year, which mandated such civil divisions for taxation and election purposes, were done for many counties. Carroll County was created in 1821 from land ceded by the Chickasaw in the Jackson Purchase of 1818. It is named for Major General and governor, William Carroll. Its county seat is Huntingdon, named for Memucan Hunt, North Carolina State Treasurer and original landowner of the area that makes up Huntingdon. The county's largest city is McKenzie, named for the family that owned the land from which the city grew.</abstract>
