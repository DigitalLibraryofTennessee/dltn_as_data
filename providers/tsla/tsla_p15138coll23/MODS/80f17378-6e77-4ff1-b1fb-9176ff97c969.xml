   <abstract>Hand-drawn map of Wayne County, Tennessee showing the new civil districts. The towns of Waynesboro, Carrollville, and Shanonville [Shannonsville]. Some residences are specifically denoted by squares, probably indicating electoral polling places for those districts, including A. Brown, P Hask[Hash?], Powell's, Hardy's, and Pickens[?]. Geographic features such as creeks, rivers, valleys, and possibly iron furnace ponds on Boyd's Creek are included. The detail of creeks is of particular note. William B. Ross, one of the earliest settlers of the land signed the document as on of the county commissioners.</abstract>
   <abstract>These 1836 county maps showing the new civil districts, required by the new state constitution, written in 1834 and ratified the following year, which mandated such civil divisions for taxation and election purposes, were done for many counties. Wayne County was established in 1817 from parts of Hickman and Humphreys counties. It is named after General Anthony Wayne, a brigadier general in the American Revolution. Its largest city is Clifton and its county seat is Waynesboro.</abstract>
