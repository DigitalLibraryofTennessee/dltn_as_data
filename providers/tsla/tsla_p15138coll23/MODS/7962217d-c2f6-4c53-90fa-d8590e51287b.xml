   <abstract>This hand-drawn map was used as an exhibit in the Tennessee Supreme Court homicide case State of Tennessee v. Lennie Kendall. It shows residences and roads in the African American neighborhood of Savannah known as ""Stringtown." The shooting site and residences relevant to the case are named, while African American residences, church and schoolhouse in the neighborhood are denoted by the letter N." The Savannah Cemetery and Savannah and Hamburg Road are also featured in this depiction."</abstract>
   <abstract>The victim in this case was a white man, Jim Young, killed by a 22 year old ""negro boy," Lennie Kendall.""Because of the apprehension of mob violence," the venue was changed to Henderson, Tenn. The killing was in Savannah, Tenn., in June 1916. Defendant and deceased were romantically involved with Bertha Williams, and some of the principals were accused of bootlegging and lewdness.</abstract>
