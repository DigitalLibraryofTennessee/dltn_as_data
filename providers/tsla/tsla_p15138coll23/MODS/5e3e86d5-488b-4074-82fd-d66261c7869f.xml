   <abstract>This exhaustive map of the Mid-Atlantic region shows the cities, towns, roads, courthouses, mills, camps, forts, mines, and trade routes of the area. Geographic features include rivers, creeks, mountains, springs, bays, islands, swamps, and inlets. Some landowners are denoted. The map was the first to depict the parallel ranges of the Appalachian Mountains, and the headwaters of the Catawba and Yadkin rivers in North Carolina. The cartouche, often considered among the most attractive of the 18th century, depicts Virginia's tobacco trade on many levels, from enslaved labor, to drying and warehousing, to selling and shipping across the Atlantic.</abstract>
   <abstract>The Fry-Jefferson map was a landmark in early American mapmaking. It is the most important 18th century map of the Mid-Atlantic region for its detail, depiction of the Virginia and North Carolina waterways, and delineation of the Appalachian Mountains. Joshua Fry was a surveyor and mathematics professor at William and Mary. Peter Jefferson was a surveyor and mapmaker, and the father of President Thomas Jefferson. Around 1750, George Dunk, the Earl of Halifax, and the Board of Trade requested a detailed map of the Virginia colony, so Governor Lewis Burwell commissioned Fry and Jefferson to complete the task. The Board of Trade paid the pair Â£150 for their work. Thomas Jefferys originally published the map in 1753 on four copper plates. This edition is from 1775 and printed in Jefferys's American Atlas on two plates. Francis Hayman and Charles Grignion engraved the cartouche. (Farrell, Cassandra Britt. Fry-Jefferson Map of Virginia.
