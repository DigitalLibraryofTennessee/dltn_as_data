   <abstract>Houston County was created in 1871 from parts of Dickson, Humphreys and Stewart counties. It is named for Tennessee governor and Texas independence hero Sam Houston. Its county seat and largest town is Erin, named for its inhabitant's Irish heritage. The timber industry has been and is one of the largest industries in the county. The 1930s county maps by the state Division of Geology are the most revealing of the early 20th century economic and historical geography of Tennessee.</abstract>
