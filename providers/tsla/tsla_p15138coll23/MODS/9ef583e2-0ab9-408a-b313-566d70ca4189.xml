   <abstract>This map illustrates railroad and steamboat routes of Tennessee that were operating or being built in the 1850s. Lines and routes are named along with the land distances from town to town. Two insets show more detailed environs of Nashville and Knoxville. This map was originally published in Mitchell's "New Universal Atlas."</abstract>
   <abstract>This map helps convey the impact of the surge of railroad building that was taking place in the 1850s across the nation, and, specifically, in Tennessee. These early forays would give way to great railway systems that would improve transportation, aid the growth of the national economy, and play a key role in the Civil War.</abstract>
