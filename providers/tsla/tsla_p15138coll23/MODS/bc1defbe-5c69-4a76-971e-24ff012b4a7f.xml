   <abstract>This map from the McKenzie &amp; Son Mountain District Land Records shows names of grantees, land entry numbers and acreage for a number of tracts in the vicinity of Tracy City, Jasper and Chattanooga, as well as towns, roads,and ferries. Geographic features include creeks, caves, mountains, rivers, coves, and mineral deposits. An entry for the University of the South is included.</abstract>
   <abstract>Maps drawn by the surveying firm of McKenzie and Son of Chattanooga, 1880-1916, were generally used as exhibits in litigations in which Mountain District land grants were involved. These grants and this district were particularly prone to fraud and overlapping claims, such that surveyors were called in to help adjudicate disputes with the help of such maps.</abstract>
