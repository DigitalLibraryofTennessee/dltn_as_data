   <abstract>TSLA holds a large collection of these WWII "newsmaps" detailing for the American public the weekly events of US military efforts in Europe and the Pacific theaters. The Bureau of Public Relations was established in the Office of the Secretary of War in February 1941. The Bureau served as the central War Department agency to determine policies and procedures for disseminating military information to the public. After August 1942, it was also responsible for the public relations activities of the Army Air Forces, the Army Service Forces and the Army Ground Forces. During the war, the Bureau produced these weekly newsmaps for War Department distribution.</abstract>
