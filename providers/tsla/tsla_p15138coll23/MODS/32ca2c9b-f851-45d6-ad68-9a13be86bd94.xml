   <abstract>Map of a portion of Alabama from Albert James Pickett's History of Alabama, 3rd edition, 1851. The map depicts the Mobile River, Tombigby River, and Alabama River as well as various creeks. Roads, forts (including Fort Mims), ferries, landings, and camps are all shown. The site of Aaron Burr's arrest and the site of the "canoe fight" are also included.</abstract>
   <abstract>The Creek War (1813-1814) was a sub-conflict of the War of 1812, but for most Tennesseans the Creek War was the War of 1812. With the noticeable exception of the campaign at New Orleans, the battles fought in the Creek conflict represented the majority of fighting by Tennessee troops. Most Tennessee deaths and casualties occurred during the Creek War. Iconic figures such as Sam Houston and David Crockett fought the Red Sticks, the warring faction of the Creek Nation, although neither man had yet to achieve any fame. The Creek War established Andrew Jackson as a household name, and his victories prompted officials in Washington to promote him to major general in the U.S. Army. This promotion placed him in command at New Orleans and set him on a road to immortal fame. The land seized from the Creek following the war began the final era of land cessions in the southeast that culminated in forced removal in the 1830s.</abstract>
