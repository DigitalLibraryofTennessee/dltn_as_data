   <abstract>Hand-drawn map of Gibson County showing the newly established civil districts. Big Creek and forks of the Obion and Forked Deer River are drawn. The map includes sketches of the Parris [Paris] Road, Huntingdon Road, Lexington Road, Jackson Road, Temperance Road, Poplar Corner Road, Brownsville Road, Eaton Road, Troy Road and Dresden Road radiating from Trenton. Included are the descriptive surveyors notes--metes and bounds--delineating civil district boundary lines.</abstract>
   <abstract>These 1836 county maps showing the new civil districts, required by the new state constitution, written in 1834 and ratified the following year, which mandated such civil divisions for taxation and election purposes, were done for many counties. Gibson County was formed in 1823 from a part of Carroll County. It is named for Col. John H. Gibson, a veteran of the War of 1812 and Creek Wars. Its county seat is Trenton, named after Trenton, New Jersey, while its largest city is Humboldt, named for Prussian naturalist and geographer Alexander von Humboldt.</abstract>
