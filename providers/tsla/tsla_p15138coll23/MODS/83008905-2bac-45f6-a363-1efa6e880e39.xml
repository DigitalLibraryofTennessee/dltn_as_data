   <abstract>Hand-drawn map of Obion County that outlines the newly established civil districts. Wood Lake (a larger, earthquake-formed predecessor of Reelfoot Lake) is shown along with roads through the county and the Obion River. Included are the descriptive metes and bounds delineating civil district boundary lines for ""the purpose of electing," i.e. polling districts. Troy was the county seat at this time.</abstract>
   <abstract>These 1836 county maps showing the new civil districts, required by the new state constitution, written in 1834 and ratified the following year, which mandated such civil divisions for taxation and election purposes, were done for many counties. Obion County was created in 1823 from land purchased from the Chickasaw in 1818. It is named for the Obion River, possibly taken from a Native American word meaning ""many forks." Its county seat and largest city is Union City named for the junction of the Nashville and Northwestern Railroad and the Mobile and Ohio Railroad, from which the city grew.</abstract>
