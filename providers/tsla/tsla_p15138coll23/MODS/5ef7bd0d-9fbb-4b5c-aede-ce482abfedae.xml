   <abstract>Hand-drawn map of parts of McMinn, Monroe, Rhea, and Roane counties, the so-called Hiawassee District created by the 1819 treaty with the Cherokee. Township and section lines are shown. Shows the towns of Athens, Philadelphia, Tellico, Calhoun, and Tallassee. Other important features include gold deposits, iron ore, iron works, the Cherokee Agency, ferries, roads (incl. the important Unicoi turnpike), a slate quarry, Sweetwater College, Tellico Plains, and a factory. Geographic features such as rivers and creeks are shown and labeled and mountains are shown with relief markings. Cherokee lands are noted to the south. Parts of the map are missing. Stage route distances noted on reverse.</abstract>
   <abstract>This map, along with his other county maps, may have been used by Matthew Rhea to make his seminal map of the State of Tennessee (with cousin Joseph Campbell Rhea) for Eastin Morris's 1834 Tennessee gazetteer. McMinn County was created in 1819 from Cherokee lands. Monroe County was also established in 1819ï¿½after the Cherokee relinquished claims to lands stretching from the Little Tennessee River south to the Hiwassee River.</abstract>
