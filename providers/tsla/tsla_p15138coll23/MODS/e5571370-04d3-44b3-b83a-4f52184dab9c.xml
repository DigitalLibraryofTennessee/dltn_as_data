   <abstract>This hand-drawn map is an exhibit in the Tennessee Supreme Court case of The Cumberland Presbyterian Church of Fosterville v. Equitable Insurance Company of Nashville, arising from a destructive tornado that tore through the Rutherford County town in 1890. It is a pre-storm rendering of houses and structures in central Fosterville, Tennessee, showing buildings damaged or destroyed in the "pathway of cyclone," represented by a red swath. It names the businesses, churches, stores, and dwellings, as well as roads. The Nashville, Chattanooga, and St. Louis Railroad runs straight through the middle of town. A small print of the church is included in the bottom left-hand corner.</abstract>
   <abstract>On the night of March 30, 1890, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church of Fosterville, Tennessee was destroyed by a "cyclone." The church was insured for lightning damage only by the Equitable Insurance Company of Nashville. The insurance company refused to pay for damages, arguing that the church was destroyed by a cyclone, not lightning.</abstract>
