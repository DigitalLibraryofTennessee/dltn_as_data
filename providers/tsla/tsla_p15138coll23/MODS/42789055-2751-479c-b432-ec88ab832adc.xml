   <abstract>This surveyor's district covered the southwest corner of the newly acquired west Tennessee--present-day Tipton, Haywood, Shelby, Fayette counties--and shows range and section lines, streams and general soil qualities ("1st rate,""2nd rate," etc." West Tennessee had just been acquired from the Chickasaw, so there are no settlements or towns. Because these surveyor district maps were produced by official state surveyors to facilitate the location of public land entries and grants, they are divided into equidistant townships and sections.</abstract>
   <abstract>The twelve district surveyors maps were produced as Indian treaties and land cessions opened up new territory for state land sales--the location of which "grants" was their chief purpose.</abstract>
