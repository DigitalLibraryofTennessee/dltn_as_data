   <abstract>Map of western France, and parts of Germany, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg during the Napoleonic Wars. Each of the French 'departements' (incl. those in occupied Rhineland) are shown in color, along with cities, roads, and railroads. Geographic features such as mountains, rivers, lakes, channels, and oceans are indicated. An inset of Malta is included with a description of General Napoleon Bonaparte's capture of the island. This is a detailed French map of Central Europe near the height of Napoleon's military conquests.</abstract>
   <abstract>Jacques Esnauts and Michel Rapilly ran a printing and publishing firm in Paris in the 18th Century. They were the originators of colored fashion plates for men and women, producing a collection known as Galerie des Modes et costumes Francais. The pair printed maps as well, including plans of Paris and other French cities, and maps of America during the Revolutionary War. Rapilly died in 1797 and Esnauts continued to produce maps such as this one until his death in 1813.</abstract>
