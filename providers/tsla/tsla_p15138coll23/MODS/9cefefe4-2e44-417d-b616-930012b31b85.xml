   <abstract>This hand-drawn map shows the boundary lines for James County in 1871, the year the county was officially established. The town of Ooltewah (the county seat) is shown, as are Chattanooga and Cleveland situated beyond the boundaries. The total area for James County was approximately 330 square miles.</abstract>
   <abstract>Predominantly white, rural, and poor, James County arose out of the political factionalism of the Reconstruction Era. In 1871, Representative Elbert A. James, a Democrat from Hamilton County, introduced legislation for the formation of the county, named in honor of his father, Rev. Jesse J. James. The elder James, a Methodist minister from Sullivan County, first moved to Chattanooga in the 1850s. Three days after Rep. James introduced his bill, the Tennessee General Assembly passed the act creating James County on Jan. 30, 1871. Lawmakers chose Ooltewah as the county seat, and subsequently citizens began work on building a county courthouse. Following 19 years of meager existence, state lawmakers passed an act on March 11, 1890 abolishing the county and returning the land to the parent counties of Hamilton and Bradley.</abstract>
