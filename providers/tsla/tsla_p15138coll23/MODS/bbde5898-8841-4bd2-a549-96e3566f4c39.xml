   <abstract>This map covers parts of Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Mexico. It shows drainage, military posts, forts, Native American reservations, heliograph stations and communications, telegraph lines, "Indian fights", railroads, roads, boundaries, and a list of authorities. Geographic features include springs, creeks, rivers, lakes, and mountain ranges.</abstract>
   <abstract>The Chiricahua are a band of Apache that lived in the area depicted by the map. Following the Mexican-American War and Gadsden Purchase, the influx of Americans to their homeland accelerated, exacerbating tensions. From 1861 until 1886, the Apache Wars ravaged the Southwest United States. On top of growing tensions, the US Army killed some of Cochise's relatives in 1861, an event known as the Bascom Affair. Cochise, a principal chief of a band of the Chiricahua Apache, waged a guerilla war to avenge his relatives' deaths. After a decade of fighting, the Chiricahua signed a peace treaty with the United States which created a reservation in present-day New Mexico and Arizona. Cochise died of natural causes in 1874. Many Chiricahua found life in their new desert home difficult and began leaving. Under a popular resistance leader, Geronimo, they occasionally raided nearby settlements until their surrender to General Nelson A. Miles in 1886.</abstract>
