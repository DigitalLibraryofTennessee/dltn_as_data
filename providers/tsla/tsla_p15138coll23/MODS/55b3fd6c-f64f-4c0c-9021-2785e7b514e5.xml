   <abstract>Map and field call description of Washington County civil district boundaries. Each district is named and numbered. County lines are drawn. Other features include Looking Glass Mountain, the Watauga River, Nolichucky River, and Buffalo Mountain.</abstract>
   <abstract>These 1836 county maps showing the new civil districts, required by the new state constitution, written in 1834 and ratified the following year, which mandated such civil divisions for taxation and election purposes, were done for many counties. Washington County is Tennessee's oldest county, organizing itself as the Washington District in the early 1770s until it was annexed by North Carolina and officially dubbed Washington County in 1777. It was a part of the failed State of Franklin in the 1780s, and the territory south of the River Ohio in the 1790s, before ultimately joining Tennessee after admittance to the Union in 1796. It is named for General and President George Washington. Its county seat is Jonesborough, named for North Carolina statesman Willie Jones, while its largest city is Johnson City, is named for an early settler, Henry Johnson. Johnson City briefly changed its name to Haynesville during the Civil War to honor Confederate senator Landon Carter Haynes.</abstract>
