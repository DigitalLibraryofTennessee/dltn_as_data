   <abstract>Hand-drawn and colored map showing the new civil districts of Bradley County. The maps details the Hiwassee River and its tributaries, naming certain creeks and springs. It denotes certain structures including residences, schoolhouses, springs, and ferries that make up certain boundaries. Features such as Bateses Plantation, Grasshoppers, Hambright's and Patten's ferries are indicated. Also shown is the "Camp below Calhoun's," in reference to the US Army's marshalling or concentration of Cherokee at a guarded site near the Indian agency on the Hiwassee River in preparation for the 1838 Removal. This was the future site of Fort Cass. The table in the upper right lists the election precincts for each civil district.</abstract>
   <abstract>These 1836 county maps showing the new civil districts, required by the new state constitution, written in 1834 and ratified the following year, which mandated such civil divisions for taxation purposes, were done for many counties. Bradley County was established in 1836 from the Ocoee District of Cherokee territory. It is named for Revolutionary War and War of 1812 veteran, Colonel Edward Bradley. Its county seat and largest city is Cleveland, named for a commander at the Battle of King's Mountain, Colonel Benjamin Cleveland. Bradley County was one of the many East Tennessee counties that voted against secession during the outbreak of the Civil War.</abstract>
