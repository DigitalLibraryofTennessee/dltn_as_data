   <abstract>Following their victory at the Battle of Chickamauga, General Braxton Bragg’s Army of Tennessee chased Union forces under Major General William Rosecrans to Chattanooga. The Union settled behind the defenses in the city, while the Confederates occupied the surrounding high ground. Major General Ulysses S. Grant was given command of Federal forces in the western theater, and was joined with reinforcements. On October 27, the Union were able to open a “Cracker Line” at Brown’s Ferry to resupply their troops. After small battles at Wauhatchie and Orchard Knob, Major General Joseph Hooker launched an assault, overrunning Confederate positions on Lookout Mountain on November 24th, just in time to assist Grant’s advance on Bragg’s position at Missionary Ridge. The result was a resounding victory for the Union, crushing the Confederates' hopes that emerged from their victory at Chickamauga. Chattanooga became the supply center for General William T. Sherman’s Atlanta Campaign.</abstract>
