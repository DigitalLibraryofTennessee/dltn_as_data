   <abstract>John Livingstone Hadley died on December 26,1870. His real property was divided between his sons John L. and Robert L. Hadley. Plaintiffs are heirs of defendant Robert L. while the defendants are heirs of son John L. In his will, testator didnâ€™t survey the land because he hoped his heirs would partition it themselves. The government took 4 acres of land and paid $400. Plaintiffs argue to divide land according to the will and split the money. From John L. Hadley et al v. Livingstone Hadley et al.</abstract>
