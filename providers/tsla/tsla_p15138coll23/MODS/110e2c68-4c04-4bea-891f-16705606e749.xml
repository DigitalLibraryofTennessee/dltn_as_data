   <abstract>Field notes and hand-drawn pencil maps of Francis Mohrhardt, a Union major and topographical engineer in Gen. William Rosecrans' Army of the Cumberland, attached to the staff of Gen. Philip Sheridan, include numerous pencil-drawn maps of this army's 1863 summer campaign from Murfreesboro to Chattanooga, Tenn., otherwise known as the Tullahoma Campaign. A large series of 30+ maps, which show in detail the road taken by the army from its encampment near Murfreesboro to its crossing of the Tennessee River near Bridgeport, Alabama and its eventual arrival in Chattanooga. Different plates depict the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad line, bridges and ferries, forts and breastworks, homes and structures along the road, Tullahoma, the University at Sewanee, Cowan Station, distances between towns, and topographical features. Notes and the maps are presented in original order, which in general are reverse order from Alabama northward.</abstract>
