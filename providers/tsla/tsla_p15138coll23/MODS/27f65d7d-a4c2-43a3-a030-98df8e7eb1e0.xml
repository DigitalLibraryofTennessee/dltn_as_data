   <abstract>Hand-drawn map showing the reroute of White's Creek Turnpike across the Cumberland River from Nashville in 1845. Various pond and drainage features are shown in what would later become Edgefield. The corporation limits of the City of Nashville are shown along with the Lick Branch that flowed through the old French Lick. The old White's Creek road ran along the river in what this map refers to as the river bottom. The turnpike was built upon high ground as shown on this map. The Cumberland River, Lick Branch, the Gallatin Turnpike, Dickinson meeting house road, and Nashville Bridge are depicted, as are a cabin, icehouse and well on a tract labeled Washington's Lands. The new turnpike separates the lands of James McGavock, Col. Robert Weakley, and James Crutcher. It runs through John Shelby and Thomas Washington's lands, which are shown in great detail including his cabin, well, and ice house. The proposed turnpike is located near present-day Dickerson Pike and Trinity Road. The map was drawn by White's Creek Turnpike Superintendent and later owner, C. W. Nance.</abstract>
   <abstract>White's Creek Turnpike was given a charter of incorporation in 1830, and C. W. Nance was appointed to superintend the construction, totaling $31,000. The turnpike was finished in 1844.</abstract>
