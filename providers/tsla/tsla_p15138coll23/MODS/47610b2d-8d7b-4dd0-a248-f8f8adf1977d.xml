   <abstract>Includes the area of south-central Tennessee below the Military Reservation from the Tennessee River on the west through present-day Perry, Hickman, and Maury counties to Columbia. Because these surveyor district maps were produced by official state surveyors to facilitate the location of public land entries and grants, they are divided into equidistant townships and sections. They also show named streams, roads, and some towns as well as, in this case, the southern boundary of the North Carolina military reservation for Revolutionary War grantees.</abstract>
   <abstract>The twelve district surveyors maps were produced as Indian treaties and land cessions opened up new territory for state land sales--the location of which "grants" was their chief purpose.</abstract>
