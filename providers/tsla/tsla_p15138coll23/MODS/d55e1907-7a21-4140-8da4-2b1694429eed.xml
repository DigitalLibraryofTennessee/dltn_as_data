   <abstract>A pair of surveys and plats executed by Davidson County surveyor, John Joslin, depicting a tract of land in Davidson County owned by Judge John Haywood. The home is drawn in the middle of the tract flanked by two large fields. A large thicket is seen just south of the house. One of the plats notes that corn is grown in the south east field and divides up the land immediately adjacent to the house into garden, lot, yard, and dwelling. Some neighbors are indicated.</abstract>
   <abstract>Susan Cannon Glasgow Haywood married Thomas Jefferson Haywood, son of Judge John Haywood. John Haywood purchased the land from James Lynch. He apparently paid for the land with credit and at the time of his death still owed on it. The land went up for auction and defendant Ensley bought it, supposedly with the understanding that nobody would bid against him because he was purchasing the land for the benefit of plaintiffs. Ensley claimed to have won over two other bidders. The chancellor ultimately sided with Ensley and ruled that Haywood must repay the purchase amount if he were to take possession of the land. This land appears to be a second tract Haywood owned in the 7th civil district of Davidson County and not his primary residence at Tusculum.</abstract>
