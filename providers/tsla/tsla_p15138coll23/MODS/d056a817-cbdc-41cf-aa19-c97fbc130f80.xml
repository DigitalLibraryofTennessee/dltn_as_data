   <abstract>Survey of James Park's estate near Knoxville containing about 470 acres. This area presently makes up the Sequoyah Hills neighborhood. Looney's Island is drawn in the Holston River, as is Peter Varner's home, and the county road [Kingston Pike].</abstract>
   <abstract>James Park was born in 1770 and died in 1853. This map was most likely drawn as an exhibit to settle his estate. He purchased this land from Christian Rhodes in 1804, who had purchased it from Moses Looney 6 years prior. Looney Island was named for Moses, the original owner of the Park tract and one of the earliest settlers of Knox County. His family still maintained ownership over an adjacent tract at the time of this survey.</abstract>
