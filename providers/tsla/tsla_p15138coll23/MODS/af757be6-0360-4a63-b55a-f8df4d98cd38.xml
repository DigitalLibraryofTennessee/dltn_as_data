   <abstract>Highway map of Tennessee predating the interstate system. The legend denotes paved roads, good stone or gravel roads, poor stone or gravel roads, dirt roads, unimproved roads, roads under construction, emergency first aid stations, and toll bridges. Includes indexes, highway mileage log, illustrations of traffic signs and 6 ancillary maps: Memphis, Nashville, Knoxville, Jackson, Chattanooga and Johnson City. The reverse side has a listing of highway numbers and junctions.</abstract>
   <abstract>The Tennessee State Highway Department was created in 1915 to oversee both publicly and privately funded highways. The earliest highway maps were created by physically driving roads and using specialized instruments to measure distance, gradient, altitude, and mapping each particular road. They often consulted the United States Geological Survey maps and worked in tandem with them to keep one another's maps current, often using transparent sheets to make corrections or additions. The State Highway Department was renamed the Tennessee Department of Transportation in 1972.</abstract>
