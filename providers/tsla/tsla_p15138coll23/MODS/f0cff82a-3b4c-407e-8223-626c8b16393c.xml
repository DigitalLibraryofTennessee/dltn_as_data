   <abstract>Map showing range and section lines, counties, streams, some roads, and county seats of Tennessee's First Surveyors District--basically the old North Carolina Military Reservation of middle Tennessee. The Tennessee River appears at the western edge of the map. The counties of Montgomery, Robertson, Sumner, Dickson, Davidson, Williamson, Rutherford, Wilson, Smith, Jackson, and White are labeled. The country seats that are designated are Clarksville, Springfield, Gallatin, Charlotte, Nashville, Franklin, Jefferson, Lebanon, Carthage, and Williamsburg. Because these surveyor district maps were produced by official state surveyors to facilitate the location of public land entries and grants, they are divided into equidistant townships and sections. This especially large map has been divided into six images.</abstract>
   <abstract>The twelve district surveyors maps were produced as Indian treaties and land cessions opened up new territory for state land sales--the location of which "grants" was their chief purpose.</abstract>
