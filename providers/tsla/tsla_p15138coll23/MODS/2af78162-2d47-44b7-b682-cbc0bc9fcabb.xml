   <abstract>This plat is one of many surveyed by Henry Rutherford, son of North Carolina Gen. Griffith Rutherford, on his 1785 expedition through what was then Chickasaw territory west of the Tennessee River to lay off tracts for the Blounts and other well-connected Eastern clients. Far in advance of any prospective settlement--the land would not come open by treaty for settlement until around 1820, this particular tract was on the Reelfoot River in northwest Tennessee, near what became Reelfoot Lake after the 1811-1812 New Madrid earthquakes. Alexander Moore and Amos Moore served as chain carriers.</abstract>
   <abstract>John Gray and Thomas Blount were two of the most prolific land speculators in early Tennessee. They, along with their older brother William Blount, were incredibly influential during the formative period in Tennessee history and the early public land system of North Carolina, the Southwest Territory and Tennessee. Thomas served in the Revolutionary War, as a lieutenant and later as a militia Major General. John Gray served in the North Carolina House of Commons and Senate from 1782-1795. They both were elected as trustees of the University of North Carolina.</abstract>
