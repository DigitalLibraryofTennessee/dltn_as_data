   <abstract>Hand-drawn map of Marion County showing civil districts, rivers, lakes, and roads. The town of Jasper is shown as is part of the Tennessee River and Sequachee [Sequatchie] River. Some landowners are indicated. Surveyor's calls for each civil district's boundaries are provided. Residents whose dwellings were precinct polling places are named for each of the new civil districts, per requirements of the new 1834 Tennessee constitution which prompted the creation of this series of county maps.</abstract>
   <abstract>These 1836 county maps showing the new civil districts, required by the new state constitution, written in 1834 and ratified the following year, which mandated such civil divisions for taxation and election purposes, were done for many counties. Marion County was created in 1817, from lands purchased from the Cherokee. It is named for Revolutionary War hero, Francis Marion. Its county seat and largest town is Jasper, named for William Jasper, hero of Fort Moultrie in the Revolutionary War.</abstract>
