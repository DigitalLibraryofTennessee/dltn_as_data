   <abstract>Hand-colored map of Jeddo (Edo), or Tokyo, Japan showing the Shogunate precinct and gardens, government offices, houses and grounds, temples, shrines, bays, rivers, markets, canals, roads, bridges, and fields of rice and vegetables. Map notations and a key in lower right corner are written in Japanese. The Imperial Palace is in the center and the Bay of Jeddo lies east of the city. The Dutch trading concession, where Westerners were allowed to trade, is also depicted. Also attached is the envelope in which the map was originally stored. It has an inscription in English as well as a color coded key and a legend on the reverse.</abstract>
   <abstract>This map was an early gift to the Tennessee Historical Society and came with the following inscription: ""This map is all the work of native artists, and was printed and colored in the City of Jeddo, Japan for the Rev. Henry Wood, Chaplain of the steam frigate Powhatan."" Rev. Wood evidently served as chaplain with Commodore Matthew Perry's second fleet that sailed into Tokyo Bay in 1854 to force the opening of Tokugawa Shogunate Japan to Western, i.e. American, commerce. He presumably obtained this map from a Japanese vendor or mapmaker in the city.</abstract>
