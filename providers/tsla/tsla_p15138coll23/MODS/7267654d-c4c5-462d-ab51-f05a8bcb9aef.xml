   <abstract>Mounted on cardboard, this map shows troop movement and placement during the three days of battle. Other topographical features include Rock Creek, ridges, and tree cover. There are also roads and an "unfinished" railroad, or the Gettysburg Railroad. Locations important to the battle include Round Top, oak ridge, Seminary Ridge, Culp's Hill, Cemetery Ridge, and the Peach Orchard.</abstract>
   <abstract>The Battle of Gettysburg, often regarded as the turning point of the Civil War, was fought July 1 to July 3, 1863. Buoyed by his success at Chancellorsville, Lee hoped to shift the mood of northern politicians and citizens alike with an invasion into Pennsylvania. Lee's Army of Northern VIrginia met Meade's Army of the Potomac near the town of Gettysburg. The battle resulted in the greatest number of casualties of the Civil War, some 23,000 on each side. This would mark the furthest north the Confederate army would reach during the war.</abstract>
