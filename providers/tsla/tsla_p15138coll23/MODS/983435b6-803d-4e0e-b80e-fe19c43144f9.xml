   <abstract>This 19th century map shows the east-to-west elevations of Tennessee and a color-coded legend of different geological strata. Geological maps have many uses including determining areas suitable for agriculture, identifying potential geological hazards and locating groundwater and mineral deposits. This diagram was made to accompany Dr. Gerard Troost's Geological map of Tennessee, Map 513 in our collection.</abstract>
   <abstract>Peter S. Duval was born in France and trained as a lithographer in Paris. Fellow lithographer Cephas G. Childs met and hired Duval and brought him back to Philadelphia to work in his company. When Childs retired from the lithography business in 1834, he sold his interest in the firm to Duval and George Lehman. The company of Lehman &amp; Duval moved the business to a building at Dock Street and Bank Alley in 1835. Lehman resigned in 1837, and the firm became known as P. S. Duval's Lithographic Establishment.</abstract>
