   <abstract>Hand-drawn map showing the area around Knoxville, indicating Fort Sanders and other Union fortifications and regiments at the time of the Confederate assault on the city in November 1863. The map was created by Union soldier Seth Alden Abbey (1798-1880) and was included in a diary that he kept. The map shows the disposition of forces, barracks, hilltop gun emplacements, Confederate lines and "Rebel ferry" involved in the Battle of Knoxville.</abstract>
   <abstract>Seth Abbey came to Cleveland in 1830 with his widowed father, Peter Abbey, from Enfield, Connecticut. Seth Abbey assisted in the incorporation of the city in 1836 by serving, along with Edmund Clark and Richard Winslow, as judge of elections. He was also city marshal for a time, as well as judge of police court. When the Civil War broke out, he enlisted and served in the Ohio Volunteer Cavalry.</abstract>
