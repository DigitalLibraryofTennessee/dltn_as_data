   <abstract>Plate 6 of southeastern Nashville from Hopkins' 1889 Atlas of Nashville. The shape and material of each structure, as well as property lines can be ascertained from the map. Central Tennessee College, Meharry Medical College, Trimble School, and an unnamed public school are all denoted. Various subdivisions and additions to the city are indicated. The structures colored pink are made of brick while the ones shaded yellow are wood framed.</abstract>
   <abstract>Griffith Morgan Hopkins was born around 1836, however the exact date is unknown. He first began printing maps in 1857 and continued until his retirement in 1900. He founded G. M. Hopkins &amp; Co. with his brother Henry W. Hopkins, and together they produced many city and county atlases, primarily of the northeast, from their shop in Philadelphia. Their 1908 Atlas of Nashville is a fine, block-by-block depiction of the town in a period of growth to a modern urban center. G. M. Hopkins &amp; Co. continued on after the founders' retirements until the Great Depression ended the demand for their atlases. The company was sold to the Franklin Survey Company in 1943, with the name intact, due to its association with quality.</abstract>
