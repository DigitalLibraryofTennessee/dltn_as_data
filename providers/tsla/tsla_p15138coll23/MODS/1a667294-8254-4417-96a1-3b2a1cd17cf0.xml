   <abstract>Detailed view of the neighborhoods north of the capitol, including parts of Hellâ€™s Half Acre, Smokey Row, and Germantown. The old street names are visible as are the various additions to the city of Nashville. The Lick Branch was still above ground and runs through the area depicted in this plate. A Louisville and Nashville (L&amp;N) Railyard is located in the bottom right of the plate, next door to the Linck's Hotel. Various school buildings, churches, and businesses populate the lots and some landowners are named. The blocks along the river were industrial, containing saw mills, ice factories, stock yards, a gas works, tannery, and other large manufactories and businesses. The city owns some of the land toward the center. An early grandstand is seen at Sulphur Dell, but is unnamed until the 1908 version of Hopkins Atlas. A legend is located in the bottom right.</abstract>
   <abstract>Griffith Morgan Hopkins was born around 1836, however the exact date is unknown. He first began printing maps in 1857 and continued until his retirement in 1900. He founded G. M. Hopkins &amp; Co. with his brother Henry W. Hopkins, and together they produced many city and county atlases, primarily of the northeast, from their shop in Philadelphia. Their 1908 Atlas of Nashville is a fine, block-by-block depiction of the town in a period of growth to a modern urban center. G. M. Hopkins &amp; Co. continued on after the founders' retirements until the Great Depression ended the demand for their atlases. The company was sold to the Franklin Survey Company in 1943, with the name intact, due to its association with quality.</abstract>
