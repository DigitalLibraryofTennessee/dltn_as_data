   <abstract>Hand-drawn and colored map of Lincoln County (Tenn.) showing Fayetteville, Petersburg, Concord, Buckeye, Lynchburg, Boon's Hill, Pleasant Hill, part of the Elk River, the Cumberland Mountains, roads, and creeks. There are also two factories denoted, Elk Factory and Warren's Factory, both cotton or textile factories. Lincoln County was a large cotton-producing county before the Civil War. Cane Creek post office and Robinson's Sulphur Wells &amp; Mineral Springs are also indicated.</abstract>
   <abstract>This map, along with his other county maps, may have been used by Rhea to make his seminal map of the State of Tennessee with cousin Joseph Campbell Rhea. Lincoln County was formed in 1809 from part of Bedford County. The land occupied by the county was part of a land cession obtained from the Cherokee and Chickasaw in 1806. The county is named for Revolutionary War general, Benjamin Lincoln. Its county seat and largest city is Fayetteville, named for the Marquis de Lafayette, and most likely Fayetteville, North Carolina..</abstract>
