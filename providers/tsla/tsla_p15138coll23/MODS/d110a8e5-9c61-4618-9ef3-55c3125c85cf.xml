   <abstract>Hand-drawn map of the area southeast of antebellum Nashville between Stones River Pike and Murfreesboro Road, showing residences, buildings, and property owners. Franklin College, the Tennessee Asylum for the Insane, the Harris Race Track (an early horse racing venue), Edmonson Place, Temple Harris Place, Mrs. [Tolbert] Fanning's, and the town of Glencliff appear on the map. Each parcel is divided showing the property lines. The Nashville International Airport occupies this location presently.</abstract>
   <abstract>This map depicts approximately 1849-1863 as both Franklin College and the Tennessee Asylum for the Insane appear on it. Franklin College was established in 1845 by Rev. Tolbert Fanning and included alumni such as Francis McMillan Carmack, David Lipscomb, and James Scobey. The college burned to the ground in 1866. The Tennessee Asylum for the Insane was built in 1840 and burned down in 1863. The Stones River Turnpike was established in 1849, by and act of the legislature. A telling detail is that Fanning's residence is labeled as Mrs. Fanning's which seems to indicate it was drawn after Tolbert's death in 1874. Therefore this map most likely depicts this area after 1874. It also appears to be on tracing cloth which wasn't popularized until the 1850s, but it could be a later tracing of an earlier map.</abstract>
