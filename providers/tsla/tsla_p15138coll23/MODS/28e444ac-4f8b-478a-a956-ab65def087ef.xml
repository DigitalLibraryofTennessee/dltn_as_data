   <abstract>This hand-drawn map of Sullivan County was drawn to accompany 1865 House Bill 167, legislation to move the county seat from Blountville to Bristol. Bristol, Blountville, Kingsport, Union, and Paperville are all denoted. Magistrates districts, roads, Carter's depot, Gasley's mill, Massengill's, and the East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad are included. The districts shown may be magistrates' districts as they have names in addition to numbers. Geological features include, Bays Mountain, Chimney Mountain, the Iron Mountains, and the Holston and Watauga rivers and their tributaries.</abstract>
   <abstract>Sullivan County was established in 1779 when it was still a part of North Carolina. It is Tennessee's second oldest county, with the oldest being Washington. It is named for Revolutionary War general John Sullivan and was part of the State of Franklin during its existence from 1784-1788. Its largest city is Kingsport and the county seat is Blountville.</abstract>
