   <abstract>Hand-drawn map of Cocke County that outlines the newly established civil districts. Part of the Pigeon River and the French Broad River are shown along with roads and the towns of Newport and Parrotsville. Various roads are named and a feature near the meeting of the Big Pigeon and French Broad rivers called Irish Bottom. Included are the descriptive surveyors notes of metes and bounds of the civil districts with many specific place-names.</abstract>
   <abstract>These 1836 county maps showing the new civil districts, required by the new state constitution, written in 1834 and ratified the following year, which mandated such civil divisions for taxation and election purposes, were done for many counties. Cocke County was established in 1797 from a part of Jefferson County. It is named after William Cocke, one of the first United States Senators. Its largest city and county seat is Newport. During the Civil War, Cocke County was pro-Union and actually voted against Tennessee's secession.</abstract>
