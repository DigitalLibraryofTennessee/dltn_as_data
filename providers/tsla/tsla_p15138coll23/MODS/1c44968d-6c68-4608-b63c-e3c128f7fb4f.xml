   <abstract>Two hand-drawn maps of Maury County. The first depicts the updated county boundaries of Maury County but includes the original Lewis County line and a fraction of Marshall County. The towns of Columbia, Spring Hill, Mt. Pleasant, Hampshire, Williamsport, Bigbyville, and Benton are drawn. The Central Turnpike and Pulaski Turnpike are indicated. Geographic features include the Duck River and its many tributaries. The Congressional Reservation line is denoted. The second map includes many of the same features, but adds more surveying notes, bridges, and a township and range grid in western Maury County. It was drawn to accompany James W. Matthews' deposition.</abstract>
   <abstract>Maury County sued neighboring Lewis County for their failure to adhere to an act passed by the General Assembly on December 21, 1843, that stated fractions be taken from Maury, Hickman, Lawrence, and Wayne counties to create Lewis County. The county officials wanted another survey because the original took too much land from Maury County. See Map 2543</abstract>
