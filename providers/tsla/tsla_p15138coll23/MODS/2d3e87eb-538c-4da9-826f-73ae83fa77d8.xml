   <abstract>The Battle of Dover, also known as the Second Battle of Fort Donelson, took place February 3, 1863. Major General Joseph Wheeler led two cavalry brigades, one commanded by Nathan Bedford Forrest, to attack the 800-man garrison at Dover. The garrison, led by Colonel Abner C. Harding, was heavily entrenched and was able to hold off the Confederate assault until dusk. The following day Wheeler retreated, drawing the ire of Forrest, who vowed never again to serve under his command.</abstract>
