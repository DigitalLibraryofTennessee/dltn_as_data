   <abstract>Hand-drawn map of Weakley County outlining the newly established civil districts as well as the township and range grid. Dresden is the large town centered on the map. Creeks and forks of the Obion River are named. The Huntingdon Road, Trenton Road, Paris Road, Mayfield Road, Meridian Road, Troy Road, Waidsburough [Wadesboro] Road, and the road to Mills Point (present-day Hickman, Kentucky) are all denoted. Surveyor's calls for each civil district's boundaries are provided.</abstract>
   <abstract>These 1836 county maps showing the new civil districts, required by the new state constitution, written in 1834 and ratified the following year, which mandated such civil divisions for taxation purposes, were done for many counties. Weakley County was formed in 1823 from parts of Henry and Carroll counties. It is named for State Senator, Chickasaw commissioner, and U.S. Representative Robert Weakley. Its county seat is Dresden, named after Dresden, Germany, while its largest city is Martin, named for Captain William Martin, a successful planter and landowner in the region.</abstract>
