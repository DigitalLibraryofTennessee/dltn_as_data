   <abstract>Undated hand-drawn map of Scott County, Tennessee, on cloth, using colored inks and pencil. Property owners and rivers and creeks are shown in brown ink. Railroads and related notations are in purple ink. Land entry notations and dates are in pencil. Unidentified blocked-out areas are in blue ink. A mostly legible key is at the top right. This map may have been created for railroad planning and construction. The railroad, the Cincinnati and Southern Railway, was not completed through Scott County until 1879.</abstract>
   <abstract>Scott County was established in 1849 from parts of Anderson, Campbell, Fentress and Morgan counties. It was named for Mexican War hero General Winfield Scott. Its county seat is Huntsville, while its largest city is Oneida. Scott County was the most strongly opposed county to Tennessee's secession in 1861. It went as far as seceding from Tennessee, and thus the Confederacy, to form the "State of Scott," a resolution that was not repealed until 1986.</abstract>
