   <abstract>By the 1840s, thousands of American Indians had been forced from their homelands and pushed West to Indian Territory in present-day Oklahoma. In the late 1880s, after these displaced civilizations were finally prospering in their new home, the United States government halved Indian Territory, opening the remainder for white settlers. Once Oklahoma became a state in 1907, the remaining American Indians lost their sovereignty. Many served in World War II, notably the Navajo Code Talkers, but returned to more hardship implemented by the federal government. Federal agents would remove native children from their families to raise them under the state's protection, eliminating familial and cultural ties. It wasn't until the 1970s that American Indians began to exert political influence nationally.</abstract>
