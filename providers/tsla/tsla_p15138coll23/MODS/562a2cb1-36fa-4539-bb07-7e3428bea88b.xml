   <abstract>Plate 7 from Hopkins 1889 Atlas of Nashville. The plate depicts the area around St. Cloud Hill and the City Cemetery. Both the Louisville and Nashville (L&amp;N), and Nashville, Chattanooga, and St. Louis (N,C&amp;St.L) Railroads run through the neighborhood. The Roman Catholic Cemetery is named, as are a pair of churches, mills, and a number of landowners. Unfortunately, no details are included of Ft. Negley. Many African Americans impressed from the construction of Ft. Negley settled nearby, forming a precursor to the present Edgehill neighborhood. The corporation line is denoted in green. Map legend located in top right.</abstract>
   <abstract>Griffith Morgan Hopkins was born around 1836, however the exact date is unknown. He first began printing maps in 1857 and continued until his retirement in 1900. He founded G. M. Hopkins &amp; Co. with his brother Henry W. Hopkins, and together they produced many city and county atlases, primarily of the northeast, from their shop in Philadelphia. Their 1908 Atlas of Nashville is a fine, block-by-block depiction of the town in a period of growth to a modern urban center. G. M. Hopkins &amp; Co. continued on after the founders' retirements until the Great Depression ended the demand for their atlases. The company was sold to the Franklin Survey Company in 1943, with the name intact, due to its association with quality.</abstract>
