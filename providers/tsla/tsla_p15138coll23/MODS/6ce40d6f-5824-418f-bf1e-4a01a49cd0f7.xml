   <abstract>Hand-drawn map, possibly by Matthew Rhea, of Knox County (Tenn.) showing Knoxville, Clinton, Maryville, Sevierville, Gravesville, Loveville (Lovell), and Louisville. The Holston (Tennessee) and Clinch rivers and tributaries are depicted and labeled. Other geographic features such as Chestnut Ridge, Black Oak Ridge, Bull Run, and Copper Ridge are shown. These features are important for understanding early Knox County surveys, as they are some of the landmarks used. McBee's Ferry, Campbell's Station, and Meredith's are denoted. The Ramsey House, also known as Mecklenburg, is shown on the map, however it is written as McLinburg. Survey notes are listed on reverse.</abstract>
   <abstract>This map, along with his other county maps, may have been used by Matthew Rhea in preparing his seminal 1834 map of the State of Tennessee with cousin Joseph Campbell Rhea. An important geographical feature of Knox County is the origin of the Tennessee River at the union of the Holston and French Broad rivers.</abstract>
