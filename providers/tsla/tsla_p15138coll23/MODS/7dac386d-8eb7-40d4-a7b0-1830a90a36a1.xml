   <abstract>An illustrated ""aerial"" map of Harriman, Tenn. in 1892 showing commercial buildings, churches, houses, and manufactories. Harriman was created by postbellum Northern investors as a model industrial town based on coal, iron, timber and the ideals of prohibition. The offices of the East Tennessee Land Company, one of many local businesses depicted as inset views, later became the Temperance Hall. Streets are named and there is a numbered key at the bottom that provides names of businesses, churches, schools and public buildings. Similar to Map 467.</abstract>
   <abstract>In the years after the Civil War, Thaddeus M. Fowler was the most prolific of a small group of itinerant viewmakers who traveled the country to capture its boom towns, villages, and cities in such lithographed ""bird's eye"" prints, making a living selling these print maps to proud citizens who'd pre-ordered. Walter C. Harriman, for whom the town was named, was a Union soldier whose father campaigned with Burnside in East Tennessee. He became a managing director of the East Tennessee Land Company, owner of several industrial establishments, and built a large house in town. This map was used as an exhibit in a Tennessee Supreme Court case of Knoxville Iron Company v. W. B. Crinkley, 1909. In the case, Knoxville Iron Company requested an injunction against W. B. Crinkley to stop him from pulling up railroad tracks that cut across his property.</abstract>
