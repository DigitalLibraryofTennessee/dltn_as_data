   <abstract>A Nashville street map, hand-drawn in ink and pencil on architectural fabric. Depicts the Nashville &amp; Chattanooga Railroad line where it crossed under Broad Street and McGavock Street; the tunnel above which is labeled Lawrence Street. Also depicted is Demumbrane (Demonbreun) Street, Vauxhall Street, Gowdey Street, and Granny White Pike. The homes and structures indicated on the map are the Oil Works, Snyder’s House, Prichett’s House, Mrs. Pyles, a Negro Cabin, a Brickhouse, and Fanny Thompson’s house.

   <abstract>This map was used as evidence in a Tennessee Supreme Court case brought against the Nashville &amp; Chattanooga R.R. by the widow of Wiley D. Snyder. Snyder was mortally injured when he either fell or was thrown into a deep railroad cut near Demonbreun Street and Granny White Pike. The plaintiff in the case alleged the defendant was legally responsible for Snyder’s injuries and subsequent death due to the danger posed by the open railroad cut. The defense alleged that Snyder’s accident was due to his own negligence or may have been precipitated by a physical assault on Snyder by a person or persons unknown. Judgment rendered in favor of the defendant.</abstract>
