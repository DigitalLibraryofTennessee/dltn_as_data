   <abstract>Hand-drawn map of Sullivan County (Tenn.) outlining the newly established civil districts. Surveyor's calls for each civil district's boundaries are provided. Blountville, Paperville, stage roads, Ready Creek road, Bays Mountain, Iron Mountains, and the Holston and Watauga rivers and their tributaries are all drawn.</abstract>
   <abstract>These 1836 county maps showing the new civil districts, required by the new state constitution, written in 1834 and ratified the following year, which mandated such civil divisions for taxation purposes, were done for many counties. Sullivan County was established in 1779 when it was still a part of North Carolina. It is Tennessee's second oldest county, with the oldest being Washington. It is named for Revolutionary War general John Sullivan and was part of the State of Franklin during its existence from 1784-1788. Its largest city is Kingsport and the county seat is Blountville.</abstract>
