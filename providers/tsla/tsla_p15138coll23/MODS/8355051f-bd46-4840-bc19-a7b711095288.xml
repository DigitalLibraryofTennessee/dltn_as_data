   <abstract>Hand-drawn map, approximately 1850, on cotton cloth depicting the area near Nashville City Cemetery and adjoining "Catholic Cemetery." It shows property plats along the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad with street names, the "Nashville Cemetery,""Catholic Cemetery," house structures, and what appears to be the right-of-way for a major thoroughfare, possibly the soon-to-be-built Tennessee &amp; Alabama (later Nashville &amp; Decatur) Railroad.</abstract>
   <abstract>Cotton cloth was occasionally used in lieu of paper due to its sturdiness and portability. This map was drawn prior to 1852, when the Tennessee and Alabama Railroad was constructed through the area depicted. Conversely, it could not have been made prior to 1822, the year the Nashville City Cemetery opened. The Catholic cemetery was moved to Calvary Cemetery in 1868. Fort Negley Park and Herschel Greer Stadium presently stand in the location shown.</abstract>
