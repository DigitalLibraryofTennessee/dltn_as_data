   <abstract>Hand-drawn map of Montgomery County. Part of the map is partially faded, a tactic Matthew Rhea typically employed to show peripheral details, however has drawn in key points on this particular rendering. Clarksville, Palmyra, and Port Royal are boldly drawn as are the Red River, the eastern half of the Cumberland River, and a handful of creeks. Faded data includes the towns of New York and Bryan [Bryans on the published version], an iron works [listed as a furnace on the published version, and an unnamed circled listed as Lafayette Furnace on the published version. Roads are denoted by dotted lines. The borders with Dickson County, Robertson County, and Kentucky are shown.</abstract>
   <abstract>This map, along with his other county maps, may have been used by Rhea to make his seminal map of the State of Tennessee with cousin Joseph Campbell Rhea.</abstract>
