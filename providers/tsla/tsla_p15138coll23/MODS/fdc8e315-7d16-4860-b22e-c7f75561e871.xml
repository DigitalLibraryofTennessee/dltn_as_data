   <abstract>This hand-traced and colored map shows the boundary between North Carolina and Tennessee, surveyed by William Davenport and Robert Armstrong for NC and TN, respectively, in 1821. Its main purpose is to show the surveyor's detail of the TN-NC boundary from Tennessee's southeastern corner to the point in Cocke County near Wildcat Top where the Pigeon River (and today's Interstate-40) cross into North Carolina. The map was traced on Imperial Tracing Cloth to be an exact copy of the 1821 original. Apparently used as an exhibit in a 1921 court case Southern Spruce Co. v. Little River Lumber Co., et al. and Southern Spruce Co. v. Alex H. Sands et al." the copy mirrors exactly the style of the original and shows such features as the historic Unicoy [Unicoi] Turnpike Road, the Great Iron or Smoky Mountain, various "paths" to Cherokee towns, and the communities of Sevierville and Tellico Plains.</abstract>
   <abstract>To preserve its longevity, this tracing was created from the original and was used in a 1912 Tennessee Supreme Court case. The State Librarian and Archivist, Robert T. Quarles, wanted to preserve the original at the archives in Nashville but has since been lost, loaned, or misplaced. It is possible the original map was sequestered by the United States Supreme Court for State of North Carolina v. State of Tennessee, just as the field notes of the North Carolina surveyor, William Davenport, were in 1914.</abstract>
