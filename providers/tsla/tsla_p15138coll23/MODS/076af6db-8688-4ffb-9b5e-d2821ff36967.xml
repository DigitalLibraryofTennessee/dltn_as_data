   <abstract>Hand-drawn map of Fayette County showing the newly established civil districts. Parts of the Loosahatchie River and Wolf River are shown along with roads (including the main Nashville-Memphis stage road through Somerville) and range &amp; section lines. Included are the descriptive surveyors notes giving the metes and bounds for each civil district. Residences used as polling places or election precincts are faintly visible.</abstract>
   <abstract>These 1836 county maps showing the new civil districts, required by the new state constitution, written in 1834 and ratified the following year, which mandated such civil divisions for taxation and election purposes, were done for many counties. Fayette County was established in 1824 and was named after the Marquis de la Fayette, a French hero from the American Revolution. Its largest city is Oakland and its county seat is Somerville.</abstract>
