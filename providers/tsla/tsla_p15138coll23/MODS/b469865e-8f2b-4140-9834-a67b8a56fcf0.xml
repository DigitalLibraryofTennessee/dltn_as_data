   <abstract>Hand-drawn map by Confederate cavalryman John Johnston of actions south of the city during the Dec. 15-16, 1864 Battle of Nashville (mostly first day). It shows the positions of Rucker's Brigade (part of Forrest's cavalry to which Johnston was attached), Union picket lines, Confederate Gen. Hood's line, General Hatch's Union Cavalry, and the lines of probable Confederate retreat. The map also shows the Cumberland River and Charlotte, Harding, Hillsboro, Granny White, Franklin, and Murfreesboro Pikes.</abstract>
   <abstract>John Johnston was born in 1842 and joined the Confederate army in April 1861. He served in Nathan Bedford Forrest's cavalry during the war. Following the war he became a lawyer in Memphis and wrote a memoir of his experiences during the Civil War, for which these maps were drawn. He died in 1928.</abstract>
