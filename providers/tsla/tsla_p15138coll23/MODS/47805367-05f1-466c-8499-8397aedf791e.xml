   <abstract>A map created by the Tennessee Emergency Relief Administration (TERA) in January, 1935 showing the electric grid of Henderson County (Tenn." Electricity-related details include substations as well as specifying between distribution, transmission, and transmission and distribution lines. The map indicates the location of structures in the county with symbols marking each residence, church, school, filling station, store, industry, tourist camp, garage, and airport. Geographic features such as creeks and rivers are also shown.</abstract>
   <abstract>TERA was formed on April 1, 1934, as an ancillary to the Federal Emergency Relief Administration. TERA projects were spread across the state and were responsible for hundreds of public works projects as well as supplying direct aid to urban and rural communities in Tennessee. It served as the precursor to the Rural Electrification Administration which, in tandem with the Tennessee Valley Authority, provided electricity and electrical infrastructure to rural communities across the state.</abstract>
