   <abstract>Geological map of southeastern Tennessee, and northern Georgia and Alabama. The map details wagon roads, railroads, state and county boundaries, county seats, factories, mills, churches, and post office towns. Symbols depict furnaces, forges, rolling mills, copper furnaces, and watering places. Color-coded mineralogical designations are in the legend, however these were never shaded in on the map. A small street view inset of Chattanooga appears in the top left along with an engraving of the Stanton House. The map is bordered in a Greek-style design.</abstract>
   <abstract>This map is an artifact of Tennessee's effort to promote the rich mineral resources available for potential manufacturers after the Civil War. At the time, northern investors were purchasing huge acreages in mineral rich areas of Appalachia. Tennessee was an early leader in iron and--to a lesser extent--steel production as well as coal mining. However, by the beginning of the 20th century, the focus of steel-making shifted southward to Birmingham, Alabama.</abstract>
