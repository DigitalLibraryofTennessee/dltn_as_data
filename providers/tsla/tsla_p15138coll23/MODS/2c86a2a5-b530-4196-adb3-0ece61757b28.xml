   <abstract>Survey and plat of 640 acres of land in Williamson County, Tennessee owned and surveyed by Thomas Molloy. The land was originally assigned (sold) to Andrew Haddock, heir of Henry Hicks, by the State of North Carolina. 640 acres was the share granted by North Carolina to privates who had served in the Continental Army. Property is adjacent to land owned by James Robertson, which he purchased from Revolutionary War officer Capt. Peter B[e]cote. Molloy was, along with Robertson, among the earliest surveyors in Middle Tennessee; both were heavily involved in speculation in North Carolina military lands, of which this is an example. William McGah and John Hutton served as deputy surveyor Molloy's chain carriers.</abstract>
   <abstract>Thomas Molloy was one of the earliest surveyors and settlers of Davidson County. Molloy's hand drawn plats are particularly fine examples of the early surveyors art in Tennessee. He was elected to the Inferior Court of Pleas for Davidson County in 1783 and was a prominent landowner in the area.</abstract>
