   <abstract>This map was "donated to the Tennessee Historical Society by the Hon. John Bell in 1859." John Bell was born in Nashville in 1796. In 1814, he graduated from Cumberland College and studied law until his admittance to the bar in 1816. He served in the State Senate, U. S. House of Representatives, and U. S. Senate. During Bell's tenure in the U. S. House, he drafted the the Indian Removal Act. However, the Bank Wars caused a rift between Bell and his old friend Andrew Jackson. He was elected Speaker of the U. S. House of Representatives as an anti-Jacksonian in 1834. In 1841, William Henry Harrison selected Bell as his Secretary of War, rewarding him for his support of Harrison's presidential campaign. Following his tenure in the Senate, Bell ran for president under the Constitutional Union party, narrowly defeating Samuel Houston for the party's nomination. He received nearly 600,000 popular votes and 39 electoral votes, from Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee. Initially supporting the Union, Bell defected to the Confederacy following the Union's invasion of Tennessee. He died at his home near Dover, Tennessee, in 1869.</abstract>
