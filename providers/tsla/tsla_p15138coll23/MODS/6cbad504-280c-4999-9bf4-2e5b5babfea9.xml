   <abstract>This extremely detailed blueline map of Sevier County, Tennessee shows every house structure, church, school, store, and community center, as well as the rural delivery routes of the postal service. Many landowners are named along with streams, springs, timber camps, and small communities. Very interesting depiction of Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge, and the terrain of Sevier County before the creation of Smoky Mountains National Park, including families and communities that were removed when the park was established.</abstract>
   <abstract>Formed in 1794 from a portion of adjacent Jefferson County, Sevier County was one of the 14 original counties of Tennessee. It is named for Revolutionary War veteran and governor of the failed State of Franklin John Sevier, who later served as governor of Tennessee. Its county seat and largest city is Sevierville. Historically its economy was based on subsistence agriculture, but after the creation of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, tourism became the most important industry.</abstract>
