   <abstract>The Battle of Fort Donelson began on February 12, 1862, just days after the surrender of nearby Fort Henry. Union forces under Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant surrounded the fort's defenses, commanded by Brigadier General John B. Floyd. Confederate troops under Brigadier General Gideon J. Pillow attempted to push back the right flank to create an escape route to Nashville, but were repulsed by a counterattack commanded by Brigadier General Lew Wallace. After the unsuccessful push, Floyd and Pillow fled, passing command to Brigadier General Simon Bolivar Buckner. Colonel Nathan Bedford Forrest refused to surrender and escaped to Nashville with his cavalry overnight. Buckner surrendered the fort and over 12,000 troops to Grant the following day, February 16. Fort Donelson was the last major obstacle on the way to Nashville and opened up Middle Tennessee to Union control. The battle led to Grant's promotion to Major General, while Floyd was relieved of his command and Pillow was suspended for two months.</abstract>
