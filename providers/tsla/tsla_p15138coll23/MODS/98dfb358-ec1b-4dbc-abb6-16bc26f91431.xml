   <abstract>Plat map of the Riverside subdivision adjacent to the Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State Normal School. Hand-drawn notes indicate ownership information of some of the lots, however it is unknown who drew them. On school lands are images of three original school buildings now demolished: the male dormitory, the female dormitory, and the main building. A bird's-eye view of the undeveloped property south of the school spans the bottom.</abstract>
   <abstract>The Tennessee General Assembly created the Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State Normal School in 1909, but the school officially opened in 1912. In 1944, the school graduated its first master's students. In 1951 the school officially became a university. The school changed its named to Tennessee State University in 1968 and currently maintains two campuses in Nashville. It is the only public Historically Black College and University (HBCU) in Tennessee. Many of the lots sold by Riverview Realty Company were purchased by African Americans at auction on June 28, 1912.</abstract>
