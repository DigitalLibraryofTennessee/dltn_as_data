   <abstract>This hand-drawn map is of the Muscle Shoals in northern Alabama, historically the bane of steamboat traffic and chief impediment to navigation on the Tennessee River. It is hand-colored to show the river and its tributaries, range and section lines of these early public lands, as well as the Alabama towns along this stretch. These include Tuscumbia, York, Florence, Bainbridge, Courtland, and Marathon. Importantly it shows the river as it was before the construction of the Wilson Dam in 1924 and the various canals of the 1870s and 80s. The inscription on the back shows it has been a part of the Tennessee State Library's collections since 1858.</abstract>
   <abstract>The Muscle Shoals is a shallow stretch of the Tennessee River that runs through north Alabama. It was named for the plentiful mussels that were harvested there, before ""mussel"" was the de facto spelling. This map was most likely drawn as a guide for those travelling the river as this was one of the most treacherous stretches on the Tennessee River due to the shallow water.</abstract>
