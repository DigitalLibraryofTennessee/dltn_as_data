   <abstract>Early hand-drawn map of Stewart County (Tenn.) drawn before the creation of Humphreys County in 1809. The map depicts the county extending southward past the Duck River. It offers a detailed view of the county's waterways especially the Tennessee River in the early 19th century long before the creation of Kentucky Lake. The county seat of Dover is denoted as are the county's boundaries with Montgomery and Dickson counties. (The map may predate the division of Dickson County in 1807)</abstract>
   <abstract>Stewart County was established in 1803 from part of Montgomery County. It is named for Duncan Stewart, an early state legislator. Its largest city and county seat is Dover, named for the British city of the same name due to the bluffs along the Cumberland River. Dover was the site of two battles during the Civil War at Fort Donelson.</abstract>
