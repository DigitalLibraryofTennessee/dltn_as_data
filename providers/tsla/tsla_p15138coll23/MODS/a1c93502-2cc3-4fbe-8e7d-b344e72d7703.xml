   <abstract>A map of the Eastern United States showing the various avenues of trade, including those affected by the enlargement of the Erie Canal. Canals are highlighted in green, the "present" drainage of the trade of the canal is highlighted in tan, while the drainage of trade after the enlargement of the canal is highlighted in red. Railroads, completed, in progress, and proposed, are denoted. The Great Lakes, major rivers affected by the Erie Canal, and important train stations are included.</abstract>
   <abstract>The Erie Canal was undertaken in 1817 and completed in 1825, connecting the Great Lakes with the Hudson River, and thus the Atlantic Ocean. This map was created after one of the many enlargement projects aimed to increase traffic along the waterway. The Erie Canal is the most famous of the American canals and significantly lowered the cost of transporting goods between the north east and the midwest.</abstract>
