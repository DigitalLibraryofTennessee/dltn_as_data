   <abstract>Knoxville was founded in 1786 by James White as White's Fort and served as the capital of the Southwest Territory and the first capital of Tennessee. In 1791, William Blount negotiated the Treaty of Holston with the Cherokees at White's Fort. White later donated land to establish a city, named Knoxville after Secretary of War and Revolutionary War general, Henry Knox. The first state constitution was written and signed there in 1796.</abstract>
