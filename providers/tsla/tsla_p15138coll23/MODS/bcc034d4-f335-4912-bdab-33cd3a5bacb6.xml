   <abstract>Drawn from French sources (Mr. D'Anville) and published in London in 1760, this map illustrates the colonial landscape of eastern North America and Canada at the time of the imperial struggle between France and England known as the Seven Year's War (French &amp; Indian War). It is "Improved with the back settlements of Virginia and course of Ohio, illustrated with geographical and historical remarks." Map taken from between pages 134 and 135. Its chief value for Tennessee history lies in its depiction of the native Indian tribes, their settlements, colonial forts, rivers, etc. In the country of the "Cherakees" we find "Walkers Settlement 1750" on the "Cumberland or Shannoroens" River, the "Hogehege or Cherakees" [Tennessee] River, and many Cherokee towns, incl. "Tonase" which gave its name to the future state. In the country of the "Chikasaws" a "F[ort] Prudome [Prudhomme]" is shown near the future site of Memphis. The Creeks, "Chactaws" and other Southern tribes are shown.</abstract>
   <abstract>Jefferys, Thomas, -1771, known as "Geographer to King George III", was an English cartographer who was the leading map supplier of his day. He engraved and printed maps for government and produced a wide range of commercial maps and atlases, especially of North America. Map taken from between pages 134 and 135 of his volume on French Dominions in North and South America (1760).</abstract>
