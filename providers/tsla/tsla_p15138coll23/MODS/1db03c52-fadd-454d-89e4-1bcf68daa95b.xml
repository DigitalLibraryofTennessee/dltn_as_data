   <abstract>640 acres surveyed for John Evans on the north side of the Cumberland River on both sides of Evan's Spring. Warrant no. 202. Adjacent to land owned by the heirs of Edward Carvin and Ephraim McLane [McLean]. Includes the road from "Gaspars" [Kaspar Mansker's Station] to Nashville. Daniel Smith served as surveyor, while James Mulherin served as his deputy. John Johnston and George McLane [McLean] served as chain carriers. This plat represents a small area of East Nashville today, near the Inglewood neighborhood. The state seal of North Carolina is affixed.</abstract>
   <abstract>James Mulherin was amongst the earliest settlers in Davidson County. He was on the ballot for first surveyor of Davidson County, elected to the first grand jury, and was among the sureties for the entry taker and sheriff for the newly established county. Daniel Smith later became Tennessee's first secretary of state.</abstract>
