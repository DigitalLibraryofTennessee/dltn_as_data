   <abstract>This beautifully colored map of Tennessee constructed by John Melish from the surveys of John Strothers following the War of 1812. Shows early county lines and Indian boundaries prior to Jackson's Treaty and other cessions of Indian land after the war, along with some statistical and geological remarks. Western Tennessee is still Chickasaw territory, and the southeastern corner of the state is in Cherokee hands. Melish clearly was working remotely and had not been to Tennessee, as there are several fanciful mistakes such as the eastern tip of the state, the location of Reynoldsburg and the "Earthquake [Reelfoot] Lake," and numerous misspellings. Certain period features such as Fort Deposit, Southwest Point garrison, and the U.S. Agency for Cherokees are indicated.</abstract>
   <abstract>John Melish was a Scottish-born cartographer who settled in the United States in 1811, after several previous visits. Melish came to dominate the map-making industry in this country and had a huge impact on the cartographic standards of his day.</abstract>
