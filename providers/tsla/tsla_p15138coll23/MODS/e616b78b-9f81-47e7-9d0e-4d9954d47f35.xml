   <abstract>Map of residential tract belonging to the Watauga Development Corporation (WDC) near downtown Elizabethton, Tennessee taken from the Tennessee Supreme Court case Dr. W. T. Moncrief, Sr. v. Watauga Development Corporation, et al. The tract appears to have been planned for workers' communities connected with the German-owned rayon manufacturers American Bemberg Corporation and American Glanzstoff Corporation based in Elizabethton. WDC held significant property near both plants. This plat map shows the Watauga River, Riverside Park, streets, some buildings and residential lots in the neighborhood.</abstract>
   <abstract>In the Elizabethton rayon workers' strikes of 1929, workers complained of being forced to rent from WDC and being charged high rents. The Depression (and, perhaps, the 1929 strikes as well) put an end to the grandiose plans for worker communities embodied by the Watauga Development Corporation, which went bankrupt in the 1930s. Dr. W. T. Moncrief, Sr. v. Watauga Development Corporation, et al. was filed by Dr. Moncrief to force the defendants to relocate the park/playground located between Hemlock and Hickory Streets.</abstract>
