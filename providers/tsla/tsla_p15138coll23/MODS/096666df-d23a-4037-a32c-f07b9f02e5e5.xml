   <abstract>This hand-drawn map depicts the Rhea County common school districts from about 1860. It was drawn in the common school records ledger, now on microfilm at the Tennessee State Library and Archives. Descriptions of the districts can be found on Reel 34 of the Rhea County microfilm.</abstract>
   <abstract>Rhea County was formed in 1807 from Roane County, and was split to form Meigs County in 1836. It is named for Revolutionary War veteran and Tennessee statesman, John Rhea. The county seat and largest city is Dayton, originally called Smith's Crossroads. It was renamed in 1877 after the city of Dayton, Ohio. Dayton was the stage for the famous Scopes Trial in 1925. Washington was the most important city in Rhea County until the Cincinnati Southern Railway was laid out four miles west of it in 1880.</abstract>
