   <abstract>In 1890, E. E. Meacham acquired land that had been part of Deaderick Plantation. He built a segregated neighborhood, Orange Mound, for African American homeowners, named after the Osage Orange hedges that had lined the Deaderick Plantation. The neighborhood originally contained 982 shotgun houses. Living in Orange Mound became something of a status symbol among black Memphians because one could own rather than rent a house. The neighborhood itself fostered a strong sense of community and identity.</abstract>
