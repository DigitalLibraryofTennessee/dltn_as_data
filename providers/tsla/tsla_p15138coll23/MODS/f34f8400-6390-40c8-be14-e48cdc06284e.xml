   <abstract>Plates 135 and 136 from Volume 2 of the 1897 edition of Sanborn's Nashville atlas. The William Gerst Brewing Company's sprawling campus located near the Nashville, Chattanooga, and St. Louis rail yards. Liberty Mills's warehouses flank the railroad. The St. Bernard Coal Company, John Oman stone works, and Bass St. Baptist Church buildings appear. St. Cloud Hill and Fort Negley are located in the bottom right, however no details were included. A nonadjacent inset is located in the top right showing the F. Edelmon Distilling Company on the corner of Hill and Donelson Streets.</abstract>
   <abstract>Daniel Alfred Sanborn, a civil engineer and surveyor, began working on fire insurance maps in the 1860s and his company soon became one of the largest and most successful American map companies. Sanborn's first work mapping cities for insurance purposes began in Tennessee when Aetna Insurance hired him to survey a few towns across the state, however none of these earliest examples are known to exist today (Ristow, Walter W. "United States Fire Insurance and Underwriters Maps· 1852—1968." The Quarterly Journal of the Library of Congress 25, no. 3 (1968): 194-218." Sanborn maps were originally created to estimate fire insurance risks. Insurance companies would decide how much insurance, if any, was to be offered to a customer solely through the use of a Sanborn map. Today, the maps are frequently used for historical research and for preservation and restoration purposes.</abstract>
