   <abstract>This very detailed map presents, in addition to roads, streams, communities, house structures and hollows, the iron ore industry in Lewis County (Tenn." It details the locations of iron ore mines, partly prospected banks, and surface indications of ores in the county. Positions of trails, roads, railroads, rivers, streams, brooks, and creeks are included. Latitudinal and longitudinal lines are indicated.The data for this map were taken from a Tennessee Geological Survey.</abstract>
   <abstract>Iron ore has been one of Tennessee's most important natural resources since the 1790's. Tennessee was ranked third nationally in iron bloomery production in 1860, with Lewis County being amongst the leaders in the state. As the easily accessible deposits were gone by the early 19th century, iron mining and production in Tennessee ebbed. By 1992, Tennessee was 31st in the nation in mining by value, however, iron ore was not among the state's most valuable minerals.</abstract>
