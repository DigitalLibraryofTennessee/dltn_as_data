   <abstract>From the recollections of Mrs. Harriet Temple the daughter of Duncan Robertson. Shows Nashville in 1804 with landscape, dwellings, businesses and the Cumberland River. Eichbaum also lightly noted some present day streets as they were at the time of the creation of the map, presumably to give viewers some current reference points. Some of the referenced buildings include Talbot Tavern, Old Stone Tavern, Judge McNairy's, the former fort, Dr. Henning's house, the Court House, and various stores and guesthouses. A numbered key is located at the bottom.</abstract>
   <abstract>William A. Eichbaum was born in Dublin, Ireland in April 1787. His father was a German immigrant, who worked in Ireland as a glass maker. William immigrated to America around 1820, after a brief journey to Peru. In 1825, he married Catharine M. Stearns, a teacher at Nashville Female Academy. Eichbaum became one of Nashville's foremost booksellers in the mod-19th century. He participated in many philanthropic and societal organizations including the Davidson County Bible Society, Horticultural Society, Nashville Historical Society, Mount Olivet Cemetery Company, and Nashville Savings Company. He died on January 1, 1873. (Letter from J. D. Eichbaum to Anson Nelson, T-100 Collection, Tennessee Historical Society) Eichbaum's sketchbook is housed at Nashville Public Library and contains another version of this map.</abstract>
