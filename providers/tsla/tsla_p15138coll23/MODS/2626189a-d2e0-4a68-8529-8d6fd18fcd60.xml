   <abstract>Henry E. Colton was born in Fayetteville, North Carolina in 1836. By 1858, he served as editor of the Asheville Spectator before publishing Mountain Scenery: The Scenery of the Mountains of Western North Carolina and Northwestern South Carolina, his most famous work. Colton enlisted in the Confederate Army in 1862 and joined the 36th Regiment before being assigned to the 13th battalion of North Carolina artillery. After the war, Colton worked for the New York World. He moved to Chattanooga and eventually Knoxville, where he worked as a geologist for the state. Colton died in 1892 in Knoxville."(Dictionary of North Carolina Biography edited by William S. Powell. Copyright (c) 1979-1996 by the University of North Carolina Press)</abstract>
