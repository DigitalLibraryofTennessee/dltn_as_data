   <abstract>Samuel Weakley's plat map shows early land claims and "pre-emptions" along Richland Creek near its junction with the Cumberland River west of Nashville, Tenn. (Pre-emptions were 640-acre tracts granted by North Carolina to original settlers who had taken the considerable risk to come to the Cumberland and make improvements on the land.) Additional information about each plot is shown including: owner, date of acquisition, acreage, and border markers. Included is the land and homeplace on Richland Creek of James Robertson, one of the founders of Nashville and leader of the early Cumberland settlements. Also shown are the pre-emption grants of John and Daniel Dunham, elements of which eventually made up parts of Belle Meade plantation.</abstract>
   <abstract>Samuel Anderson Weakley was a chief in the operation division of the U.S. Corps of Engineers in Nashville, Tenn. as well as a genealogist. He did careful deed research to produce his plats of early North Carolina land grants, which can be found in TSLA's collection of his papers. He assembled the greater part of his research into a book, "The Southern Virginia Weakley Families and Their Descendents," also available at the Library &amp; Archives.</abstract>
