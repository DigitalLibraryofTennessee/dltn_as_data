   <abstract>This very detailed map of Scott County was drawn by the Tennessee Valley Authority in 1935. It shows roads, railroads, rivers, streams, and creeks; lumber and coal operations in what is now Big South Fork National River &amp; Recreation Area are shown. Many buildings are denoted including churches, schools, as well as cemeteries. There is drawing in pencil on the original map denoting elementary schools with triangles, and elementary and high schools with a triangle enclosed with a rectangle. A triangle with a marking in one corner indicates it is the exact location of said school. School bus routes are designated with a dotted line.</abstract>
   <abstract>Scott County was established in 1849 from parts of Anderson, Campbell, Fentress and Morgan counties. It was named for Mexican War hero General Winfield Scott. Its county seat is Huntsville, while its largest city is Oneida. Scott County was the most strongly opposed county to Tennessee's secession in 1861. It went as far as seceding from Tennessee, and thus the Confederacy, to form the "State of Scott," a resolution that was not repealed until 1986.</abstract>
