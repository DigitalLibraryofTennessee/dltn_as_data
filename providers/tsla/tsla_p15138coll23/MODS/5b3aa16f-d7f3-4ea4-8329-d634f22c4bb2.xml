   <abstract>Printed map of Nashville depicting the city in 1854. The old street names are drawn, and a number of churches, schools, masonic buildings, banks, schools, and businesses are denoted. The State Penitentiary and Hospital lie further from the city center, as does McNairy's [Judge John McNairy's home]. Adolphus Heiman's suspension bridge is indicated spanning the Cumberland River. From A. W. Putnam's History of Middle Tennessee.</abstract>
   <abstract>The Nashville Female Academy opened in 1816 under Dr. C.D. Elliot. The school was forced to close when it was unable to recover from the disruptions of the Civil War, in which it served as Federal Military Hospital 14. During its time as a military hospital, the academy held 350 cots, 191 patients, and 5 surgeons. (Plaisance and Schelver, "Federal Military Hospitals in Nashville, May and June 1863." Tennessee Historical Quarterly, Vol. 29, No. 2)</abstract>
