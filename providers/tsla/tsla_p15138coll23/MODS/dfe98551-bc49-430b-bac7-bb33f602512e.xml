   <abstract>Hand-drawn map of Campbell County, filed with Tennessee Secretary of State Luke Lea, that outlines the newly established civil districts. The Clinch River and Powel's [Powell] River are shown. Mountain ranges are drawn and named, including Cumberland Mountain and Cross Mountain. Jacksboro is indicated as a circle with a dot. Surveyor's calls for each civil district's boundaries are provided.</abstract>
   <abstract>These 1836 county maps showing the new civil districts, required by the new state constitution, written in 1834 and ratified the following year, which mandated such civil divisions for taxation purposes, were done for many counties. Campbell County was created in 1806 from portions of Anderson and Claiborne counties. It is named for Revolutionary War veteran and Overmountain man Colonel Arthur Campbell. Its county seat is Jacksboro (originally Walnut Grove) named for Andrew Jackson, while its largest city is LaFollette, named for the first landowners in the area.</abstract>
