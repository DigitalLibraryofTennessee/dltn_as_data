   <abstract>Hand-drawn map of the town of Denmark, Tennessee, John Johnston's hometown, displaying the number-coded locations of homes, farms, roads, railroads, the town store, post office, and cemetery. The map depicts the town as it would have appeared at the time of the Battle of Britton Lane in Sept. 1862, when Forrest sent 87 captured Federal cavalrymen to the Presbyterian church/Masonic lodge in Denmark. It also displays the location of hills, Big Black Creek, and other topographical features.</abstract>
   <abstract>John Johnston was born in 1842 and joined the Confederate army in April 1861. He served in Nathan Bedford Forrest's cavalry during the war. Following the war he became a lawyer in Memphis and wrote a memoir of his experiences during the Civil War. He died in 1928.</abstract>
