   <abstract>Robert Armstrong's 1819 survey for a Cherokee chief, "the Pathkiller," on the south side of the Tennessee River at his ferry. Plat and surveyor's description of 640 acre tract. Such 'reservations' were granted to tribal heads of families "residing within the ceded territory" of land in southeastern Tennessee, conveyed by the Cherokee to the United States by the 1819 treaty. David Taylor and Taylor Eldridge served as chain carriers. Plat also shows Pathkiller's dwelling house adjacent to ferry.</abstract>
   <abstract>Pathkiller was the last hereditary chief of the Cherokee. He fought the Overmountain Men and other Watauga frontiersmen with Dragging Canoe in the Cherokee-American Wars. He served as a colonel under Andrew Jackson in the Creek Wars, including at Horseshoe Bend. A full-blooded Native American, he was the Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation from 1811-1827. This land was the subject of multiple Tennessee Supreme Court cases between Pathkiller and John Blair.</abstract>
