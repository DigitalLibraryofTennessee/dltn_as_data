   <abstract>Chuck Minton's hand drawn map of the Clinch and Powell rivers, their tributaries, and the valley between, as described in "Annals of Tennessee" by J. G. M. Ramsey and various early Claiborne County, Tenn. deeds. Used to accompany Ramsey's description of the Transylvania Purchase in these river valleys. Also includes the Claiborne County deed text. Located in a box on top of map cases with oversized maps.</abstract>
   <abstract>The Transylvania Purchase was a private venture by Richard Henderson and the Transylvania Company to obtain 20 million acres of land in present-day Kentucky and Tennessee in order to establish a 14th colony. Henderson negotiated this agreement with the Cherokee on March 14, 1775, and he, along with other settlers, drew up the Transylvania Compact, framing the fledgling government. However, his plan was thwarted when Virginia annexed the land and voided the agreement. Henderson was allowed to retain rights to 12 square miles (about 7700 acres), and thereafter attempted to settle the Tennessee portion at Nashborough.</abstract>
