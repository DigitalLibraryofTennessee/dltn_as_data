   <abstract>Hand-drawn map, with accompanying civil district boundary descriptions, of Sumner County shows the civil districts that were laid off pursuant to an act of the Tennessee General Assembly on December 3, 1835. The map also displays roads, mills (including an important early papermill on the Cumberland River), cities, residences, district lines, county lines, and historic features such as Bledsoe's Lick. Geographic features include creeks, a ridge, and the Cumberland River. A legend appears in the lower right corner detailing each geographic feature.</abstract>
   <abstract>Sumner County was established in 1786 as a part of North Carolina. In the early 1790s it was part of the Mero District of the Territory South of the River Ohio until joining Tennessee upon admittance to the union in 1796. It is named for Revolutionary War hero General Jethro Sumner. Its county seat is Gallatin, named for U.S. Treasury Secretary, Albert Gallatin, while its largest city today is Hendersonville, named for early settler William Henderson and shown on this map from its days as a small village.</abstract>
