   <abstract>Map of Bedford County, showing the civil districts that were laid off pursuant to the act of assembly of December 11, 1835. The map includes a dotted line titled ""Webster's line,"" and the six civil districts that lie west of this demarcation would later make up Marshall County. Each district indicates a residence which it is believed were polling places where voting would take place within the district. The Duck River and tributaries run through the center of the county. Shelbyville, other towns, and crossroads indicated.</abstract>
   <abstract>Bedford County was created on December 7, 1807 by the Tennessee General Assembly, by splitting Rutherford County in two. It was named for Revolutionary War officer Thomas Bedford, while its county seat, Shelbyville, was named for Revolutionary war soldier and Kentucky governor Isaac Shelby. In 1836, the six westernmost districts that appear in this map were separated to create Marshall County.</abstract>
