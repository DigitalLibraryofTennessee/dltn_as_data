   <abstract>Extremely detailed French topographic map showing a portion of the Meuse department to the west and north of the town of Verdun. Based on an 1835 War Department map and revised in 1911, it names every wood (""bois"") and enclosed field (""ferme"") and a great many place-names; such maps were used for military operations. Farmland, forest, rivers, and hills make up the landscape. Roads, railroads, dwellings, and forts are indicated. Scale 1:80,000. Plate 35. Little of the battlefield for the catastrophic 1916 Battle of Verdun is shown, since most of it lay off-map to the east of the town and Meuse River. However, this map does show a small portion of the road to the southwest that would become the famous Voie Sacree, the re-supply route that saved the French stand at Verdun.</abstract>
   <abstract>Fought from February 21 to December 16, 1916, Verdun was one of the largest and bloodiest battles of World War I. Over 2 million French and German troops engaged one another for 10 months, fired over 10 million shells, and suffered almost a million casualties. This map was produced earlier than World War I (rev. 1911) but is included in a scrapbook of World War I materials belonging to Jacob McGavock Dickinson Jr. presumably while in military service in France.</abstract>
