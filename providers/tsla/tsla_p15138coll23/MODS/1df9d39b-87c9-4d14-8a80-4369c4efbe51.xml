   <abstract>Hand-drawn and colored map of Hamblen County. Roads are drawn in yellow, county borders are shown in red, and water in blue. Morristown is at the crossroads of the East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad, the Cincinnati, Cumberland Gap, and Charleston Railroad (unfinished north of town), the Old Stage Road and Kentucky Road. Long's Ferry, Noe's Ferry, Maze's Ford, Mount Sterling, Panther Springs, and Talbott's Station are all indicated. Along the old stage road is a red line indicating the old county line between Grainger and Jefferson counties. A portion of the Rogersville Railroad is shown.""Completed this survey on the 15th day of April 1870. Party engaged with me in the survey were Col. B. F. Cluck, R. E. Rice, A. J. Donaldson, J. C. Davis, O. R. Watkins, surveyor." This is likely the first map of the county to be drawn.</abstract>
