   <abstract>Hand-drawn map of Jefferson County that establishes the new civil district lines. Bulls Gap and parts of the French Broad River and the Holston River are shown along with roads, named streams, Bays Mountain and the town of Dandridge. Included are the descriptive surveyors notes with the metes and bounds for each civil district. Some residences, likely district polling places, are indicated. The red ink marking civil district lines and numbers has faded, and the four commissioners who drew the "platt" refer to the new civil boundaries as "Magesterial [sic] Districts," an anachronistic nod to the old justice of the peace or magistrate's districts that civil districts replaced.</abstract>
   <abstract>These 1836 county maps showing the new civil districts, required by the new state constitution, written in 1834 and ratified the following year, which mandated such civil divisions for taxation and election purposes, were done for many counties. Jefferson County was established in 1792 by William Blount, Governor of the Southwest Territory and signer of the United States Constitution. Its largest city is Jefferson City and its county seat is Dandridge. During the Civil War, Jefferson County was pro-Union and actually voted against Tennessee's secession.</abstract>
