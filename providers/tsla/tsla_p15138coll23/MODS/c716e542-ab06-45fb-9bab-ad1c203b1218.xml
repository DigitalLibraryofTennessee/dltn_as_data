   <abstract>Hand-drawn map of McMinn County showing civil districts as well as the township and range grid of the so-called Hiawassee District created by the 1819 treaty with the Cherokee. The Hiwassee River and its tributaries are shown, colored in blue. The towns of Athens and Calhoon [Calhoun] are denoted as well as certain 640-acre Cherokee reservations given to the signatories of the Cherokee Treaty of 1819. The recipients include McIntosh, Barns, Walker, and Stars [Starr's]. The map suggests suggests Cherokee inhabitants to the south and southeast.</abstract>
   <abstract>These 1836 county maps showing the new civil districts, required by the new state constitution, written in 1834 and ratified the following year, which mandated such civil divisions for taxation and election purposes, were done for many counties. McMinn County was formed from land acquired in the Cherokee Treaty of 1819, known as the Hiwassee District. It is named for Revolutionary War veteran, territorial and state legislator, and ultimately governor of Tennessee, Joseph McMinn. Its county seat and largest city is Athens, named for the Greek city.</abstract>
