Historic Roman names for certain features are written in separate font. Each county is outlined by watercolor. Thousands of family and place names from the 1700s are indicated on this map, making it highly useful for Scottish genealogy.</abstract>
   <abstract>John Ainslie was a Scottish surveyor and cartographer active in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. He was born in Jedburgh, Scotland in 1745 and educated at the Jedburgh Grammar School. He served as an apprentice to the Geographer to King George III, Thomas Jefferys. Ainslie returned to Scotland and began work on surveying and mapping Scottish counties and islands. From 1787 to 1789 he worked on his groundbreaking map of Scotland, the most accurate of its time. In 1812 he published A Comprehensive Treatise on Land Surveying comprising the Theory and Practice of all its Branches, one of the preeminent surveying works of the time. Ainslie died in Edinburgh in 1828.</abstract>
