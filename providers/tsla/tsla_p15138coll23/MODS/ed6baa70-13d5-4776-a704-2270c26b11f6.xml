   <abstract>W. W. Fergusson was born in Smith County in 1831 to Adam and Hester Fergusson. He studied law at Cumberland College in Lebanon. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Fergusson volunteered for the Confederate Army and was attached to the 2nd Tennessee, as a topographical engineer, under Colonel William B. Bate. After participation at the First Battle of Bull Run, the unit was transferred under Col. J. G. Walker and they moved to Evansport to erect batteries along the Potomac. In February 1862, he was ordered to Knoxville to help construct defenses, and after the fall of Forts Donelson and Henry, rendezvoused with the Army of Mississippi to meet the Union at Shiloh. Fergusson went on to participate in the Chattanooga and Atlanta campaigns and surrendered with the Army of Tennessee at Greensboro, North Carolina in 1865. After the war, Fergusson opened Blackgnat Academy in Riddleton, practiced law, and married Medora Kerby, with whom he had eight children. Fergusson died in 1922.</abstract>
