   <abstract>Early 20th century map showing Grundy, Sequatchie and Bledsoe counties, likely used by county health departments in their service to schools. Map names white and "colored" schools, streams, communities and towns and shows civil districts, roads and portions of the Nashville, Chattanooga, and St. Louis Railway. There is drawing in red pencil on the original map denoting elementary schools with triangles, and elementary and high schools with a triangle enclosed with a rectangle. A triangle with a marking in one corner indicates it is the exact location of said school.</abstract>
   <abstract>Sequatchie County was formed in 1857 from a parts of Bledsoe, Hamilton, and Marion counties. It is named for the Sequatchie Valley, which is named for a Cherokee chief, Sequachee, which possibly translates to either "opossum" or "he grins or runs." Its county seat and largest city is Dunlap, named for Tennessee congressman William Dunlap, who helped orchestrate the county's formation.</abstract>
