   <abstract>Drawn just before the Civil War, the Haydon &amp; Booth map of Nashville is one of the most detailed and informative depictions of the antebellum city (plus the Edgefield community). In addition to a street map, it provides a 2-dimensional rendering of the footprint of each house and structure, block-by-city block. It also names civic and private buildings, landowners, and significant natural features such as streams and springs.</abstract>
