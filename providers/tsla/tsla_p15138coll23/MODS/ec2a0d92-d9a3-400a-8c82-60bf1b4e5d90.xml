   <abstract>Hand-drawn map of of Nashville depicting the city in 1854. The old street names are drawn, and a number of churches, schools, masonic buildings, banks, schools, and businesses are denoted. The State Penitentiary and Hospital lie further from the city center, as does McNairy's [Judge John McNairy's home]. Adolphus Heiman's suspension bridge is indicated spanning the Cumberland River. Another version of this map comes from A. W. Putnam's History of Middle Tennessee. See item 43511.</abstract>
   <abstract>William A. Eichbaum was born in Dublin, Ireland in April 1787. His father was a German immigrant, who worked in Ireland as a glass maker. William immigrated to America around 1820, after a brief journey to Peru. In 1825, he married Catharine M. Stearns, a teacher at Nashville Female Academy. Eichbaum became one of Nashville's foremost booksellers in the mid-19th century. He participated in many philanthropic and societal organizations including the Davidson County Bible Society, Horticultural Society, Nashville Historical Society, Mount Olivet Cemetery Company, and Nashville Savings Company. He died on January 1, 1873. (Letter from J. D. Eichbaum to Anson Nelson, T-100 Collection, Tennessee Historical Society) Eichbaum's sketchbook is housed at Nashville Public Library and contains another version of this map.</abstract>
