   <abstract>Reprint of an illustrated "aerial" map of Knoxville, Tenn. from 1886 showing commercial buildings, churches, schools, businesses, and public buildings. The Tennessee River runs through the lower section of the map with steamboats passing along it. In the bottom left corner is The Hill and The Circle of Tennessee University (current day University of Tennessee), both of which are still a part of campus today. Streets are named and there is a numbered key at the bottom.</abstract>
   <abstract>Bird's-eye view maps were mostly popular toward the end of the 19th century, and served to attract both workers and businesses to growing small towns across the country. This is a reproduction of the original map done in 1975 by Historic Urban Plans from a lithograph at the Library of Congress. It is number 51 of an edition limited to 500 copies.</abstract>
