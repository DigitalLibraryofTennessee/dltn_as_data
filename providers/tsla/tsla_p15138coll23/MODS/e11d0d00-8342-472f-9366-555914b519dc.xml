   <abstract>The town of La Grange is situated on a Chickasaw trading village. The first white inhabitants were granted land following the 1818 treatry with the Chickasaw. The town became an important pot for farmers to bring their goods to market when the La Grange and Memphis railroad began construction in the late 1830s. This track was eventually purchased by the Memphis and Charleston Railroad, one of the most important in the antebellum South. La Grange's population was tabulated at 133 in the most recent census.</abstract>
