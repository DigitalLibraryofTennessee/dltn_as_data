  <abstract>Written from Marion Furnace, located in Wayne County, TN, R.C. Hemphill expresses curiousity in this letter over the nomination of James K. Polk as president and also raises a question over the annexation of Texas.</abstract>
  <abstract>During the presidential election of 1844, the annexation of Texas and the expansion of slavery was a major issue. The Whig Party nominee, Henry Clay, adopted an anti-annexation platform on the principle of preserving the North-South sectional unity and to avoid war by respecting Mexico's claims to Texas. The Democrats nominated James K. Polk who ran on a platform that embraced America's popular commitment to territorial expansion, often referred to as Manifest Destiny. During the presidential campaign, Polk successfully linked the United States-British boundary dispute over the partition of Oregon Territory with the Texas annexation debate. By doing so, Polk united the anti-slavery Northern expansionists, who demanded Oregon as free from slavery with pro-slavery Southern expansionists, who insisted on acquiring Texas as a slave state. After a hard fought campaign, James K. Polk was elected as the eleventh president of the United States.</abstract>
