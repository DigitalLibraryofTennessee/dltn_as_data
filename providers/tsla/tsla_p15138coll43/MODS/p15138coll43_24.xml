  <abstract>This letter addresses the issue over slavery in territories in the west, specifically discussing the plan for the "Nashville Convention," a meeting which was held in June 1850 to discuss a course of action in Tennessee should Congress decide to ban slavery in the new territories. Additionally, the author goes on to provide his views on the admission of California into the Union.</abstract>
  <abstract>In July of 1848, the Mexican War ended with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. With this treaty, the border between the United States and Mexico was fixed at the Rio Grande, and Mexico gave up all or part of modern California, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. James K. Polk considered it his greatest success to have acquired the California ports of San Diego, Monterey, and San Francisco. In 1849, stories of the "abundance of gold" led many people to travel to California in what was referred to as the "California Gold Rush." As a result of the "Gold Rush" the territory of California grew rapidly and it eventually became an official state on September 9, 1850.</abstract>
