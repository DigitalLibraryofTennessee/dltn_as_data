  <abstract>This political cartoon depicts James K. Polk in a hurricane scene as he hurries to his goal, the annexation of Texas. It also shows flying tools that symbolize the tariff issue that was another prominent campaign issue during the presidential election of 1844.</abstract>
  <abstract>During the presidential election of 1844, the annexation of Texas and the tariff questions were major campaign issues. The Whigs labeled James K. Polk as a "free trader" because of his strong antiprotectionist record for low duty. To win the election, Polk was advised to provide a fair, equal, and adequate protection tariff to American industry. In the political cartoon, the industries are symbolized by flying tools while the protectionist ram butts him for his duty-free statement on wool.</abstract>
