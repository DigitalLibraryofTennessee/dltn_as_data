  <abstract>Book of five labor plays created by Highlander Folk School, including "North-South," "Look-Ahead, Dixie," Stretch-Out," "Dues Blues," and "Lolly Pop Poppa: A Musical Farce" by Zilphia Horton.</abstract>
  <abstract>Zilphia Horton was a musician, organizer, educator, Civil Rights activist, and folklorist. Horton was born in Spadra, Arkansas, to Robert Guy Johnson and Ora Ermon Howard Johnson. Her father was the superintendent of a coal mine. Zilphia was attracted to the labor movement by Claude Williams, who attempted to organize the coal miners into the Progressive Miners' Union, for which she was disowned by her father. After graduating from the College of the Ozarks, she attended a labor workshop at Highlander Folk Center where she met its founder Myles Horton. The two married just months later and Zilphia became the school's musical and drama director. She is credited with turning "We Will Overcome" into the Civil Rights' anthem "We Shall Overcome." Horton died tragically in 1956 after accidently ingesting a bottle of typewriter fluid.</abstract>
