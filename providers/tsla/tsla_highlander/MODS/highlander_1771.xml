  <abstract>Program listing events and menu for holiday alumni banquet. The menu included chicken a la king, peas, mashed potatoes, sweet potato pie, and hot rolls.

  <abstract>Malcolm H. Ross was a labor activist in the early 20th century. His book Machine Age in the Hills examined the industrial exploitation of coal and timber industries in Appalachia. President Franklin Roosevelt selected him to chair the Fair Employment Practices Committee, which was designed to prevent discrimination against African Americans in government employment, particularly in the War Department. Roosevelt created this organization after lobbying by A. Phillip Randolph and Mary McLeod Bethune. Ross continued work in labor organizing, publishing books. Some of his papers are housed at the FDR Presidential Library.</abstract>
