  <abstract>Reagin writes to Gov. Ellington in support of Highlander Folk School, having read of the state's investigation in the Memphis Commercial Appeal. Reagin, a minister in the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, participated in summer workshops and knew Myles Horton. He hopes the Governor will learn about Highlander and help Tennesseans know of their mission instead of pursuing an investigation.</abstract>
  <abstract>Ewell J. Reagin, a Chicago resident at the time of this letter, grew up in McKenzie, Tennessee, where his father, Ewell Kerr Reagin, was the president of Bethel College. The younger Reagin graduated from the University of Tennessee and became an ordained minister in the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. Reagin participated in summer workshops at Highlander and supported their mission.</abstract>
