  <abstract>Summerfield News for the week of November 21, 1942. The issue lists programs for the week, discusses the Summerfield Cooperative, a recent forest fire, and includes a recipe for sweet potato biscuits.</abstract>
  <abstract>The Summerfield Cooperative was established by seven members of the Summerfield community in Grundy County to clothe local school children in the winter months. They eventually became affiliated with the local Farmers' Union but were never large enough to be self-sustaining and relied on Highlander's support. They still contributed to the community through sewing and canning projects but were overshadowed by larger organizations.</abstract>
