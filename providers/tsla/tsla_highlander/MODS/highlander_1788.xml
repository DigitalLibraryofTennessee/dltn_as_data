  <abstract>Photograph of a Civil Rights workshop, probably on desegregation, held at Highlander Folk School's library. Rosa Parks is seated in the front row while Anne Braden is seated near the back.</abstract>
  <abstract>In the early 1950s, Highlander Folk School shifted its focus from labor rights to civil rights and hosted a number of workshops on school integration that attracted Civil Rights leaders from across the South including Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, Fannie Lou Hamer, Esau Jenkins, and numerous others. These sessions spawned citizenship schools that were held across the Southeast, starting in the Sea Islands, South Carolina, to educate black voters how to pass the state-imposed literacy tests in order to vote.</abstract>
