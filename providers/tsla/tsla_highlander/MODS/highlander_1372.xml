  <abstract>Copy of the House Un-American Activities Committee report on Aubrey Williams. HUAC, paralleling investigations by Senator Joseph McCarthy, was at the epicenter of the "Red Scare" in the United States. The Committee was tasked with rooting out any real or perceived subversive (read Communist) threats in America. During this time period, desegregationists, labor organizers, and Civil Rights leaders were often investigated.</abstract>
  <abstract>Aubrey Williams was born in Springville, Alabama, in 1890. He grew up poor and worked to put himself through Maryville College in East Tennessee. He joined the French Foreign Legion in World War I and afterwards obtained a doctorate from the University of Bordeaux, France. After a short career of social work in Ohio and Wisconsin, Williams served as an administrator in the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, helped establish and administer the Civil Works Administration and Works Progress Administration, and directed the National Youth Administration. Following his time with the Roosevelt Administration, Williams ran the Southern Conference Educational Fund, fighting to end segregation. He died in 1965.</abstract>
