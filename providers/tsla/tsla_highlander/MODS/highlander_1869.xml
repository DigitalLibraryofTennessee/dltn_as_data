  <abstract>Guy Carawan singing "Three Little Pigs" on a record recorded at Highlander Folk School.</abstract>
  <abstract>Guy Carawan was a folk musician and served as Highlander's musical director following Zilphia Horton's death. Carawan is credited with turning We Shall Overcome into a Civil Rights anthem after learning the song from Zilphia Horton at Highlander. Carawan met his future wife Candie Anderson, a Fisk exchange student and an early white participant in sit-ins, at Highlander. Later in life, the Carawans lived near Highlander Research and Education Center in New Market, where he died in 2015.</abstract>
