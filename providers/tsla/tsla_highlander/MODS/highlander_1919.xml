  <abstract>Photograph of the main building at Highlander Folk School</abstract>
  <abstract>Highlander Folk School was established in 1932, by Myles Horton, Don West, Jim Dombrowski, and others to train and organize Southern laborers. Horton's inspiration came from Reinhold Niebuhr, one of his professors at Union Theological Seminary, a proponent of Christian Socialism. Horton visited a number of Danish Folk Schools and decided to establish one in his home state of Tennessee. The school was founded on land donated by Dr. Lillian Johnson in Monteagle, Tennessee. The 1930s and 1940s saw Highlander train textile and industrial workers as well as union organizers across the South as an arm of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). In the 1950s, Highlander shifted its focus to Civil Rights and school integration. Staff, including Septima Clark and Bernice Robinson, held workshops to train organizers and held citizenship courses to help African Americans pass onerous literacy tests in order to vote. They eventually trained teachers to expand their network across the South. Their focus on integration brought unwanted attention from red-baiting, segregationist Southern state governments who investigated and eventually shuttered the school in 1961. Highlander was reopened the next day in Knoxville as the Highlander Research and Education Center in Knoxville, Tennessee. It moved to its current home in New Market in 1972. From the 1970s through the 1990s, Highlander worked to support the people of Appalachia defending its landscape and people from destructive environmental and labor practices. Highlander has continued its mission to advocate for worker's rights as well as human rights to this day.</abstract>
