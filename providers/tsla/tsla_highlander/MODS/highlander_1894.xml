  <abstract>Typewritten copy of letter from Reinhold Niebuhr. Niebuhr states that he is shocked to hear that Highlander is under investigation when the school is anti-communist. He supposes it is solely because of Highlander's integration activities.</abstract>
  <abstract>Reinhold Niebuhr was a theologian and professor at Union Theological Seminary. Niebuhr was born to German immigrants in Missouri. He studied at Elmhurst College and Yale Divinity School. He was a prominent pacifist and socialist, but strongly anti-communist. Niebuhr's ideology influenced a number of important 20th century American labor, political, and spiritual leaders including Myles Horton and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. who mentioned Niebuhr in his Letter from Birmingham Jail. Niebuhr received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1964. Niebuhr died in 1971.</abstract>
