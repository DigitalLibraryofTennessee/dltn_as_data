  <abstract>Published conversation between Dr. Charles Gomillion and Myles Horton. Gomillion posed three questions to Horton regarding Highlander's goals for the forthcoming year. What are the three most important contributions which Highlander Folk School can make toward the implementation of the concept of civic democracy in the South during 1959? What can Negro citizens in the South do most effectively, and honorably, during 1959 to reduce the anxiety, allay the fears, and weaken the resistance of those white citizens who are striving desperately to maintain the status quo in race relations?</abstract>
  <abstract>Dr. Charles Goode Gomillion was a civil rights activist and educator. Gomillion was born in South Carolina in 1900. where his father was formerly enslaved. He didn't receive much schooling until his mother began homeschooling him in the eighth grade and he saved enough money to attend Paine High School in Augusta, Georgia. Gomillion enrolled at Paine College, but dropped out to care for his disabled parents. He became a middle school teacher and completed his bachelor's at Paine College. Gomillion then joined the faculty at Tuskegee Institute. He worked at Tuskegee for over 40 years but had brief stints studying sociology at Fisk University in Nashville, the University of Chicago, and Ohio State University, where he received his doctorate in sociology in 1959. He advocated for voter education and black voter registration after experiencing his own troubles with registering to vote. He was the lead plaintiff in the landmark Supreme Court case Gomillion v. Lightfoot that declared racial gerrymandering illegal. Gomillion had a distinguished career as a civil rights activist and sociology professor and served on Highlander Folk School's board of directors.</abstract>
