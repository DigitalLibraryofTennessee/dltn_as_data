  <abstract>An original typed song sheet featuring the lyrics to eight labor songs, including "Not Going to Work and Starve No More," "My Union Card," "Solidarity Forever," "Rise Up, Ye Workers," "Poor Miners Farewell," "International," "Build the Union," and "Give me Back my Job Again.".</abstract>
  <abstract>Labor unions have long used songs to build support for their movements, reaffirm their goals, and highlight injustices. Highlander brought together Southern laborers and organizers to teach them how to organize, and the usefulness of singing to garner support for their movements. Highlander's first musical director, Zilphia Horton, taught songs to students as well as brought in notable folk singers such as Pete Seeger and Guy Carawan to perform for the school.</abstract>
