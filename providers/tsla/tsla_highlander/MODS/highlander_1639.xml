  <abstract>Photograph of Charles Gomillion. This image was an exhibit in Tennessee's investigation into Highlander Folk School.</abstract>
  <abstract>Dr. Charles Goode Gomillion was a civil rights activist and educator. Gomillion was born in South Carolina in 1900. where his father was formerly enslaved. He didn't receive much schooling until his mother began homeschooling him in the eighth grade and he saved enough money to attend Paine High School in Augusta, Georgia. Gomillion enrolled at Paine College, but dropped out to care for his disabled parents. He became a middle school teacher and completed his bachelor's at Paine College. Gomillion then joined the faculty at Tuskegee Institute. He worked at Tuskegee for over 40 years but had brief stints studying sociology at Fisk University in Nashville, the University of Chicago, and Ohio State University, where he received his doctorate in sociology in 1959. He advocated for voter education and black voter registration after experiencing his own troubles with registering to vote. He was the lead plaintiff in the landmark Supreme Court case Gomillion v. Lightfoot that declared racial gerrymandering illegal. Gomillion had a distinguished career as a civil rights activist and sociology professor and served on Highlander Folk School's board of directors.</abstract>
