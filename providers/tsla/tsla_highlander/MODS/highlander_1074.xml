  <abstract>A newspaper clipping from the "Daily Worker" newspaper featuring the poem "August 19 (A Poem for Clarence Norris)," written by Langston Hughes, and an original copy of the poem typed on the back of Tennessee Valley Authority letterhead.</abstract>
  <abstract>Langston Hughes penned "August 19 (A Poem for Clarence Norris)" to highlight the injustice in the case of the Scottsboro Boys. The Scottsboro Boys were an exemplary case of the Jim Crow legal system in the South where a group of 9 African American teenagers were falsely accused of rape by two white women. The story includes lynch mobs, rushed trials, and all-white juries resulting in death sentences for eight of the defendants. The Supreme Court overturned the death penalties becasue of the all-white juries, however all but four were convicted again for the incident. Hughes wrote this from Clarence Norris's perspective, sitting in prison awaiting his execution, scheduled for August 19, 1938. The Daily Worker was an American Communist newspaper printed from 1924-1958.</abstract>
