  <abstract>Booklet of Marion A. Wright's address to Highlander Folk School. In his speech, Wright attacked segregationists for labeling "left-wingers" as Communists as Pravda, the state paper of the Soviet Union, uses their words and deeds to justify Soviet transgressions. He called their activities "grist for the Communist mill." He also lambasted critics of Highlander for their opposition to free speech, one of Wright's lifelong crusades. He remarked on the irony of certain segregationists' disapproval for school bombings such as the one in Clinton, Tennessee, yet the destruction of the states' school systems from the inside goes unremarked upon. He maintained that Communists and Fascists alike play off the people's fear of an "other" - kulaks in Russia, Jews in Germany, and in the South it was "the Negro."</abstract>
