<dc:title>We the WPA Workers</dc:title>
<dc:description>Program of play "presented by People of Summerfield" in favor of WPA union action. The play consists of thirteen scenes such as "The Union Is on Top," "No More Beans," "Democracy Must Be Defended" and "Strike for Jobs!"</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Summerfield Cooperative was established by seven members of the Summerfield community in Grundy County to clothe local school children in the winter months. They eventually became affiliated with the local Farmers' Union but were never large enough to be self-sustaining and relied on Highlander's support. They still contributed to the community through sewing and canning projects but were overshadowed by larger organizations.</dc:description>
