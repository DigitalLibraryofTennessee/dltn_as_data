<dc:title>Highlander Folk School charter of incorporation</dc:title>
<dc:description>1932 charter of incorporation for the Highlander Folk School. Applied for by Myles Horton, Elizabeth Day "Zilla" Hawes, James Dombrowski, Malcolm Chisholm, and Rupert Hampton.</dc:description>
<dc:description>These five charter members represent the beginning of Highlander Folk School. Highlander had a rough beginning, with only one student at its opening session. But Horton and Don West catered their curriculum to the community's needs and eventually the school gained a foothold after their success in the local bugwood cutters strike in 1933 to 1934. The school was unsuccessful in securing grants from the state and federal government and relied almost entirely on donations as tuition only covered the students' living expenses for the term. It really was not until 1937 when Highlander was granted tax-exempt status that Highlander's monetary woes diminished.</dc:description>
