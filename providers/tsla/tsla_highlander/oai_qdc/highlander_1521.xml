<dc:title>1950 Residence Program</dc:title>
<dc:description>List of workshops for the year 1950, noting that "the bar against Northern students has been lifted in keeping with Highlander's non-discrimination policy." Three workshops "open to Non-Southerners" are a film center workshop, a workshop on the South, and a square dance workshop. This program also includes future plans such as international education and an interracial and interreligious children's camp.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Highlander Folk School was established in 1932, by Myles Horton, Don West, Jim Dombrowski, and others to train and organize Southern laborers. Horton's inspiration came from Reinhold Niebuhr, one of his professors at Union Theological Seminary, a proponent of Christian Socialism. Horton visited a number of Danish Folk Schools and decided to establish one in his home state of Tennessee. The school was founded on land donated by Dr. Lillian Johnson in Monteagle, Tennessee. The 1930s and 1940s saw Highlander train textile and industrial workers as well as union organizers across the South as an arm of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). In the 1950s, Highlander shifted its focus to Civil Rights and school integration. Between 1953 and 1961, Highlander conducted workshops for organizations such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), and the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Staff, including Septima Clark and Bernice Robinson, held workshops to train organizers and held citizenship courses to help African Americans pass onerous literacy tests in order to vote. They eventually trained teachers to expand their network across the South. Their focus on integration brought unwanted attention from red-baiting, segregationist Southern state governments who investigated and eventually shuttered the school in 1961. Highlander was reopened the next day in Knoxville as the Highlander Research and Education Center in Knoxville, Tennessee. It moved to its current home in New Market in 1972. From the 1970s through the 1990s, Highlander worked to support the people of Appalachia defending its landscape and people from destructive environmental and labor practices. Highlander has continued its mission to advocate for worker's rights as well as human rights to this day.</dc:description>
