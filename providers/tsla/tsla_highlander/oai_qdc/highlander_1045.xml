<dc:title>We Build for the Future</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pamphlet with a history of the Summerfield Cooperative "compiled from different stories by its members." At the end, there are ads for "original handmade articles" from the co-op.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Summerfield Cooperative was established by seven members of the Summerfield community in Grundy County to clothe local school children in the winter months. They eventually became affiliated with the local Farmers' Union but were never large enough to be self-sustaining and relied on Highlander's support. They still contributed to the community through sewing and canning projects but were overshadowed by larger organizations.</dc:description>
