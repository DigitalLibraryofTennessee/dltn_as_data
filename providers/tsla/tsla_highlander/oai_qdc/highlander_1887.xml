<dc:title>May Justus singing "What'll We Do With the Baby O'"</dc:title>
<dc:description>May Justus singing "What'll We do With the Baby O," a traditional folk song Justus learned in her youth in Cocke County, Tennessee.</dc:description>
<dc:description>May Justus was a teacher and children's book author from Tennessee. She was born in Del Rio, Tennessee, in 1898. She graduated from the University of Tennessee and published her first book in 1925. Most of her books were set in Appalachia, telling stories of the people and culture of East Tennessee. Justus was persuaded by Dr. Lillian Johnson to help run Summerfield School in Grundy County. In 1932, Myles Horton and Don West took over Summerfield School and opened Highlander Folk School in its place, and Justus left to teach at a local public school. Horton eventually persuaded Justus to return on a volunteer basis, where she served as secretary-treasurer until the school was closed by the state in 1961. At Highlander she became close friends with Septima Clark. Justus published over 60 books in her lifetime, centered on Appalachian folklore, culture, and people. She died on November 7, 1989.</dc:description>
