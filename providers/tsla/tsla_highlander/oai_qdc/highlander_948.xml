<dc:title>Highlander Songbook-1940, Spring Term</dc:title>
<dc:description>An original songbook titled "Songs of Field and Factory" published by the Highlander Folk School. It contains the lyrics to thirty-four labor songs and twenty folk songs.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Highlander taught songs and published songbooks to both educate workers and spread enthusiasm for their cause while picketing or protesting. Zilphia Horton, Highlander's drama and musical director from the 1930s until her death in 1956, traveled to rural areas collecting folk songs which she would rework into union and protest songs. She also taught inspirational music to those protesting and organizing against segregation and racism in the South, often credited with arranging and turning the song "We Shall Overcome" into a Civil Rights anthem.</dc:description>
