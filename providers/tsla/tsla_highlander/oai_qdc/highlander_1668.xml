<dc:title>Letter from E. W. McMillan to Gov. Prentice Cooper</dc:title>
<dc:description>Typewritten letter on Richmond Hosiery Mills letterhead from E. W. McMillan to Governor Prentice Cooper. McMillan states that he and his fellow Legionnaires in Chattanooga have kept close watch on Highlander. Even despite Highlander's denial of Communist ties, McMillan and his friends had apparently been keeping tabs on who attends local Communist meetings in Chattanooga from Highlander and accuses Highlander of being the "headquarters for this Communist crowd." The only evidence McMillan cited in his letter is that Black and white Tennesseans "mixed very freely and had their meals together at the same tables." He named Earl Welch and Ralph Tefferteller as ringleaders of the "so-called school" and Communist training ground. McMillan closed his letter by offering his assistance to Gov. Cooper in closing the school.</dc:description>
