<dc:description>Bernice Robinson on Sea Islands literacy and birth of citizenship schools.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Bernice Robinson was born in 1914 in Charleston, South Carolina. After finding success running a beauty shop, Robinson joined the Charleston chapter of the NAACP. After attending a United Nations workshop on school desegregation, she, Esaue Jenkins, and Septima Clark organized and established literacy school for the people of John's Island. After some training at Highlander, Robinson, Jenkins, and Clark ran citizenship schools in South Carolina and across the South. These were instructional programs both at Highlander and in the community to teach primarily poor African Americans to read, write, pass voter registration tests, and how to take advantage of community institutions such as banks and post offices. These classes helped over 50,000 people register to vote by 1964.</dc:description>
