<dc:title>Letters from W.A. Swift to Gov. Clement</dc:title>
<dc:description>Letters with memo from Glen Nicely. Letters from W. A. Swift to Governor Frank Clement. In his first letter, dated December 7, 1953, Swift calls Highlander a "hot bed of communism." He states that an F.B.I. agent from Chattanooga investigated the school about a month ago. Swift then speculates on the amount of mail they receive and stamps they purchase and reiterates his belief that "they are teaching communism there." Swift's second letter, dated December 10, 1953, Swift claims that Highlander "has all the ear-marks of a communist center" and that "communism is now the outstanding danger to America and Christianity." A number of memoranda to and from government officials and the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation regarding the correspondence and investigations into Highlander Folk School.</dc:description>
<dc:description>W. A. Swift was a Methodist preacher in Monteagle, Tennessee. Swift, an ardent opponent of Highlander, wrote several times to Governor Clement with accusations of Communist activity at Highlander and many conspiracy theories of their spying on various churches in the area. Swift even wrote directly to J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the FBI, accusing them of Communist activity because of the amount of mail they received. The special-agent-in-charge in Knoxville interviewed Swift in August 1953 regarding these accusations.</dc:description>
