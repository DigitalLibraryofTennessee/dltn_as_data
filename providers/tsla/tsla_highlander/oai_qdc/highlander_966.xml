<dc:title>Handwritten Song with Musical Notation</dc:title>
<dc:description>The words and music to a song, handwritten in pencil by Zilphia, on the reverse side of that appears to be a page from a play or operetta.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Highlander taught songs and published songbooks to both educate workers and spread enthusiasm for their cause while picketing or protesting. Zilphia Horton, Highlander's drama and musical director from the 1930s until her death in 1956, traveled to rural areas collecting folk songs which she would rework into union and protest songs. She also taught inspirational music to those protesting and organizing against segregation and racism in the South, often credited with arranging and turning the song "We Shall Overcome" into a Civil Rights anthem.</dc:description>
