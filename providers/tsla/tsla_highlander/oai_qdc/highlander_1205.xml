<dc:title>Organizations Designated Under Executive Order No. 10450</dc:title>
<dc:description>List of organizations designated under Executive Order No. 10450. Members of these organizations could be barred from federal service. Many of these organizations are either affiliated with labor movements, pacifism, immigrant societies, or desegregation.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Executive Order No. 10450, issued by President Eisenhower, repealed Executive Order 9835 and dismantled its loyalty review board. This order explanded security criteria for certain government jobs, changed criteria for employment from a loyalty test to a character test, and outlawed any gay or lesbian employees from all federal governmental positions as part of the "Lavender Scare." Parts of this order were repealed in 1975, 1977, and 1998, but the full order was not repealed until President Obama in 2017, the last of his administration.</dc:description>
