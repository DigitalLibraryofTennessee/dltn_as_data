<dc:title>Highlander Folk School article from New World Commentator</dc:title>
<dc:description>Article detailing Highlander Folk School's history and mission. Includes "the Program at Highlander" written by Myles Horton which outlines educational programs offered at Highlander as well as its mission and purpose.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Myles Horton was born in Savannah, Tennessee, in 1905, to Perry Horton and Elsie Falls Horton. Myles supported his high school education by working at a sawmill and box factory. He graduated from Cumberland University then attended Union Theological Seminary and the University of Chicago. At Union, he studied under Reinhold Niebuhr, who he agreed with on worker&#65533;s rights, education, and the rejection of corporate capitalism. In 1931, Horton travelled to Denmark to tour the country&#65533;s folk schools, on which he would base Highlander. Horton&#65533;s objective was for those &#65533;who would otherwise have no educational advantages&#65533; to learn enough about themselves and society, to have something on which to base their decisions and actions whether in their own community or in an industrial situation&#65533;&#65533; Horton, Don West, Jim Dombrowski, and others established Highlander Folk School in 1932, in Monteagle, Tennessee. He met his wife, Zilphia Mae Johnson at a workshop there and the pair married in 1935. They had two children, Charis and Thorsten, before Zilphia&#65533;s death in 1956. In 1961, Myles married Aimee Isgrig, but they later separated. Horton died in 1990 at the age of 84. Horton&#65533;s role in the Civil Rights movement is often undervalued, but early organization of boycotts, marches, and voter education courses occurred at Highlander under the eye of Myles Horton.</dc:description>
