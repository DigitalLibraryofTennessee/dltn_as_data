  <abstract>Federal officers, a regimental band with instruments, and several ladies pose in front of the two-story Aldehoff School. People can be seen in the windows of the building, and a tent appears in the right foreground of the dual-image stereograph card, a possible indication that Union forces are occupying the premises.</abstract>
  <abstract>After coming to Chattanooga in 1850 and opening schools at several different locations, Henry W. von Aldehoff purchased the McCullough Hotel property on Lookout Mountain in order to operate a school large enough for boarding pupils. After the firing on Fort Sumter, school pupils lit barrels of coal tar, made secessionist speeches and sang. Boys and girls left the Institute to aid the war effort, and the school closed.</abstract>
