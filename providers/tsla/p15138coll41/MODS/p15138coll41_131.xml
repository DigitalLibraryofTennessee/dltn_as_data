  <abstract>A photograph on the Harahan Bridge, also known as the "Great Bridge," in Memphis, Tennessee. A locomotive is crossing the bridge. A man with luggage stands to the side of the tracks.</abstract>
  <abstract>Railroads were a major contributing factor in altering the population in the South. Cheap and easy transportation, railroads allowed many African Americans to move out of the South and many whites to move into it. The railroads and immigration agencies made organized efforts to supply white labor, which was increasingly in demand. The ratio of white population increased in the Southern States through births and white immigration. Later, efforts were made at limiting railroad access for African Americans in order to stem migration.</abstract>
