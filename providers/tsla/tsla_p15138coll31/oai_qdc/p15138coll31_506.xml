<dc:description>The Hostess and Hospital Service and Recreation corps was founded by the American Red Cross in 1918 at Walter Reed Army Hospital. Although the corps&#8217; volunteers underwent rigorous training by medical professionals in areas of hospital organization, ethics, psychiatry and occupational therapy, they provided non-medical care, acting as hostesses and providing recreational services to patients. In 1947, the name of the corps was officially changed to the Gray Lady service &#8211; a nod to their distinguishable gray uniforms with white collars and cuffs. Due to high demand for their services during and after the Great Depression, the corps&#8217; expanded to other military and civilian hospitals and blood centers and also provided assistance with disaster response. The Gray Ladies' service peaked after World War II. In the mid-1960s, the Red Cross ended its Gray Lady Service, and the volunteer uniforms were changed to a universal blue.</dc:description>
