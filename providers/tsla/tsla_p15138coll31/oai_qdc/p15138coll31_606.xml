<dc:title>Letter from Marian Clements to Margaret Croft</dc:title>
<dc:description>Letter from Marian Clements to Margaret Croft expressing her concern that the Lookout Shop is "now not very interested in crafts." Marian mentions Margaret opening her own craft shop in the fall, and says she would be happy to send some of her work when that happens, as "I would rather send my work to craft places than to general gift shops."</dc:description>
<dc:description>Margaret Croft owned part of the Lookout Shop and was involved in its day-to-day business affairs until she sold her shares in 1945. This letter is written just a few months before she sold her shares. It does not appear that she went foward with her idea of opening her own craft shop. The Lookout Show was opened by Arlene Ziegler and Mabel Ward in 1939 as a store featuring arts and crafts from Southern artists. The pair sold the shop when they retired in 1953. Ward and Ziegler were also the founders of Nashville's iconic Satsuma Tea Room, which operated from 1918-2001. </dc:description>
