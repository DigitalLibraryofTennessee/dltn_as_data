<dc:title>Letter from Howard Kester to Margaret Croft</dc:title>
<dc:description>Letter to Margaret Croft from Howard Kester of the Penn Normal Industrial and Agricultural School, in response to Margaret's letter asking to sell crafts from the school in the Lookout Shop. Mr. Kester writes that there is a shortage of workers and do not have any products at the moment, but would be happy in the future to "market some of our goods there."</dc:description>
<dc:description>Penn Normal Industrial and Agricultural School on St. Helena Island, South Carolina, was started in 1862 as part of the Port Royal Experiment with the goal to educate previously enslaved African Americans and to help with the transition out of slavery. The Industrial and Agricultural Schools were developed in 1901 and classes on basket making, midwifery, carpentry, and more were added to the curriculum. Howard Anderson Kester, a prominent figure in social justice causes, and his wife began working at the school in 1943 as principal and director of instruction and left in 1948 when the Penn School became a community agency. </dc:description>
