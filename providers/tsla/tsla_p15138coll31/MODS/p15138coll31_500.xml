  <abstract>Hand-tinted photograph of the second Croft home in Cuba. This home was located at the corner of 19 and F Streets in Vedado, Havana. The entry gate has two statues of women on top. The Crofts had both statues shipped to Grassmere, but one broke during shipment. The surviving statue is currently at Grassmere.</abstract>
  <abstract>The Crofts lived in two homes in Cuba, both in Vedado, a neighborhood populated by Americans and diplomats from around the globe. Their first home was located at 26 F Street, and they later moved to their second home on the corner of 19 and F Streets. It was this second home that was confiscated by the Cuban Government in 1961.</abstract>
