  <abstract>Dallas writes Elise to inform her of his new job with the Rust Engineering Company after leaving Cuba. He includes news of the Croft companies in Cuba, which were confiscated and were being run by some of the company's old workers. He tells her of the company's office manager, Herman Koch, who left the country after his son was killed. He discusses possible ways to get some of their losses recouped from the U.S. Government or through selling equipment not in Cuba to other companies.</abstract>
  <abstract>Bradford B. Dallas (b. 1924) is the son of Charles Frederick Dallas, who was owner of the Antillean Construction Company based in Havana. Bradford managed his father's company and William Croft's General Concrete Construction Company of Cuba until he was forced to leave the country in 1961.</abstract>
