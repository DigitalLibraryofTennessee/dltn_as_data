  <abstract>William Croft (1860-1938) married Kate Carney Shute (1865-1925) on October 17, 1888, at Grassmere. They had two daughters, Margaret (1889-1974) and Elise (1894-1985). In 1900, William moved to Havana, Cuba, to set up business. In 1902, he moved his family to Cuba, with Kate and the girls returning to Nashville during the summers. He owned the General Concrete Construction Company of Cuba, which specialized in building concrete chimneys for the sugar industry, until his death. Mr. Croft died of a heart attack in the Bank of Nova Scotia in Havana on March 4, 1938.</abstract>
