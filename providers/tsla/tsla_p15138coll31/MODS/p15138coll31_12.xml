  <abstract>Small postcard from The Lookout Shop located at 520 Union Street in Nashville. The Lookout Shop specialized in Southern handmade arts and crafts, including weaving, pottery, glass, metalwork, furniture, basketry, and brooms.</abstract>
  <abstract>Margaret Croft owned part of the Lookout Shop and was involved in its day-to-day business affairs until she sold her shares in 1945. The shop was opened by Arlene Ziegler and Mable Ward in 1939 as a store featuring arts and crafts from Southern artists. The pair sold the shop when they retired in 1953. Ward and Ziegler were also the founders of Nashville's iconic Satsuma Tea Room, which operated from 1918-2001.</abstract>
