  <abstract>Resolution between Margaret and Elise Croft and Nashville Children's Museum Association. The deed requires Nashville Children's Museum Association to pay taxes assessed against the Grassmere property beginning in the year 1964. The deed also requires operation of an educational nature study program under the name "Grassmere Nature Study Center."</abstract>
  <abstract>In 1964, Margaret and Elise Croft donated the Grassmere property to the Children's Museum of Nashville to be used as a "nature study center." As part of the agreement, the sisters would live on the property until their deaths and the Museum would pay taxes and maintain the property. Margaret passed away in 1974. After Elise's death in 1985, the Museum developed Grassmere Wildlife Park on the property, which opened in 1990 and closed in 1995. In 1996, the Nashville Zoo moved from Joelton to Grassmere where it remains to this day.</abstract>
