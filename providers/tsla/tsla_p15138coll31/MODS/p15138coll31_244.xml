  <abstract>Two page typed letter from the Children's Museum of Nashville to Margaret and Elise Croft, dated February 2, 1962. Letter is written to confirm and detail the acquisition of the Croft's property, approximately 300 acres on Nolensville Road, by the Children's Museum.</abstract>
  <abstract>In 1964, Margaret and Elise Croft donated the Grassmere property to the Children's Museum of Nashville to be used as a "nature study center." As part of the agreement, the sisters would live on the property until their deaths and the Museum would pay taxes and maintain the property. Margaret passed away in 1974. After Elise's death in 1985, the Museum developed Grassmere Wildlife Park on the property, which opened in 1990 and closed in 1995. In 1996, the Nashville Zoo moved from Joelton to Grassmere where it remains to this day.</abstract>
