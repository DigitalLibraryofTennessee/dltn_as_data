  <abstract>The Hostess and Hospital Service and Recreation corps was founded by the American Red Cross in 1918 at Walter Reed Army Hospital. Although the corps’ volunteers underwent rigorous training by medical professionals in areas of hospital organization, ethics, psychiatry and occupational therapy, they provided non-medical care, acting as hostesses and providing recreational services to patients. In 1947, the name of the corps was officially changed to the Gray Lady service – a nod to their distinguishable gray uniforms with white collars and cuffs. Due to high demand for their services during and after the Great Depression, the corps’ expanded to other military and civilian hospitals and blood centers and also provided assistance with disaster response. The Gray Ladies' service peaked after World War II. In the mid-1960s, the Red Cross ended its Gray Lady Service, and the volunteer uniforms were changed to a universal blue.</abstract>
