  <abstract>In a letter to Marie Murphy of the Foreign Claims Commission, Elise Croft lists the personal property located in the Croft home in Havana, Cuba, when it was seized by the Cuban government. The Croft sisters used this information to file a claim against Cuba for missing property. The inventory includes a great deal of mahogany furniture, including a dining table originally in the Spanish government's palace. This "practice letter" is written on both sides of a letter from the Tennessee Hospital Service Association. Elise would often write out her letters on scrap paper before rewriting them and sending a final version.</abstract>
  <abstract>William Croft moved to Cuba in 1900 and started the General Concrete Construction Company of Cuba in Havana. The company specialized in the construction of concrete chimneys for the sugar industry on the island. After Mr. Croft’s death in 1938, his daughters Elise and Margaret became sole owners of the company’s stocks and relied on income from the company for their livelihood. Elise visited Cuba at least once a year on business through the 1950s and kept up a regular correspondence with company manager Bradford Dallas. On December 6, 1961, all of the Crofts’ property in Cuba, including the company, was confiscated pursuant to Law 989 - the abandoned property law issued by Fidel Castro (1926-2016). The Croft sisters filed a claim with the United States Government in the late 1960s, but never received compensation for their losses. Their claims against the Cuban government are still outstanding.</abstract>
