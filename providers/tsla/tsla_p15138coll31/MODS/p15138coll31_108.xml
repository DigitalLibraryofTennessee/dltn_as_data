  <abstract>Document written in 1930 by Elise Croft, regarding her wishes after death. She leaves items to her friends, family and some of the house staff in Cuba. She states that if they still own Grassmere when she dies, she bequeaths it to the state of Tennessee, "to be forever used as a park, kept as a natural one." She also states that if she still owns the family house at 19 and F streets in Cuba, she will give that to "the Cuban government to be used as a park... preserving all that would be possible of its trees and shrubs." She also states that her diaries and letters be burnt unread.</abstract>
  <abstract>In 1964, Margaret and Elise Croft donated the Grassmere property to the Children's Museum of Nashville to be used as a "nature study center." As part of the agreement, the sisters would live on the property until their deaths and the Museum would pay taxes and maintain the property. Margaret passed away in 1974. After Elise's death in 1985, the Museum developed Grassmere Wildlife Park on the property, which opened in 1990 and closed in 1995. In 1996, the Nashville Zoo moved from Joelton to Grassmere where it remains to this day.</abstract>
