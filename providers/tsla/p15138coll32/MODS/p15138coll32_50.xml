  <abstract>On the left is a soldier named Rocky. The soldier on the right is unknown. This is the Chorwon Valley, the first place that Brock's company was stationed. There are weapons at the corner of the squad tent again--machine gun, bazooka, and a box of ammunition.</abstract>
  <abstract>Despite countless examples of brave and devoted military service throughout American history, African Americans continued to face discrimination and segregation in the ranks of the U.S. military on the eve of the Korean War. The battlefield pressure of the Korean War would become the catalyst for the full implementation of President Harry S. Truman's Executive Order 9981 that provided for the desegregation of the United States armed forces. Issued in July of 1948, the order set up a presidential oversight commission to work with the military on plans to integrate the branches of service, but black soldiers still served in racially segregated units with virtually all white senior officers when the conflict began in June of 1950. Bloodletting on the battlefields of Korea opened the door for the desegregation of the military. Replacement soldiers were urgently needed in the early days, regardless of the color of their skin. Commander in Chief of the Far East Command General Matthew B. Ridgway began the total integration of U.S. Army combat units in Korea in the late summer and fall of 1951. As of October of 1951, black units were officially closed out, and the average U.S. Army unit became composed of 12% African American soldiers. In Brock's case, his military training program and housing at Fort Leonard Wood were racially integrated, as would be the squad tents of his combat engineer company, with black and white soldiers sleeping, eating, working, and relaxing together. By July of 1953, over 90% of black soldiers were serving in integrated units. An estimated 600,000 African Americans served in the armed forces during the Korean War; roughly 9.3% of Americans killed in Korea were African American. The U.S. Army announced in 1954 that all its units were finally fully integrated. At war's end, African Americans had distinguished themselves with numerous awards derived from courage displayed on the ground and in the air. Though future battles remained regarding discrimination in the military with assignments, promotions, and military justice, African American Korean War soldiers had exhibited their leadership in command positions and showcased their abilities to serve admirably in elite and technical specialty units during the course of the war. Hispanic Americans also had a history of distinguishing themselves in combat in American history, as well as a history of continued discrimination and prejudice exhibited toward them in the armed forces. Over the course of the Korean War, nearly 148,000 Hispanic Americans volunteered or were drafted into military service, many fighting with the legendary Third Infantry Division's 65th Infantry Regiment "The Borinqueneers." Nine Hispanic Americans received the Congressional Medal of Honor for their displays of heroism during the Korean War.</abstract>
