  <abstract>Soldiers are seen on a bench in the waiting area of the airport apron. One soldier reads a newspaper, while another lies on the bench with his head completely covered. Locations for the gathering of specific personnel are designated by "packet" signs. Several airplanes appear in the background of the image. This is the Korean military air base where Brock and Connors left and returned to Korea with their Tokyo R&amp;R. The United Nations Far East Air Force used fifteen air bases in Japan for combat support over the course of the war, and built or improved fifty-five airfields in Korea.</abstract>
  <abstract>Brock's experience of Rest and Recuperation (R&amp;R) was shared by more than 800,000 American soldiers in the Korean War. Inaugurated in early 1951, this morale-boosting military program allowed American soldiers and marines to earn five days of leave in a Japanese city for every 180 days of active duty, regardless of rank. The genesis of this program lay in World War II studies that indicated casualty rates increase dramatically past 180 consecutive days of combat service. Three processing centers (Tokyo, Osaka, and Kokura) received military personnel arriving by air and sea, and generally supplied them with dress uniforms, pay, and accommodations. R&amp;R official quarters might be on military bases, at military Special Services hotels, or at Civil Service hotels that prioritized the military. Unofficially, however, soldiers might seek out private Japanese inns and hotels. American soldiers interacted with the Japanese in bars, clubs, hotels, and in the streets of cities like Tokyo. R&amp;R experiences allowed for not only a respite from the stresses of war, but also helped cement American post-World War II reconciliation with the Japanese people.</abstract>
