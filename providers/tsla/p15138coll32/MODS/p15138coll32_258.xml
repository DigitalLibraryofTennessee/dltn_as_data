  <abstract>Black lacquer cover that housed the second David Franklin Brock Korean War photograph album displays a map of Japan featuring major cities. The outline of Japan is flanked by typical images associated with the country, such as a rickshaw and a tea house or pagoda. Brock obtained this album at the port city of Yokohama, where American soldiers spent a week being oriented and equipped before sailing for Korea. The soldiers were not allowed off the base, but this military installation had an attached shopping facility staffed by Japanese civilians paid to man the stores. Soldiers were instructed not to tip these workers. The stores contained both common and fine items, like silver. Japanese citizens were also hired to package soldiers' purchases and ship the items back to America. Brock purchased multiple photo albums and had them shipped home to his mother in Van Buren County. He believes that he assembled this second album for his mother after he married and presented it to her. Likely, near the time of her death, she gave it back to him.</abstract>
  <abstract>At the age of twenty, David Franklin Brock, a farm boy from Van Buren County, had only been out of the state of Tennessee once in his life before his country called him a world away.  Brock served from January of 1952 to October of 1953 in the Korean War.  He trained at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri.  He attained the rank of corporal as a combat engineer with the Second Infantry Division, the famed Indianhead Division—“Second to None.” His unit built roads, bridges, and bunkers for the front while often under enemy fire.  As a demolitions specialist, he detonated explosives and laid and cleared mines.  As with all combat engineers, he was trained in combat infantry, and, when needed, functioned as an infantry soldier.  During his tour of duty, he was stationed in Korea’s Chorwon Valley, Kumhwa region, and at the Hook. Brock came home on active reserve to his sweetheart, Laura Mae Phillips.  They married in 1954 and made their home in Sparta, Tennessee.  In June of 1966, they were blessed with twin daughters, Darla and Karla. Brock is a longtime faithful member of the Findlay United Methodist Church.  After thirty-five years of devoted service, he retired from Mallory Controls in Sparta.</abstract>
