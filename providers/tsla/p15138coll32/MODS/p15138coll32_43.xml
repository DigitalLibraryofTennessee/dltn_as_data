  <abstract>Ohio soldier Carl Langley stands in front of the squad's tent straddling a rocket launcher at the Chorwon Valley base camp. Langley was in Brock's company but not his squad. Langley was in a vehicle accident where he was deemed criminally at fault and was given the choice of prison or the military. Langley didn't write home, and his parents contacted the Red Cross. The company commander ordered Langley to write a letter home every week and bring to the commander to mail.</abstract>
  <abstract>An option American judges occasionally offered to the convicted in the Korean War era was joining the military in lieu of incarceration. President Harry S. Truman's Executive Order 3000 provided service incentive for lawbreakers, as well. The order, issued in December of 1952, granted a full pardon to anyone convicted of violating any U.S. law who served in the military for at least one year and was honorably discharged.</abstract>
