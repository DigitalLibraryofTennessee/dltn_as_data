  <abstract>This is a safe civilian population likely near the 2nd Division Orphanage. This village would not be located within twenty miles of the front. A Korean civilian male appears in the foreground of the image.</abstract>
  <abstract>At the age of twenty, David Franklin Brock, a farm boy from Van Buren County, had only been out of the state of Tennessee once in his life before his country called him a world away. Brock served from January of 1952 to October of 1953 in the Korean War. He trained at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. He attained the rank of corporal as a combat engineer with the Second Infantry Division, the famed Indianhead Division Second to None. His unit built roads, bridges, and bunkers for the front while often under enemy fire. As a demolitions specialist, he detonated explosives and laid and cleared mines. As with all combat engineers, he was trained in combat infantry, and, when needed, functioned as an infantry soldier. During his tour of duty, he was stationed in Korea's Chorwon Valley, Kumhwa region, and at the Hook. Brock came home on active reserve to his sweetheart, Laura Mae Phillips. They married in 1954 and made their home in Sparta, Tennessee. In June of 1966, they were blessed with twin daughters, Darla and Karla. Brock is a longtime faithful member of the Findlay United Methodist Church. After thirty-five years of devoted service, he retired from Mallory Controls in Sparta.</abstract>
