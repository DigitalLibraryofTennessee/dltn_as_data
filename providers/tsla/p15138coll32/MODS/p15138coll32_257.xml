  <abstract>Brock is pictured in the gardens of his Tokyo Civil Service Hotel while on leave. He stands on a structure located at the back of the hotel built to resemble a boat.</abstract>
  <abstract>Brock's experience of Rest and Recuperation (R&amp;R) was shared by more than 800,000 American soldiers in the Korean War. Inaugurated in early 1951, this morale-boosting military program allowed American soldiers and marines to earn five days of leave in a Japanese city for every 180 days of active duty, regardless of rank. The genesis of this program lay in World War II studies that indicated casualty rates increase dramatically past 180 consecutive days of combat service. Three processing centers (Tokyo, Osaka, and Kokura) received military personnel arriving by air and sea, and generally supplied them with dress uniforms, pay, and accommodations. R&amp;R official quarters might be on military bases, at military Special Services hotels, or at Civil Service hotels that prioritized the military. Unofficially, however, soldiers might seek out private Japanese inns and hotels. American soldiers interacted with the Japanese in bars, clubs, hotels, and in the streets of cities like Tokyo. R&amp;R experiences allowed for not only a respite from the stresses of war, but also helped cement American post-World War II reconciliation with the Japanese people.</abstract>
