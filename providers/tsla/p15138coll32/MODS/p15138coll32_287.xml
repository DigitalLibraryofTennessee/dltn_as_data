  <abstract>Exterior shot of Phillips holding two bunches of freshly gathered wild honeysuckle at the Brock family farm in Van Buren County. David Franklin Brock would have taken this photograph while on leave from his engineer training at Fort Leonard Wood.</abstract>
  <abstract>Born in 1933 into a family of Tennessee sharecroppers at the height of the Great Depression, Laura Mae Phillips experienced sacrifice and hardship early in life. Phillips captured the attention of David Franklin Brock when they were teenagers, and he was immediately smitten. The two were sweethearts throughout the course of his service in the Korean War. Phillips's combined fear of commitment and delight in playing hard to get, however, led to her absenting herself several times when Brock came home on leave from training at Fort Leonard Wood and to her heading north for work in a Detroit spark plug factory while Brock was overseas. When Brock returned stateside in 1953, he renewed his courtship of Phillips, and they married in 1954.</abstract>
