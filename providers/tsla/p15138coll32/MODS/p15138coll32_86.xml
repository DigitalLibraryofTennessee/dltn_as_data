  <abstract>Brock's company is moving back toward the front. They finished in the Chorwon Valley, have spent 30 days in reserve, and are now moving up to Kumhwa. Soldiers are pictured standing next to jeeps and trailers on the road. Items being loaded or unloaded appear in the foreground.</abstract>
  <abstract>In the Korean War, combat engineer units rotated toward the front, often attached to combat infantry regiments to provide support. After extended periods of service near the front, units would be rotated to the rear, perhaps twenty-five miles from the lines, and placed in reserve for approximately thirty days for rest, additional training and equipping, and possible secondary missions. Combat engineers in particular seemed charged with continuing their construction and maintenance assignments while in reserve. The 2nd Engineers spent most of January of 1953 in reserve; the battalion also moved its companies through reserve during April, May, and most of June of 1953. During both periods of reserve, the 2nd Engineers rehabilitated their vehicles and equipment and received training in engineer and infantry tactics.</abstract>
