  <abstract>While taking a break from road work, Brock and his South Korean fellow squad member (same tent &amp; same mission) Le Bon Duc engage in horseplay.</abstract>
  <abstract>August 15, 1950 saw the agreement of the government of the Republic of Korea and the United Nations Command to place as many as one hundred South Korean soldiers in each U.S. company-sized unit of the Eighth Army, as an augmentation; thus, the KATUSA (Korean Augmentation to the U.S. Army) program was born. The Korean soldiers received basic training and then were assigned to American units to provide additional fire power. Though still legally under the Republic of Korea Army and under the administration of the Republic of Korea government, these soldiers were fed and equipped by the Eighth Army. In addition to introducing cultural and linguistic challenges into the ranks, according to Brock, the presence of the KATUSAs required other adjustments to be made; the M-1 rifle proved too large for the Korean soldiers, and instead they carried the older carbines. In some cases, as in Brock's company, the KATUSAs were integrated into the squads, thereby, sleeping, eating, and undertaking missions with American troops. In other cases, separate Korean platoons were formed. The 2nd Division placed the KATUSA personnel largely in infantry regiments and Division artillery, to function as riflemen, ammunition bearers, cannoneers, and the like. The KATUSAs, once seasoned, performed admirably. The French and Netherlands Battalions attached to the 2nd Infantry Division widely utilized these Korean soldiers. July of 1952 found further authorization for increasing the strength of the KATUSAs in the Eighth Army. At war's end, approximately 27,000 KATUSAs were serving alongside American soldiers. Today, they remain attached to the 2nd Division stationed in South Korea, and the value of their service is reflected in the current official designation of the Division: U.S. Army Second Infantry Division/ROK-US Combined Division.</abstract>
