  <abstract>Photograph of David Franklin Brock with his girlfriend, whom he later married, Laura Mae Phillips. This image was taken when Brock was home on a thirty-day leave after he had completed his military engineering training at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, and before he was shipped out to Korea. He has his engineer pin on his khaki uniform. The photo was made in Sparta by local photographer Frank England.</abstract>
  <abstract>Born in 1933 into a family of Tennessee sharecroppers at the height of the Great Depression, Laura Mae Phillips experienced sacrifice and hardship early in life. Phillips captured the attention of David Franklin Brock when they were teenagers, and he was immediately smitten. The two were sweethearts throughout the course of his service in the Korean War. Phillips's combined fear of commitment and delight in playing hard to get, however, led to her absenting herself several times when Brock came home on leave from training at Fort Leonard Wood and to her heading north for work in a Detroit spark plug factory while Brock was overseas. When Brock returned stateside in 1953, he renewed his courtship of Phillips, and they married in 1954.</abstract>
