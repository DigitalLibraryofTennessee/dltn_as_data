  <abstract>This location is in the Division rear, at least twenty miles from the front. Brock's squad is building something for the Division. Here they kept the financial records about allotments sent home by soldiers. This is when Brock was stationed in the Kumhwa district. Only the one squad went on this mission. Usually, Brock's squad got picked to travel, if there was only one squad needed.</abstract>
  <abstract>As a Korean War soldier in the 2nd Infantry Division's 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, Company D attached to the 72nd Tank Battalion, David Franklin Brock built roads, bridges, and bunkers for the front while often under enemy fire. Brock, a demolitions specialist, detonated explosives and laid and cleared land mines. As with all combat engineers, he was trained in combat infantry, and, when needed, functioned as an infantry soldier. Brock's in-theater service occurred in the vicinity of the Iron Triangle and near the 38th parallel. During this time (from July of 1952 to the end of the war), the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion was stationed at the Chorwon Valley, then in the Kumhwa region, and finally at the Hook. Brock'served his country from January 1952 to October 1953 and was promoted to corporal. He came home to Van Buren County on active reserve.</abstract>
