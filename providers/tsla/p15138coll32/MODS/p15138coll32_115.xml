  <abstract>Pictured left to right are Austin, with a cigarette and dog tags visible; Connors with guitar; and Robert L. Borders at the washpan grooming. These are all soldiers in Brock's squad (same tent &amp; same missions). The location is the company's base camp at the Hook, the last place Brock was stationed. At this washstand, men shaved and washed up; there were no showers here. The front is positioned a few miles directly behind these men.</abstract>
  <abstract>Despite countless examples of brave and devoted military service throughout American history, African Americans continued to face discrimination and segregation in the ranks of the U.S. military on the eve of the Korean War. The battlefield pressure of the Korean War would become the catalyst for the full implementation of President Harry S. Truman's Executive Order No. 9981 that provided for the desegregation of the United States armed forces. Issued in July of 1948, the order set up a presidential oversight commission to work with the military on plans to integrate the branches of service, but black soldiers still served in racially segregated units with virtually all white senior officers when the conflict began in June of 1950. Bloodletting on the battlefields of Korea opened the door for the desegregation of the military. Replacement soldiers were urgently needed in the early days, regardless of the color of their skin. Commander in Chief of the Far East Command General Matthew B. Ridgway began the total integration of U.S. Army combat units in Korea in the late summer and fall of 1951. As of October of 1951, black units were officially closed out, and the average U.S. Army unit became composed of 12% African American soldiers. In Brock's case, his military training program and housing at Fort Leonard Wood were racially integrated, as would be the squad tents of his combat engineer company, with black and white soldiers sleeping, eating, working, and relaxing together. By July of 1953, over 90% of black soldiers were serving in integrated units. An estimated 600,000 African Americans served in the armed forces during the Korean War; roughly 9.3% of Americans killed in Korea were African American. The U.S. Army announced in 1954 that all its units were finally fully integrated. At war's end, African Americans had distinguished themselves with numerous awards derived from courage displayed on the ground and in the air. Though future battles remained regarding discrimination in the military with assignments, promotions, and military justice, African American Korean War soldiers had exhibited their leadership in command positions and showcased their abilities to serve admirably in elite and technical specialty units during the course of the war.</abstract>
