  <abstract>After spending long months at the Korean War front, Brock is pictured treating himself to a bath in his Tokyo hotel room while on R&amp;R.</abstract>
  <abstract>While in the field, Army soldiers such as Brock only received a chance for a shower about every two weeks. A group would be taken in an open truck to a shower location at least ten miles from the front. At that point, soldiers left all their dirty clothing with South Koreans who operated the showers and laundry and received clean uniforms of a comparable size that had been left previously by other units. In the interim and depending upon the weather, soldiers would either wash-up in their tents using their helmets to hold water, or utilize an outdoor washstand and basin. Such military fumigation and bath operations were generally set up alongside a body of water and equipped with pumps, boilers, washing machines, and portable showers. Their mission was to support combat troops by offering hot showers and clean clothing. Brock's experience of Rest and Recuperation (R&amp;R) was shared by more than 800,000 American soldiers in the Korean War. Inaugurated in early 1951, this morale-boosting military program allowed American soldiers and marines to earn five days of leave in a Japanese city for every 180 days of active duty, regardless of rank. The genesis of this program lay in World War II studies that indicated casualty rates increase dramatically past 180 consecutive days of combat service. Three processing centers (Tokyo, Osaka, and Kokura) received military personnel arriving by air and sea, and generally supplied them with dress uniforms, pay, and accommodations. R&amp;R official quarters might be on military bases, at military Special Services hotels, or at Civil Service hotels that prioritized the military. Unofficially, however, soldiers might seek out private Japanese inns and hotels. American soldiers interacted with the Japanese in bars, clubs, hotels, and in the streets of cities like Tokyo. R&amp;R experiences allowed for not only a respite from the stresses of war, but also helped cement American post-World War II reconciliation with the Japanese people.</abstract>
