  <abstract>Brock pictured at his company's first station in the Chorwon Valley. Brock is squatting down with a .30 caliber machine gun in front of him and a rocket launcher (bazooka) to his left. Brock's assigned weapon if called into combat was the rocket launcher.</abstract>
  <abstract>Pictured are weapons that fall into the category of small arms. These weapons resided outside the squad tents of the combat engineers to be scooped up by the individual assigned to the particular weapon if he were called upon to function as a combat infantryman. Most of the small arms, individual or crew-served weapons, utilized by Americans or Republic of Korea (ROK) soldiers in the Korean War were U.S. standard issue leftovers from World War II. The light machine gun is a tripod-mounted, belt-fed .30 caliber air-cooled Browning, devoid of shoulder stock (likely the M-1919A4). In the Korean War, the 3.5-inch rocket launcher (bazooka) proved the standard anti-tank weapon; the measurement indicates the diameter of the launching tube. The aluminum bazooka launched a 23-inch long, 8 pound shape-charged rocket capable of piercing the armor of any contemporary tank and detrimental when deployed against enemy fortifications. Delayed in development after World War II, this rocket launcher and its ammunition went into production fifteen days before the start of the Korean War. The weapon was first airlifted to Korea on July 10, 1950. The previously fielded 2.36-inch model had proven ineffective in World War II and bitterly disappointed the infantrymen of Task Force Smith in the early days of the war with its inability to pierce the armor of North Korean T-34 tanks.</abstract>
