  <abstract>Image of the USS General W. A. Mann. Photo was purchased on the ferry boat that took Brock from Camp Stoneman (California) to the San Francisco port; the picture was bought, addressed, and mailed from the ferry boat. Hundreds of people were aboard; the military dependents (wives and children) never came up on deck with the soldiers. The bottom decks were filled with cars. Brock'stayed on deck and ate salty peanuts to counter seasickness.</abstract>
  <abstract>This 622-foot troopship with a maximum wartime capacity of 6,800 troops served with the United States Navy in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. Named for Major General William Abram Mann of the United States Army, the USS General W.A. Mann received her commission on October 13, 1943. She boasts two service stars for the Korean War and one for the Vietnam War. Notably, the USS General W.A. Mann conveyed valuable Republic of Korea government cargo and the private papers of South Korean President Syngman Rhee from Pusan to San Francisco in August of 1950. The Navy decommissioned this troop transport on December 11, 1965.</abstract>
