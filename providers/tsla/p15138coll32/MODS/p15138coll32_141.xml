  <abstract>Connors is on the left; Robert L. Borders is behind a .50 caliber machine gun, and Brock is on the right. There is a squad tent behind them (10-15 men in each squad.). This is the Kumhwa district. Brock, Borders, and Connors are in the same squad (same tent &amp; same missions).</abstract>
  <abstract>Most of the small arms, individual or crew-served weapons, utilized by Americans or Republic of Korea (ROK) soldiers in the Korean War were U.S. standard issue leftovers from World War II. The pictured Korean War era belt-fed Browning .50 caliber air-cooled M-1921M2HB heavy machine gun's history began with its 1921 origin date. Modifications were made to the original water-cooled version in the 1930s to produce an air-cooled Browning M2 still utilizing the huge .50 BMG ( Browning Machine Gun ) bullet-shaped cartridge fed through an ammunition belt. The 84-pound M2HB ( Heavy Barrel ) followed, and allowed the weapon to be fired longer without over-heating. With a range of 2,000 yards, this extremely versatile heavy machine gun became a classic weapon/cartridge combination throughout the world, and in the case of Brock's Korean War usage, provided superior infantry fire support when needed.</abstract>
