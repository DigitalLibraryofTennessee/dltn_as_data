  <abstract>The soldier stands on top of one of the building's ventilators. To his right are the chimney pipes that come out from under the orphanage. The orphanage was built with regular concrete floors, but many homes in Korea at this time had dirt floors. In both cases, to supply heat to the structure, tunnels were dug under the floor (sometimes lined with metal piping that might have been fashioned from melted shell casings). A fire would be lit with pine needles inside the building, and the heat generated would be spread by the ventilators across the structure through the tunnels under the floor. The orphanage was built in June of 1952 at Chong P'yong-Ni by Korean carpenters. Brock's squad was transported by truck to work at the home. They insulated the overhead where the ceiling had been sweating.</abstract>
  <abstract>A meeting between the mayor of Kapyong province and 2nd Division Commander General James C. Fry in June of 1952 spawned the idea of building a division-sponsored orphanage, the 2nd Division Friendship Home. Soldiers of the division contributed monthly to a fund, and within five months, nearly $38,000 was raised. Korean contractors at the Chongpyong-ni site began construction on the 24-bedroom facility on September 20, 1952. The orphanage featured a recreation hall/study, dining hall, kitchen, bathrooms, washroom, employee living quarters, and storage room. Four officers and five enlisted men comprised the board of governors for the home. The 2nd Division Friendship Home was dedicated on Thanksgiving Day, 1952, and staffed by a Korean doctor-dentist, a teacher, two cooks, and a handyman. The fund also provided for clothing, building improvements, and toys to be purchased from Japan to assist the eighty-two Kapyong orphans, ranging in age from two to fifteen years, the orphanage initially housed. The donation fund was ongoing to support the upkeep of the facility and future projects such as a playground and landscaping. Second Division soldiers gifted the orphans with candy washcloths, toothpaste, toothbrushes, and soap, and they encouraged and funneled donations from the United States to the home, as well. Over four hundred orphanages in Korea were built or repaired by U.S. servicemen. With an estimated civilian casualty rate of nearly 70% of total casualties, (In contrast, World War II's percentage was estimated at forty.) the Korean War is thought to have generated 100,000 war orphans. These children garnered the label "dust of the street," having lost parents to wartime separation, bombs and bullets, disease, or hunger. American churches and civic organizations such as the Rotary Club and the American Legion rendered humanitarian aid to Korean orphans. The adoption of Korean War orphans by American families comprised the first mass wave of international, interracial adoptions and paved the way for those instances that followed.</abstract>
