  <abstract>This appears to be one of Brock's photos that had been exposed to X-rays when shipped home. He had perhaps six rolls of film of big self-propelled guns and heavy armaments. It was a hobby of Brock's to photograph them on his travels. The Army really did not want them photographed, but he had a camera with him all the time, and when he met up with equipment on the road, he would snap. This is a Patton tank. He mailed film home a month or two before being sent home himself; the film was x-rayed, and very few images from those rolls survived.</abstract>
  <abstract>Armor units (tanks) for the infantry divisions of the United States Army at the time of the Korean War were organized with a heavy tank battalion dedicated to a division and a tank company dedicated to a regiment. In addition, during the Korean War, the Army employed divisional reconnaissance companies and made sporadic use of several detached tank companies. When the conflict began, the absence of tank units in the Republic of Korea Army and the delay in getting Allied tanks comparable to the North Korean People's Army Russian-made T-34 tanks to the field meant that the superiority of enemy tanks figured heavily in the disastrous early Korean War clashes in July and August of 1950. The Second Infantry Division's 72nd Medium Tank Battalion came ashore in August of 1950 with a combination of M-26 Pershings and M-4A3E8 Shermans. Past this point in time, the major function of the tank units in the Korean War would be confined to infantry support. The M-4 Sherman tank, as with many of the small arms and artillery systems of the Korean War, was a hold-over from World War II. The Sherman tank went into service in 1942 and obtained iconic status and long-term, world-wide usage given its ease of production and repair, mechanical reliability, simplicity of operation, and relatively well-armored and well-armed state. The slopes, bogs, and rice paddies of Korea posed a challenge for some drivers of the M-4, but the larger drawbacks for this 400-horsepower gasoline-fueled workhorse were the comparatively thin armor and propensity to explode when hit, mainly due to the onboard stowage of ammunition propellant charges. The M-4 Sherman saw action throughout the Korean War and remained a mainstay with the United States military until it was replaced by the M48 Patton during the 1950s.</abstract>
