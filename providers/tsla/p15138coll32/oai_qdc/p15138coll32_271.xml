<dc:title>Cultivated Korean countryside near 2nd Division Orphanage</dc:title>
<dc:description>Brock records the Korean countryside surrounding the orphanage. This is a civilized, safe area. In this image, the most distinct, cultivated rows on flat ground are rice paddies. The terrain must be flat for the water to remain on the crop. The surrounding rows on the hilly, uneven earth might be beets, radishes, or the like. The Koreans made use of every bit of land they could for farming. They generally used wooden plows with wooden teeth pulled by water buffalo. Healthy trees and a farm shed are also present in this image.</dc:description>
<dc:description>A meeting between the mayor of Kapyong province and 2nd Division Commander General James C. Fry in June of 1952 spawned the idea of building a division-sponsored orphanage, the 2nd Division Friendship Home.&#160; Soldiers of the division contributed monthly to a fund, and within five months, nearly $38,000 was raised.&#160; Korean contractors at the Chongpyong-ni site began construction on the 24-bedroom facility on September 20, 1952.&#160; The orphanage featured a recreation hall/study, dining hall, kitchen, bathrooms, washroom, employee living quarters, and storage room.&#160; Four officers and five enlisted men comprised the board of governors for the home. The 2nd Division Friendship Home was dedicated on Thanksgiving Day, 1952, and staffed by a Korean doctor-dentist, a teacher, two cooks, and a handyman.&#160; The fund also provided for clothing, building improvements, and toys to be purchased from Japan to assist the eighty-two Kapyong orphans, ranging in age from two to fifteen years, the orphanage initially housed.&#160; The donation fund was ongoing to support the upkeep of the facility and future projects such as a playground and landscaping.&#160; Second Division soldiers gifted the orphans with candy washcloths, toothpaste, toothbrushes, and soap, and they encouraged and funneled donations from the United States to the home, as well.&#160; Over four hundred orphanages in Korea were built or repaired by U.S. servicemen.&#160; With an estimated civilian casualty rate of nearly 70% of total casualties, (In contrast, World War II&#8217;s percentage was estimated at forty.) the Korean War is thought to have generated 100,000 war orphans.&#160; These children garnered the label &#8220;dust of the street,&#8221; having lost parents to wartime separation, bombs and bullets, disease, or hunger.&#160; American churches and civic organizations such as the Rotary Club and the American Legion rendered humanitarian aid to Korean orphans. The adoption of Korean War orphans by American families comprised the first mass wave of international, interracial adoptions and paved the way for those instances that followed.</dc:description>
