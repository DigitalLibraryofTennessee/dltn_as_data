<dc:description>Ground was broken in south-central Missouri for a major Army training facility, the Seventh Corps Area Training Center, on December 3, 1940. The War Department named the installation Fort Leonard Wood. The service of Major General Leonard Wood spanned forty years and included functioning as a surgeon in the Apache Indian Wars of the 1880s, initially commanding the Rough Riders in the Spanish American War, serving as the Army's Chief of Staff, and holding the position of Governor General of the Philippine Islands. The fort that would bear Major General Wood's name first served as a World War II infantry division training area, but soon became an engineer training site, as well. Three hundred thousand soldiers received instruction at Fort Leonard Wood during the course of World War II. Though designated an inactive post following World War II, the Army reopened Fort Leonard Wood in 1950 to supply basic and engineer training to soldiers of the Korean War. The mission of training as the cadre unit for Fort Leonard Wood at this time was given to the reactivated 6th Armored Division. After the Korean War, Fort Leonard Wood became a permanent post designated as the United States Army Training Center Engineer. Fort Leonard Wood garnered the United States Army Engineer School in the 1980s when it was moved from Fort Belvoir, Virginia. In the 1990s, Fort Leonard Wood also came to house the United States Army Military Police School and the United States Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear School. David Franklin Brock was drafted and entered the Army for training on January 21st of 1952. After staying a week at Fort Jackson, South Carolina and being issued clothing and uniforms, Brock arrived at Fort Leonard Wood and received approximately two months of infantry training followed by several months of engineer instruction. Brock boarded the troop transport USS General W.A. Mann at San Francisco in early July of 1952 to sail for Korea.</dc:description>
