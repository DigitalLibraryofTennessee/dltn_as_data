<dc:title>Brock writing letter in room while on Tokyo R&amp;R</dc:title>
<dc:description>Brock is writing a letter while on leave in his hotel room at the Civil Service Hotel in Tokyo. He is dressed in his OD's (olive drab uniform), minus the jacket and cap. Brock had only this one-week leave during his tour of duty in Korea. He was close to being due another, when it was time for him to go home, but he didn't want to take it; the plane trouble during this leave made safety a consideration. Also, he wanted to get home more quickly.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Brock's experience of Rest and Recuperation (R&amp;R) was shared by more than 800,000 American soldiers in the Korean War. Inaugurated in early 1951, this morale-boosting military program allowed American soldiers and marines to earn five days of leave in a Japanese city for every 180 days of active duty, regardless of rank. The genesis of this program lay in World War II studies that indicated casualty rates increase dramatically past 180 consecutive days of combat service. Three processing centers received military personnel arriving by air and sea, and supplied them with new uniforms, pay, and accommodations. R&amp;R official quarters might be on military bases, at military Special Services hotels, or at civil service hotels that prioritized the military. Unofficially, however, soldiers might seek out private Japanese inns and hotels. American soldiers interacted with the Japanese in bars, clubs, hotels, and in the streets of cities like Tokyo. R&amp;R experiences allowed for not only a respite from the stresses of war, but also cemented American post-World War II reconciliation with the Japanese people.</dc:description>
