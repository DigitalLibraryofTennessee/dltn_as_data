<dc:description>Korean War soldiers were met with a unique experience as they came back to the United States from their service overseas. Due to the nature of the points rotation system, the troops did not return en masse, as was the case in previous American military conflicts. The lack of an official declaration of war; the absence of home front participation in the form of sacrifice; the waning popularity of the Korean War as it progressed; and the dearth of welcome home ceremonies, parades, and pomp undermined the position of Korean War veterans in the nation's consciousness and combined to further the notion that only tempered gratitude was being extended to these veterans. Their war became known as the forgotten one, and they have been referred to as the "silent generation," for they quietly served their country and re-entered a prosperous American society. These veterans, unlike others of past generations, were encouraged by the collective attitude of American society at the time to put their war experiences behind them. Given the lack of recognition and overt appreciation demonstrated for these Korean War veterans, the fact that any difficulties with post-war adjustment would be suffered bravely and in silence is not surprising. Brock recalls after the war having abandoned his life-long ambition of farming the family land in Van Buren County and riding around aimlessly in his newly-purchased car for a while, wasting his time and saved military pay in an attempt to "cool down."  Raised during the Great Depression and World War II on sacrifice and patriotism, this generation was asked to throw its shoulders back and march with the rest of the nation into the anticipated progress of the future decades.  The battles of Vietnam veterans to gain benefits and raise consciousness of their struggles, however, galvanized Korean War veterans to unite and seek delayed benefits, assistance with war-related issues, recognition, and the status befitting their service. </dc:description>
