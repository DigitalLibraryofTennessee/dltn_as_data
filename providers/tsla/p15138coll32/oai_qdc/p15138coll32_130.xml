<dc:title>Brock and Phillips at Greyhound Bus Station </dc:title>
<dc:description>Brock and his girlfriend, whom he later married, Laura Mae Phillips, are squatting down beside a car outside the Greyhound Bus Station in Nashville. Brock is wearing his OD (olive drab) training uniform, and is visiting with a weekend pass from Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. </dc:description>
<dc:description>Born in 1933 into a family of Tennessee sharecroppers at the height of the Great Depression, Laura Mae Phillips experienced sacrifice and hardship early in life. Phillips captured the attention of David Franklin Brock when they were teenagers, and he was immediately smitten. The two were sweethearts throughout the course of his service in the Korean War. Phillips's combined fear of commitment and delight in playing hard to get, however, led to her absenting herself several times when Brock came home on leave from training at Fort Leonard Wood and to her heading north for work in a Detroit spark plug factory while Brock was overseas. When Brock returned stateside in 1953, he renewed his courtship of Phillips, and they married in 1954.</dc:description>
