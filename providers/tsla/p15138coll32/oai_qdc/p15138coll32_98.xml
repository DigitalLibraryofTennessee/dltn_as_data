<dc:title>Brock pictured in front of stacked empty shell casings</dc:title>
<dc:description>Brock posing in front of empty shell casings for artillery rounds that are stacked like ricks of wood. All of them would have been fired at this location. Most of them were cardboard; the metal ones would have been retained. This is a different location than the image of Brock in the t-shirt in front of the shell casings.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The front lines largely stabilized north of Seoul in 1951, and the final two years of the Korean War (1952/1953) represented a static ground phase characterized by battles for hills and outposts along the main line of resistance (MLR). Stacks of empty artillery and mortar shell casings were the residue of artillery barrages at the front during this time period. Fifty-four battalions of field artillery were deployed by the United States to Korea, and it has been said that artillery proved the King of Battle for United Nations forces in this conflict. The use of heavy artillery escalated as the war dragged on. In comparison, July of 1953 found the enemy firing 375,565 artillery rounds at the Allied front; United Nations forces countered that same month with 2,000,982 rounds.</dc:description>
