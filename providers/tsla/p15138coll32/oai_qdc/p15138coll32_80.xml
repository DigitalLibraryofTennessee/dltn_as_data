<dc:title>Gathering of soldiers from 2nd Engineers</dc:title>
<dc:description>Blurry image of soldiers either having classes or having church. Brock believes it to be church. Soldiers would be out working, and they would be asked if they wanted to go to a church service. A truck driver would then take them to the gathering place.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This fuzzy image likely depicts a typical field service during the Korean War. Korean War chaplains and chaplain assistants navigated the challenging terrain of Korea to minister to the spiritual needs of the soldiers at the front. With their chaplain kits, they could hastily assemble an altar atop the hood of a jeep or even on ammunition crates. They often carried with them, as well, field organs, Bibles, and hymnbooks to utilize in these impromptu religious services. Fifteen United Nations (UN) countries had chaplains serving in the Korean War. When the conflict began, the United States Army responded to the intense need for chaplains by employing the reserve, issuing individual recalls of World War II chaplains, and recruiting, though the authorized number of chaplains was never met. Roughly 1,600 U.S. Army chaplains served throughout the course of the Korean War; the maximum number remained around three hundred at any given time. American and Korean civilians augmented these numbers by functioning as auxiliary chaplains. In addition to conducting nondenominational worship services, U.S. Army chaplains were tasked with protecting free exercise rights of soldiers and the rights of those without a faith, providing counseling and moral support, and maintaining troop morale. Chaplains might administer last rites, conduct memorial services for fallen soldiers, write death notifications for families, transmit messages to and from home through the Red Cross, convey health education, operate circulating libraries, and arrange sporting and recreational activities for the soldiers. Chaplains were stationed at U.S. military hospitals in Japan, on UN hospital ships, in military camps, and attached to mobile hospitals, in addition to traveling from unit to unit with the troops along the front. As chaplains comforted, ministered to and protected the wounded on the front lines, they often placed themselves in harm's way. Thirteen U.S. chaplains died as a result of enemy action, twenty-six were wounded; of the four chaplains captured by the enemy, none survived the experience. The Korean War saw twenty-two chaplains receive the Silver Star medal. July 29, 2016 marked the 241st birthday of the Chaplain Corps of the United States Army, with over 25,000 chaplains having served in more than 270 major wars and combat engagements. The Chaplain Corps was established in 1775, and today, it is comprised of 2,700 clergy members and represents over a hundred religious denominations. </dc:description>
