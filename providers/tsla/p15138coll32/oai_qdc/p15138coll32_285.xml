<dc:title>Soldier sweeping military bridge in preparation for dedication</dc:title>
<dc:description>Soldier seen sweeping the roped-off bridge in preparation for the dedication. Propped against the bridge are soldiers' M-1 rifles and coats. In the background at the other end of the bridge, a military truck is parked, and a jeep is driving away from the bridge. Brock believes that he and his combat engineer squad must have been passing through the area on an engineer mission around the time of the sign being erected and the dedication ceremony. They then stopped to take some pictures and pay their respects. </dc:description>
<dc:description>Hailing from Montgomery, Maryland and being a member of the 1951 Class of the United States Military Academy at West Point, Louis John Storck headed to Fort Belvoir, Virginia for engineer training. First Lieutenant Storck then made his way to Korea and the 2nd Infantry Division's 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion. The Army initially assigned Storck to Company D, but he was transferred to Company B to fill a leadership vacancy shortly after David Franklin Brock arrived. Storck made a deep impression on Brock, however. Brock remembers the Lieutenant as being a fine man and a highly respected officer. On October 6, 1952, Storck and three of his men were ordered to clear mines on the road to Mundung-ni, North Korea in the vicinity of Pangsok-tong. The soldiers operated under heavy enemy mortar and artillery fire around the outposts in front of Hill 281 throughout the course of the day. The outpost that had been occupied by French troops came under enemy attack at dusk, and Storck and his men bravely decided to remain and try to defend it. They repulsed an initial attempt to cut them off from the main line of resistance (MLR), having to resort to hand to hand combat. Night found their position overrun, and the soldiers cut off from the MLR. Though Storck and his men were wounded, under his leadership they attempted to cross into friendly lines. The four men crossed paths with the enemy, and the Lieutenant was mortally wounded. Storck's gallantry in action was recognized with the Silver Star. The pictured bridge built by Storck and his men as combat engineers was named in his honor.</dc:description>
