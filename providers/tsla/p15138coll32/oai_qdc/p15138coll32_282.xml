<dc:title>Engineer Martinez perched on a boulder in Kumhwa</dc:title>
<dc:description>Martinez, a soldier from Michigan, is pictured with a bayonet in his grasp. The 2nd Division's 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, Company D was doing intensive road work in this solitary area of Kumhwa. The terrain was quite rough, and Brock recalls that every hill that was mounted only allowed a view of perhaps a mile or two before vision was blocked by yet another higher hill.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Brock's service in the Korean War occurred in the vicinity of the Iron Triangle and near the 38th parallel. During this time (from July of 1952 to the end of the war), the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion was stationed at the Chorwon Valley, then in the Kumhwa region, and finally at the Hook. The 2nd Engineers set up base camps at these three stations and remained at each for approximately six months. The soldiers were a part of the rotation points system instituted in March of 1951 for all United Nations personnel. Service within different sectors garnered an assigned number of points per month, with more dangerous locations carrying a higher number of points. Assignments from the base camp would rotate closer toward the front and then back away. Thus, there were a certain number of days per month for which a soldier would receive extra combat pay. After extended periods of service near the front, the unit would be rotated to the rear, perhaps twenty-five miles from the lines, and placed in reserve for rest and additional training. Once a soldier had accumulated a certain number of points, he was eligible to return home; his position would be taken by a replacement. During 1952, the 2nd Division received an average of 1,800 replacements per month. The highest monthly total for the year of 3,000 replacements occurred in July of 1952--when Brock arrived in Korea as a replacement combat engineer. Though the rotation points system had the potential to heighten morale, it also could erode comradery and undermine unit allegiance with its notion of limited service. In Brock's case, it took fourteen months to obtain the necessary thirty-six points to leave Korea. When moving to a new station to set up a base camp, and thus, replace another unit, the 2nd Engineers might camp half a dozen times for a two-week period before reaching their final destination. With each stop, their supply of explosives, anti-personnel mines, and anti-tank mines had to be unloaded from trucks by the combat engineers and located a safe distance away from the main camp. Then, at the end of the two-week interval, these dangerous stores would be reloaded onto trucks, so the battalion could move out. When the 2nd Engineers arrived at the new station, the combat engineers could then deposit the explosives and mines at an adjacent site a safe distance away (usually on the side of a hill) for a period of months.</dc:description>
