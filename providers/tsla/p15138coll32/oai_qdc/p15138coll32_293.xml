<dc:title>C-124 Globemaster sits with jeeps and trucks at Korean air base</dc:title>
<dc:description>Korean military air base where Brock and Connors left and returned to Korea with their Tokyo R&amp;R. Military personnel walk around a cluster of miitary jeeps and trucks. Pictured is a C-124 Globemaster four-engine plane. Tanks could be driven into the open front of the plane; it was three-decks high inside the cargo hold. Brock flew in the same type of plane to Tokyo and back. The plane was 40,000 lbs. overweight and had mechanical trouble with an engine when taking off from Korea; the exact same plane carried Brock back to Korea from Japan following his R&amp;R. Another smaller plane is visible in the background of this photo.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Globemasters joined the other types of propeller-driven transport aircraft toward the end of the Korean War. Compared to the more common C-54 Skymasters and C-119 Flying Boxcars, the C-124 Globemasters were giants. The Globemasters were utilized in both of the two categories of Korean War transport aircraft, the tactical (intratheater) airlift of the Far East Air Force (FEAF) Combat Cargo Command and the strategic (intercontinental) airlift of the Military Air Transport Service (MATS). The United Nations Far East Air Force used fifteen air bases in Japan for combat support over the course of the war, and built or improved fifty-five airfields in Korea.</dc:description>
