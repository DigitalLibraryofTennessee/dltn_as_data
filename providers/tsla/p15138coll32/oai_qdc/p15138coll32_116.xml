<dc:title>Brock's training platoon at Fort Leonard Wood</dc:title>
<dc:description>Training photograph of Brock's platoon from Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri: 1st Platoon, Co. C, 86th Recon. Battalion, 6th Armd. Divi., Capt. Hugh P. Shaw C. O. (commanding officer). Note the presence of a number of African American soldiers in the platoon, indicating the racially integrated nature of military training for Korean War soldiers in the United States. </dc:description>
<dc:description>There would be a stark contrast between the military preparedness of the Army soldiers pictured in this image in 1952, and those facing the shock of combat on the Korean peninsula in the summer of 1950. At the beginning of the Korean War, the U.S. Army strength was 591,000 soldiers out of an authorized strength of 630,201. Post World War II Army leadership confronted rapid demobilization, huge manpower and defense budget cuts implemented by the Truman administration and Congress, lack of new equipment, the occupation demands of Germany and Japan, and uneven basic training cycles for new inductees. The repercussions of all these conditions came to bear on the members of the regular military, the reserves, and National Guard troops rushed into action after North Korean soldiers invaded South Korea on June 25, 1950. Also, the desegregated nature of the unit pictured here contrasts with conditions in the military at the beginning of the Korean War. The battlefield pressure of the Korean War would become the catalyst for the full implementation of President Harry S. Truman's Executive Order No. 9981 that provided for the desegregation of the United States armed forces. Commander in Chief of the Far East Command General Matthew B. Ridgway began the total integration of U.S. Army combat units in Korea in the late summer and fall of 1951. In Brock's case, his military training program and housing at Fort Leonard Wood were racially integrated, as would be the squad tents of his combat engineer company, with black and white soldiers sleeping, eating, working, and relaxing together. Ground was broken in south-central Missouri for a major Army training facility, the Seventh Corps Area Training Center, on December 3, 1940. The War Department named the installation Fort Leonard Wood. The service of Major General Leonard Wood spanned forty years and included functioning as a surgeon in the Apache Indian Wars of the 1880s, initially commanding the Rough Riders in the Spanish American War, serving as the Army's Chief of Staff, and holding the position of Governor General of the Philippine Islands. The fort that would bear Major General Wood's name first served as a World War II infantry division training area, but soon became an engineer training site, as well. Three hundred thousand soldiers received instruction at Fort Leonard Wood during the course of World War II. Though designated an inactive post following World War II, the Army reopened Fort Leonard Wood in 1950 to supply basic and engineer training to soldiers of the Korean War. The mission of training as the cadre unit for Fort Leonard Wood at this time was given to the reactivated 6th Armored Division. After the Korean War, Fort Leonard Wood became a permanent post designated as the United States Army Training Center Engineer. Fort Leonard Wood garnered the United States Army Engineer School in the 1980s when it was moved from Fort Belvoir, Virginia. In the 1990s, Fort Leonard Wood also came to house the United States Army Military Police School and the United States Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear School. David Franklin Brock was drafted and entered the Army for training on January 21st of 1952. After staying a week at Fort Jackson, South Carolina and being issued clothing and uniforms, Brock arrived at Fort Leonard Wood and received approximately two months of infantry training followed by several months of engineer instruction. Brock boarded the troop transport USS General W.A. Mann at San Francisco in early July of 1952 to sail for Korea.</dc:description>
