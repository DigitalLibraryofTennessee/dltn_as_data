<dc:title>Rest for Brock during Korean War R&amp;R</dc:title>
<dc:description>Brock'stretched out on a bed in his hotel room at the Civil Service Hotel in Tokyo where he spent his one-week leave. A phone is visible. This may have been one of the nights he and fellow soldier Connors called downstairs to the wine bar to have them send up wine to the room.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Brock's experience of Rest and Recuperation (R&amp;R) was shared by more than 800,000 American soldiers in the Korean War. Inaugurated in early 1951, this morale-boosting military program allowed American soldiers and marines to earn five days of leave in a Japanese city for every 180 days of active duty, regardless of rank. The genesis of this program lay in World War II studies that indicated casualty rates increase dramatically past 180 consecutive days of combat service. Three processing centers received military personnel arriving by air and sea, and supplied them with new uniforms, pay, and accommodations. R&amp;R official quarters might be on military bases, at military Special Services hotels, or at civil service hotels that prioritized the military. Unofficially, however, soldiers might seek out private Japanese inns and hotels. American soldiers interacted with the Japanese in bars, clubs, hotels, and in the streets of cities like Tokyo. R&amp;R experiences allowed for not only a respite from the stresses of war, but also cemented American post-World War II reconciliation with the Japanese people.</dc:description>
