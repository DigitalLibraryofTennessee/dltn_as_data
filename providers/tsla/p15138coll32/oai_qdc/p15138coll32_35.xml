<dc:title>Brock and buddies in reserve</dc:title>
<dc:description>Martinez, Brock, and an unknown soldier pictured in reserve. The fence in the image is to keep Korean civilians out.  Brock's unit went into reserve twice during his service--once in January of 1953 and once in the spring of 1953.</dc:description>
<dc:description>In the Korean War, combat engineer units rotated toward the front, often attached to combat infantry regiments to provide support. After extended periods of service near the front, units would be rotated to the rear, perhaps twenty-five miles from the lines, and placed in reserve for approximately thirty days for rest, additional training and equipping, and possible secondary missions. Combat engineers in particular seemed charged with continuing their construction and maintenance assignments while in reserve. The 2nd Engineers spent most of January of 1953 in reserve; the battalion also moved its companies through reserve during April, May, and most of June of 1953. During both periods of reserve, the 2nd Engineers rehabilitated their vehicles and equipment and received training in engineer and infantry tactics.</dc:description>
