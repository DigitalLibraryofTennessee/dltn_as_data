<dc:title>Brock heavily-outfitted for work near Kumhwa front</dc:title>
<dc:description>Brock is in the Kumhwa area. The front is directly behind him, past the cloaking camouflage netting. He has his helmet on, his flak jacket, and is carrying his M-1. These rifles were used during World War II and were packed in cosmalean grease and left in Japan. It took a day or two to clean them out after they were issued. His cap is on under his helmet, with his engineer's pin attached to the bill. The cap probably had fur flaps.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This image of Brock conveys the harshness of both weather and terrain on the Korean peninsula and the dangers at the front lines faced by American soldiers in the Korean War. Winter brought temperatures often thirty degrees below zero Fahrenheit,
accompanied by heavy snow and bitter winds. These conditions produced frozen grounds and equipment, as well as frostbite. Some soldiers slept with guns to their chest to prevent their weapons from freezing up. Troops like Brock entering the theater in 1952, however, were infinitely better prepared, equipped and outfitted for cold weather than those facing the early and tragic winter of 1950-51. Humid, sweltering summers with temperatures often exceeding one hundred degrees Fahrenheit brought out disease, rats, and insects. Monsoon season washed out bridges and roads and flooded trenches, bunkers, and dugouts. Trucks and guns became bogged down and had to be pulled out of the resulting mud; soldiers caked in mud were also encumbered. The weather proved one foe of those waging war, and the terrain proved another. The topography of Korea is almost eighty percent mountainous. The landscape of rugged mountains, hills, and valleys resulted in few roads, narrow in nature.  Transversing even short distances under these conditions expended much time and effort for the armed forces; steep slopes and rice paddies filled with perhaps one hundred-year-old water challenged men, weapons, and vehicles. Military engineers had their work cut out for them, building up transportation networks for operations and supply and tackling river obstacles.The main line of resistance (MLR) is defined as the line or zone of contact with the enemy; it is also referred to as the front or front lines. In the Korean War, the area known as no man's land separated the fronts of the two sides. It was heavily mined and contained trip flares to alert military forces to enemy penetration. The front lines largely stabilized north of Seoul in 1951, and the final two years of the Korean War (1952/1953) represented a static ground phase characterized by battles for hills and outposts along the MLR. A combat engineer seeks to advance his dual mission of keeping armies moving to attack, and impeding the enemy. In the Korean War, combat engineer units rotated toward the front, often attached to combat infantry regiments to provide support. Brock's Company D of the 2nd Infantry Division's 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, though attached to the 72nd Tank Battalion, possessed more mobility than other companies of the 2nd Engineers. Squads from Company D made up of ten to twelve men were generally sent out from base camp on location to tackle necessary construction, repair, and demolition assignments. When near the front, however, the company, like the rest of the 2nd Engineers, remained on call twenty-four hours a day. During this time, these soldiers often labored all day on engineer projects and at night were called to the front lines when the enemy tried to break through. Brock experienced the fiercest fighting as a combat infantryman and in conjunction with his engineer work in the Hook sector of the MLR near the Samichon River. This would have been the time of the bloody last battle of the Hook in July of 1953.</dc:description>
