<dc:title>Quonset hut pictured in financial district near Kumhwa </dc:title>
<dc:description>In the image, a metal quonset hut is present. The lines are probably telephone lines. The occasion was the moving of the 2nd Division Engineers Supply Depot fifteen or twenty miles closer to the front. Brock's company was helping to relocate this facility. Brock remembers during their dinner breaks, the soldiers would watch the British Air Force fly vertically and create sonic booms. The location here was in the Kumhwa region. The 1st Marine Division was on the west coast near the Hook. Most other Engineer companies had certain locations they were assigned to. Brock's company was not tied down to serve a particular area; they could be sent anywhere. </dc:description>
<dc:description>As a Korean War soldier in the 2nd Infantry Division's 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, Company D attached to the 72nd Tank Battalion, David Franklin Brock built roads, bridges, and bunkers for the front while often under enemy fire. Brock, a demolitions specialist, detonated explosives and laid and cleared land mines. As with all combat engineers, he was trained in combat infantry, and, when needed, functioned as an infantry soldier. Brock's in-theater service occurred in the vicinity of the Iron Triangle and near the 38th parallel. During this time (from July of 1952 to the end of the war), the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion was stationed at the Chorwon Valley, then in the Kumhwa region, and finally at the Hook. Brock'served his country from January 1952 to October 1953 and was promoted to corporal. He came home to Van Buren County on active reserve.</dc:description>
