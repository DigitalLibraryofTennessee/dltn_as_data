  <abstract>United States. Navy; U.S.S. Tampa</abstract>
  <abstract>White</abstract>
  <abstract>Originally a Coast Guard cutter, when the U.S. declared war with Germany on April 6, 1917, the U.S.S. Tampa was immediately transferred to the U.S. Navy and ordered to duty overseas. It was based in Gibraltar, where its mission was to protect convoys from submarine attacks as it escorted them from Gibraltar to Britain. On the evening of September 26, 1918, as the Tampa was crossing the British channel, a German submarine attacked it, sinking the Tampa with a single torpedo. Search and rescue efforts turned up only one body; two other bodies in U.S. naval uniforms washed ashore in Wales two days later. In 1999, the Coast Guard posthumously awarded each Tampa crewman a Purple Heart. http://www.uscg.mil/history/webcutters/tampa_1912.asp</abstract>
