<dc:title>Broadcloth coat tailored by Governor Andrew Johnson</dc:title>
<dc:description>Broadcloth coat tailored by Governor Andrew Johnson in 1853.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Facing family poverty after the death of his father, the young Johnson had been apprenticed to James Selby, a tailor in Raleigh, North Carolina, where he learned the craft.  In 1826, Johnson moved to Greeneville where he opened his own tailoring business. He continued practicing his skills as a tailor throughout his political career as Governor of Tennessee and President of the United States. The coat is now housed in the collections of the Tennessee State Museum, Nashville, Tennessee.</dc:description>
