<dc:description>At an early age Andrew Johnson was apprenticed to a local tailor in Raleigh, North Carolina, where he learned his craft. After moving with his family to Greeneville, Tennessee, in 1826, Johnson opened his own tailoring business, which became a meeting place for neighbors to discuss local events and politics.  He practiced tailoring for years, even after being elected to political office.</dc:description>
