<dc:title>Birthplace of Andrew Johnson</dc:title>
<dc:description>Presumed birthplace of President Andrew Johnson in Raleigh, North Carolina.  Johnson is said to have been born in this house on December 29, 1809, at its original location on Fayetteville Street.  In 1909, the Colonial Dames of America purchased the house and presented it to the City of Raleigh.  It was later relocated to the grounds of Raleigh's Mordecai Historic Park.  A duplicate of the building is located at the Andrew Johnson National Historic Site in Greeneville, Tenn.</dc:description>
<dc:description>There is some doubt among historians as to whether this building is the true birthplace of President Johnson. A published interview with Mrs. Susan Stewart by Union Army officers in 1865 indicated that the true birth residence of Johnson had been lost to demolition many years before.  Mrs. Stewart recalled that she knew Johnson's parents, who had lived on her family's property on Fayetteville Street, and said she had been asked by Andrew's mother, Polly Johnson, to name the child at his birth.</dc:description>
