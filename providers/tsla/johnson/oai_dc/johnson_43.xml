<dc:title>"Sir Veto" Medal</dc:title>
<dc:description>Small medallion honoring Andrew Johnson, who earned the nickname "Sir Veto" because of the large number of legislative vetoes he issued during his Presidency. The obverse contains the Johnson's profile and the dates of his term of office.  The reverse includes a brief biography and mentions his other moniker, "The Tailor President."</dc:description>
<dc:description>President Andrew Johnson issued more vetoes than all his predecessors: the total includes 19 vetoes, 6 "pocket vetoes," and 16 bills that became law without his signature. This note was on the envelope in which the medal arrived: "This medal was sent to the Tennessee State Library in the spring of 1952 by Mr. Harry Brixey, 182 High St., Eastleigh, Hampshire, England."</dc:description>
