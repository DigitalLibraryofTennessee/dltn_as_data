<dc:description>Broadside reads, "Ex-President Johnson Has accepted an invitation to address the people of Lincoln County, at Fayetteville, On Tuesday, July 13th 1869.  Come hear him!  Printed at the Observer Office, Fayetteville, Tenn."</dc:description>
<dc:description>Former President Andrew Johnson toured many Tennessee cities after he left the Presidency in an attempt to garner support for his nomination as United States Senator.
