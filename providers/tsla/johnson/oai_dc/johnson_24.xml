<dc:title>John C. McRae steel engraving of President Andrew Johnson</dc:title>
<dc:description>Steel engraving of President Andrew Johnson by John C. McRae, engraver, with Johnson's autograph and the quote, "The Duties are Mine. I will Perform Them Trusting in God." Depictions of various scenes from Johnson's life surround his portrait.  This portrait is undated but was presumably made during Johnson's Presidential adminstration, 1865-1869.</dc:description>
<dc:description>John C. McRae (aka MacCrae) was a New York artist employed by publishers from approximately 1845 to 1880 to depict specialized portraits and scenes from American history. McRae was one of the first American artists to utilize the "mixed method technique," in which foreground figures are delineated by engraving, while backgrounds are composed largely of mezzotint tones.</dc:description>
