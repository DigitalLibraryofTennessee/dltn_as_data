<dc:description>Under conditions of the Presidential Proclamation of May 29, 1865, the amnesty provision pardoned all participants in the Southern Rebellion, restored their properties (except for slaves and any property that had been or might be legally confiscated), and required them to take the loyalty oath to the United States Constitution. Overton (1821-1898), son of Judge John Overton, was an influential businessman and planter in Nashville and a supporter of Southern independence.</dc:description>
