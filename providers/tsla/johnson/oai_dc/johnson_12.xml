<dc:description>Mezzotint-process portrait of Andrew Johnson, published by William Smith, Philadelphia, "entered according to Act of Congress in the year 1865 by William Sartain in the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the Eastern District of Penn" (Pennsylvania).

<dc:description>This portrait of Andrew Johnson was made by William Sartain, one of the most celebrated American engravers of the time, shortly after Johnson assumed the Presidency in 1865. Sartain's father, John, had pioneered the mezzotint method of engraving in the U.S., and both produced work for their publication, "Sartain's Union Magazine of Literature and Art." William Sartain was one of the founders of the Society of American Artists and an associate of the National Academy of Design.</dc:description>
