<dc:title>Presidential pardon for N. B. Forrest</dc:title>
<dc:description>Official presidential pardon from President Andrew Johnson to Lieutenant General Nathan Bedford Forrest, CSA, dated July 17, 1868.</dc:description>
<dc:description>In his third in a series of four amnesty proclamations, President Andrew Johnson issued pardons for former Confederates, including Lt. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest, on July 17, 1868. Many scholars have argued that Johnson's motives to appeal to Southern politicians in his attempt to curry favor prior to the Democratic National Convention was a plan to get him renominated for president.  This pardon would become controversial due to Forrest's war record and involvement with the Ku Klux Klan.</dc:description>
