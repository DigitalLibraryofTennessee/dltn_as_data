<dc:description>The Andrew Johnson homestead is a Greek Revival two-story brick residence located on Main Street, Greeneville, Tennessee.  President Johnson acquired this house in 1851.  During the War between the States, both Union and Confederate armies used the home as officers quarters.  Johnson and his family moved back here after he left the Presidency in 1869.  Johnson, who died in 1875, willed the property to his family.</dc:description>
