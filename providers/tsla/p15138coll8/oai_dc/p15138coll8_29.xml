<dc:description>Martha A. (Jones) Gentry of Franklin, Tennessee, was the wife of Watson Meredith Gentry.  Her daughter was Susie Gentry (1860-1944).  Susie Gentry was a genealogist, artist, composer, historian, and regent of the Old Glory Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution in Williamson County.  Eight pointed star quilts appeared in England and the eastern United States in the early 1800s.  The tiny, colorful diamonds can resemble the patterns of a kaleidoscope.  Also known as Star of the East, Star of Bethlehem, and Lone Star, this pattern is popular with Native American quilters.  The Japanese style of asymmetrical art was exhibited during the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition of 1876. The "Crazy" quilt pattern cropped up during the Victorian period as a way for women to include the Japanese design they had seen in their quilts. Most Crazy quilts were made with silk, satin, or velvet as opposed to cotton and were only used as display quilts. Crazy quilts can be identified by their uneven fabric blocks and the fine ornamental embroidery stitches on their tops. Popular decorative motifs on these quilts included fans, animals, and insects. Spiders and webs can often be seen on Crazy quilts as they were thought to bring good luck to the quiltmaker.</dc:description>
