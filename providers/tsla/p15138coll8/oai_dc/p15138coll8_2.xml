<dc:description>The word "quilt" is derived from the Latin word culcita, which means a stuffed sack, mattress, or cushion. A pieced butterfly is traditionally appliqued to a block, and the blocks are sewed together to form the quilt top. The Butterfly block pattern was a popular American design in the 1930s. The butterfly symbolized hope and new life during the Great Depression.</dc:description>
