<dc:description>Two letters of correspondence between Mrs. John Trotwood Moore and her cousin, Susie Gentry.  The first item of correspondence is from Susie Gentry to Mary Daniel Moore, written from Franklin, Tennessee, on May 28, 1934.  In her correspondence, Gentry discusses the Natchez Trace Road, the Old Glory Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, the Colonel Thomas Hart Benton Chapter of the United States Daughters of the War of 1812, and an inkblot she has made to look like a boy.  The second piece of correspondence is a response from Mrs. Moore, dated June 1, 1934.  Mrs. Moore states that she didn't know what an artist Miss Gentry was until she saw her lovely quilt and the ink spot on her letter.</dc:description>
