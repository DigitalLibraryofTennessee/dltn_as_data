<dc:description>The two infants pictured were born about nine days apart and later married each other.  The Japanese style of asymmetrical art was exhibited during the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition of 1876.  The &#8220;Crazy&#8221; quilt pattern cropped up during the Victorian period as a way for women to include the Japanese design they had seen in their quilts.  Most Crazy quilts were made with silk, satin, or velvet as opposed to cotton and were only used as display quilts.  Crazy quilts can be identified by their uneven fabric blocks and the fine ornamental embroidery stitches on their tops.   Popular decorative motifs on these quilts included fans, animals, and insects.  Spiders and webs can often be seen on Crazy quilts as they were thought to bring good luck to the quiltmaker.</dc:description>
