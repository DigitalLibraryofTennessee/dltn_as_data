<dc:description>Alfred's mother Betty (1793-1870) was the Jackson's cook; his uncle George was Jackson's personal servant and later the family carriage driver. Alfred assisted with the horses, maintained the wagons and farm equipment, and after emancipation was a tenant farmer at the Hermitage. He became a handyman and tour guide after the Hermitage became a museum. He lived at the Hermitage until his death and is buried near Andrew and Rachel Jackson.</dc:description>
