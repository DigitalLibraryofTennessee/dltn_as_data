<dc:description>Audio excerpt of Jewel Allen oral history recorded as part of the Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project.  He discusses how his wife learned to quilt from her family and how he began quilting himself. People have offered to buy his quilts, but he did not feel they offered him enough for his work. He says he tries to make an honest living piecing quilts and bottoming chairs, but the living is meager and lonely.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Tennessee State Parks Folklife Project began in 1979 under the direction of Park Ranger Bobby Fulcher and continued until 1983. Each summer during those years, three folklorists were stationed in Tennessee's state parks. From those bases, they conducted interviews, took photographs, and recorded music with local tradition-bearers.</dc:description>
