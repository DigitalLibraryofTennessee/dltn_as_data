<dc:description>The Dresden Plate quilt pattern was one of the most popular quilts made during the 1920s and 30s. It was also called Grandmother's Sunburst, Friendship Ring, Aster, Dahlia, and Sunflower.  It is similar to the Fan patterns of the late 1800s. Some Dresden Plate blocks seem to be made of four fans sewn together. Dresden, Germany, was known for its fine porcelain plates, which seem to have inspired this design.</dc:description>
