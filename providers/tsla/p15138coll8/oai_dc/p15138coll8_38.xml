<dc:description>The quilting bee became a tradition probably during the 19th Century.  Many bees were simply an occasion wherein women assisted one another in finishing quilts.  They eventually became an opportunity for women to gather in a social environment.  The bee itself often featured a large wooden frame around which many women would work on the same quilt.</dc:description>
