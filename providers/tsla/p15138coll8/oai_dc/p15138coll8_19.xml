<dc:description>The sunbonnet design in quilting originated in the 1870s, based on the motif of a broad-brimmed bonnet that obscures the face of a young girl.  The pattern is frequently called "Sunbonnet Sue," after a popular 1908 song.  The name was applied to the quilt pattern after the Great Depression.  In the South, the name "Dutch Doll" persisted until after national publications helped standardize quilt pattern names.</dc:description>
