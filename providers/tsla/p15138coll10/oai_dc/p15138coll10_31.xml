<dc:description>Austrian-born Felix de Weldon, who became the foremost American sculptor of the 20th century, specialized in representations of military heroes, statesmen, and religious leaders.  His masterpiece was The Flag Raising on Iwo Jima. The York monument (1968) reads "Armed with his rifle and pistol, his courage and skill, one Tennessean silenced a German battalion of 35 machine guns, killing 25 enemy soldiers, and capturing 132 in the Argonne Forest of France, October 8, 1918."</dc:description>
