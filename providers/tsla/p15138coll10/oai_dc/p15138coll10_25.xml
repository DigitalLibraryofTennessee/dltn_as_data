<dc:description>The Rotary Club of Nashville joined with other Tennessee clubs in collecting funds so they could present York with a home and a farm. Unfortunately, they raised only enough to give him an unfinished home and a healthy mortgage. As late as 1922, the deed remained in the hands of the Nashville Rotary Club.</dc:description>
