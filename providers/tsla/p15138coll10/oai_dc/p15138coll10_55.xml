<dc:description>Pall Mall in Fentress County was Alvin York's hometown.  Photographs were taken during a series of meetings between York and Hollywood producers related to a proposed film based on his World War I exploits. York founded the school in 1926 and it continues to be operated by the state. The school's newspaper bears the name "Pine Needles" after the pine trees on the grounds.</dc:description>
