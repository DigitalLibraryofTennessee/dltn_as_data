<dc:description>An unidentified farmer is standing on a device that appears to be a skid elevated by 3 or more long wooden dowels.  A mule is harnessed to it by two chains and a rope is attached to the left side of the mule's mouth area known as a side pull.  The field is partially plowed.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A side pull is a bitless bridle. Reins are attached to rings on either side of the animal's muzzle. When both reins are pulled, pressure is placed on the animal's nose, cuing a halt. Pulling on one rein cues the horse to turn its head in that direction; pulling on the left rein cues the horse to turn left, etc.  Mules were a key element in Tennessee's farm economy.  Between 1870 and 1880, mules replaced oxen as the main work stock in Tennessee.</dc:description>
