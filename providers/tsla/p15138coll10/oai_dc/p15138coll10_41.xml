<dc:description>Alvin C. York's heroism went unnoticed in the United States, even in Tennessee, until the publication of the April 26, 1919, issue of the Saturday Evening Post.  In an article titled "The Second Elder Gives Battle"  (pp. 1-4 ff.), journalist George Patullo first told the story that would soon become legend.  The Post's readership totaled over 2 million people.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Journalist Patullo learned of York's story while touring battlefields in 1919. Sergeant Alvin C. York, a poorly-educated Tennessee mountaineer, was a national hero, decorated for acts of bravery as a soldier in Company G, 328th Infantry during World War I. York was awarded his nation's highest decoration, the Medal of Honor, for his actions on October 8, 1918, during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive against the German forces.</dc:description>
