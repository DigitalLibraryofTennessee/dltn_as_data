<dc:description>Alvin York was one of the most decorated American soldiers in World War I.  He was awarded a Medal of Honor and a French Croix de Guerre for taking a German machine gun nest and assisting in the capture of 132 German soldiers. The York property, later to become a state park, was paid for by the Nashville Rotary Club, but it was built in York's hometown of Pall Mall in Fentress County.</dc:description>
