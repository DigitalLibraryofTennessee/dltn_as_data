<dc:description>Warner Brothers producer Jesse Lasky had sought to secure movie rights to the York story since 1919.  York finally relented around 1940 when Lasky argued that Americans needed inspiration in light of the war in Europe.  The film became the highest-grossing movie of 1941 and was nominated for eleven Oscars.</dc:description>
