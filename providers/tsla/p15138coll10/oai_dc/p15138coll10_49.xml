<dc:description>Fentress County was Alvin York's home county. This photo was taken during meetings between York and Hollywood producers related to a proposed film, "Sergeant York," based on his World War I exploits.  Photographer was Albert Franklin Ganier Sr., who captured photos of the meeting between York and Warner Brothers filmmakers as they researched the film. Mark Twain never lived in Jamestown but referred to it in his writings, frequently calling it "Obedstown" after the nearby Obeds River.</dc:description>
