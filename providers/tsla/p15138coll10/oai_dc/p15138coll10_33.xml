<dc:description>A woman is standing on a porch near a wash tub with a wash board inside. The tub is raised by laying a wooden chair on its side. Two large lard cans just visible beside the chair may hold cleaning products. The woman is dressed in a sunbonnet, dark blouse, and a wet, tattered apron that hangs to just above her ankles. Her stockings are wrinkled and her shoes appear wet. In her right hand she holds a tall homemade broom that appears to be very roughly made.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The straw for brooms comes from broom straw or broomcorn, a relative of sorghum cane. The seeds are combed from the seed head, leaving the straw or bristles which are bunched around a handle, then tied or woven to it.</dc:description>
