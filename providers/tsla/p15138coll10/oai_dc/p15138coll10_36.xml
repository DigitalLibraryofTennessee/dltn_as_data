<dc:description>A woman is standing on a porch near a wash tub with a wash board inside. The tub is raised by laying a wooden chair on its side. Two large lard cans just visible beside the chair may hold cleaning products. The woman is dressed in a sunbonnet, dark blouse, and a wet, tattered apron that hangs to just above her ankles. Her stockings are wrinkled and her shoes appear wet. In her right hand she holds a tall homemade broom.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Early laundry required plenty of soft water -- lye or soda could be put in hard water  to soften it, but lye is quite caustic. Two wash-forms are needed: one for the two tubs for suds, and the other for blueing and starching-tubs. Also necessary are a large wooden dipper, (metal can rust), two or three pails, a grooved washboard, and a clothesline.</dc:description>
