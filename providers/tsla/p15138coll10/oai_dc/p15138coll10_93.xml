<dc:description>A small, run-down cabin with an old stone chimney on the left.  An elderly man and woman are standing in front of the open doorway. He is stooped and holding a cane. She has a crutch under each arm. Both appear to be dressed in their best.  Behind each of them is a wooden ladderback chair. A sunbonnet hangs on one chair, and a man's hat is on the other.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Between the stock market crash of 1929 and the end of World War II, Tennessee transformed from a rural landscape with limited access to electricity to a state capable of hosting the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and part of the Manhattan Project within its borders. Congress passed the Tennessee Valley Authority Act, one of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal programs, in 1933, providing not only electricity but also much-needed jobs.</dc:description>
