<dc:subject>York, Alvin Cullum, 1887-1964; Clippings (Books, newspapers, etc.); Scrapbooks; Fund raising</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Newspaper clipping requesting donations to pay off the $12,500 mortgage of the farm purchased by the Nashville Rotary Club and presented to Alvin York for his exploits in World War I.  It encourages everyone to make a donation to York, declaring him the "greatest hero of the greatest war in the history of the world."  It clarifies that York is not requesting this money -- the Rotary Club and Nashville newspapers have organized this project independently to honor York's accomplishments.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Alvin York was one of the most decorated American soldiers in World War I.  He was awarded a Medal of Honor and a French Croix de Guerre for taking a German machine gun nest and assisting in the capture of 132 German soldiers.  The York property, later to become a state park, was paid for by the Nashville Rotary Club, but it was built in York's hometown of Pall Mall in Fentress County.</dc:description>
