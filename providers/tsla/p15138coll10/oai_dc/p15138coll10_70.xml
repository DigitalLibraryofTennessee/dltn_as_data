<dc:description>Forty or more men and women are gathered in a wooded area for a rifle shoot. Two young girls, who appear to be between 8 and 12, are also in attendance. The older girl is holding a camera. The ground is covered in leaves, and the trees are bare of foliage. Almost all of the men are wearing hats, except for producer Jesse Lasky (back view). The four women in the group are probably assocated with Mr. Lasky's group.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Rifle shoots brought together many expert riflemen. A public rifle shoot could draw the finest fields of sharpshooters in an area.</dc:description>
