<dc:description>The Alvin C. York home was built in 1922 by Orestes Crowley.  In 1925, York opened a general store across from the house and purchased a two-story grist mill on the Wolf River near his land.  The property was sold to the State of Tennessee in several purchases from 1967 to 1984.  The propery was eventually added to the National Register of Historic Places (1973) and listed as a National Historic Landmark (1976).</dc:description>
