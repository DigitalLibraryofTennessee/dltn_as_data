<dc:description>A man with a long stick (4 or more feet) in his hands sits on the stoop of a rough wooden cabin. He wears frayed and  patched overalls with a shirt, suit jacket, and hat.  A small blond boy between 6 and 8 is standing on the ground near the left corner of the porch. The boy's clothes are much like the man's. The house is in very poor repair. Another building on the man's right appears to be in somewhat better condition.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Appalachian region of the U.S., while abundant in natural resources and rich in potential, lags behind the rest of the nation in its economic growth.  Its people have not shared proportionately in the country's prosperity. The region's uneven past development, with its traditional reliance on a few basic industries and a marginal agriculture, has failed to provide the economic base that might produce vigorous, self-sustaining growth.</dc:description>
