  <abstract>President Lyndon B. Johnson and others on grandstand bowing heads during prayer, Columbia State Community College.</abstract>
  <abstract>Columbia State Community College was founded in 1966 as the first community college in the Tennessee Board of Regents. On March 15, 1967, Lady Bird Johnson dedicated the campus, accompanied by her husband, President Lyndon B. Johnson. Lyndon B. Johnson (1908-1973) was the 36th President of the United States from 1963-1969 and was John F. Kennedy's Vice President until Kennedy's assassination. Lady Bird Johnson (1912-2007) broke new ground by interacting directly with Congress and beautifying the nation's cities and highways. On March 15, 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson and his wife Lady Bird Johnson made a day-long trip to Nashville. The Tennessee General Assembly invited Johnson to speak at a joint session to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the birth of President Andrew Jackson. Their one-day tour resulted in trips to the Hermitage, the Polk House, Ellington Agricultural Center, Columbia State Community College, and the Tennessee State Capitol.</abstract>
