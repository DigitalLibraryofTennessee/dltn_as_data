  <abstract>Lyndon B. Johnson and Gov. Ellington at the Ellington Agricultural Center, examining Ellington's show horse Sun's Queen Cathy.</abstract>
  <abstract>Ellington Agricultural Center is the heart of the state's agricultural interests, housing the headquarters of the Tennessee Department of Agriculture, the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, and the Tennessee Agricultural Museum. It was named for Buford Ellington, who pushed for the state to purchase the land as an Agricultural center. Ellington served as Governor from 1959-1963 and 1967-1971. Lyndon B. Johnson (1908-1973) was the 36th President of the United States from 1963-1969 and was John F. Kennedy's Vice President until Kennedy's assassination. Lady Bird Johnson (1912-2007) broke new ground by interacting directly with Congress and beautifying the nation's cities and highways. On March 15, 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson and his wife Lady Bird Johnson made a day-long trip to Nashville. The Tennessee General Assembly invited Johnson to speak at a joint session to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the birth of President Andrew Jackson. Their one-day tour resulted in trips to the Hermitage, the Polk House, Ellington Agricultural Center, Columbia State Community College, and the Tennessee State Capitol.</abstract>
