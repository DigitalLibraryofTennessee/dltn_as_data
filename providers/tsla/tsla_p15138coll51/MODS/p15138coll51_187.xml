  <abstract>President Lyndon B. Johnson's visit to Nashville. Shows view of log cabin located on the grounds of The Hermitage, home of Andrew Jackson.</abstract>
  <abstract>The Hermitage was the home of Andrew Jackson. It was built in 1819 and enlarged in 1831. It is a Greek Revival mansion located in Davidson County, Tennessee, outside of Nashville. Today, the house and grounds are a popular tourist attraction for visitors nationwide. Lyndon B. Johnson (1908-1973) was the 36th President of the United States from 1963-1969 and was John F. Kennedy's Vice President until Kennedy's assassination. Lady Bird Johnson (1912-2007) broke new ground by interacting directly with Congress and beautifying the nation's cities and highways. On March 15, 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson and his wife Lady Bird Johnson made a day-long trip to Nashville. The Tennessee General Assembly invited Johnson to speak at a joint session to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the birth of President Andrew Jackson. Their one-day tour resulted in trips to the Hermitage, the Polk House, Ellington Agricultural Center, Columbia State Community College, and the Tennessee State Capitol.</abstract>
