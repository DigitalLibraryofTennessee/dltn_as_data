<dc:description>Victory over Japan Day (also known as V-J Day) is the day when Imperial Japan surrendered to the Allies during World War II, which effectively brought the war to an end. The term has been applied to several different days. In Japan, their surrender was announced on the afternoon of August 15, 1945 and because of time zone differences, other countries such as the United States and United Kingdom heard word of Japan's surrender on August 14, 1945. The United States celebrates V-J Day on September 2nd when Japan formally surrendered, when the signing of the Japanese Instrument of Current took place on board of the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay, thus officially ending World War II. </dc:description>
