  <abstract>The de Havilland Vampire was a British fighter jet which was developed during World War II. It was the first single engine jet fighter to enter service in the Royal Air Force (RAF). It made its maiden flight in September 1943 before officially entering service in April 1946, months after World War II ended. The Vampire remained in front-line service with the Royal Air Force until 1953, which there after it was used in secondary missions such as ground attack missions and pilot training. In 1966, it was officially retired. The de Havilland Vampire in the photograph (with serial # VT873), was delivered to the RAF on March 18, 1948 and was written damaged beyond repair (in a crash or another type of accident) on December 21, 1948.</abstract>
