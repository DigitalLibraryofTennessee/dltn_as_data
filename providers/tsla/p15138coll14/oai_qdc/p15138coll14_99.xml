<dc:title>Bedford County Courthouse Second Floor plan</dc:title>
<dc:description>On December 19, 1934, the Bedford County Courthouse burned due to conflict between angry mob and State National Guard. The 1873 building burned but was not destroyed completely. By March of 1935, the county court hired the architectural firm of Marr &amp; Holman to rebuild. Marr &amp; Holman used the surviving brick walls and foundation to repair and strengthen the building. These original hand-drawn plans reflect the original portion of walls and other elements that survived the fire, including includes the steel girder system of the attic to support the clock tower that was also replaced. The project was completed by 1936.</dc:description>
