<dc:description>William Henry Goodloe (September 20, 1844-February 5, 1940) was one of thirteen children belonging to Mr. and Mrs. John Calvin Goodloe.  When the Civil War broke out, Goodloe's father offered to send him to a university in England if he would not fight in the war.  Goodloe refused and joined up with the Confederates under the command of Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest.  He surrived the war and, in 1871, he married Miss Emma Sperry Walsh.  They had several children.  Goodloe's obituary notes that he "was buried in his Rebel uniform."</dc:description>
