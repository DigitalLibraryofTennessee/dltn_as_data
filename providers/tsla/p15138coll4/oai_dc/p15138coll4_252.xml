<dc:description>D. W. Griffith's "Birth of a Nation" was based on Thomas Dixon's novel "The Clansman," and featured a highly romanticized and specious portrayal of the period of Reconstruction that followed the Civil War. The film pioneered new film-making techniques, such as close ups, deep focus, and jump cuts. The highest grossing film of all time until 1937, its popularity helped cause a resurgence of the KKK in response to the Klan's positive portrayal in the film.</dc:description>
