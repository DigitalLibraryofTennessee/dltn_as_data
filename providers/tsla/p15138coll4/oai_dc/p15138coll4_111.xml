<dc:description>Point Park was completed in 1905 to commemorate the "Battle Above the Clouds" as part of the Chickamauga-Chattanooga National Military Park. Land on the mountainside, acquired by the publisher of the Chattanooga Times, Adolph S. Ochs, from the families of Col. Whiteside and Robert Cravens comprised a significant portion of the Chickamauga-Chattanooga National Military Park on Lookout Mountain, although it is not technically part of Point Park.</dc:description>
