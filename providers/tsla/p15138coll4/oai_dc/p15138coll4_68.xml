<dc:description>A face-off at Columbia led to a brief Southern victory in the Franklin-Nashville struggle in late November 1864.  Confederate Gen. Hood set up a diversion to cut off the Federal army's line of communications with Nashville.; Federal Gen. Schofield correctly interpreted Hood's moves, but bad weather kept him from crossing to the north bank, leaving Columbia to the Confederates. Thus Schofield slowed Hood's movement but could not stop him.</dc:description>
