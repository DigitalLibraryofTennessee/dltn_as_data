<dc:description>The McGavock Confederate Cemetery is the nation's largest private Confederate cemetery.  Located on 2 acres of the Carnton plantation in Franklin, Tennessee, the cemetery is the burial site for 1481 Confederates killed at the Battle of Franklin. (Carnton served as a field hospital during the 1864 Battle.)  Residents John and Carrie McGavock's concern for the remains led to the setting aside of the land and the reinterment of the soldiers in 1866.</dc:description>
