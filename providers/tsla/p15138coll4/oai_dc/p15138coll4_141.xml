<dc:description>M. E. Y. is believed to be Mary Elizabeth Young. She was a North Carolina relative of Gerald Howard Branch, residing in Davidson, North Carolina, and married to Alfred B. Young. Cockades or rosettes generally consisted of knots of ribbons.  Used during the Revolution by the Continental Army to designate officers, by the 1860s cockades were used as an emblem of support for Confederate secession. They could be worn by men, women, or children.  Federal cockades (rosettes) were also common.</dc:description>
