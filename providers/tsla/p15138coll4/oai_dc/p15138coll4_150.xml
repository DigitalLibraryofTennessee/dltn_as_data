<dc:description>A crowd of 3,000 people witnessed the unveiling and dedication of Murfreesboro's Confederate Monument on the Court Square.  Senator William B. Bate and Governor Benton McMillin attended the ceremony.  The monument honors the valor of those Confederates who died at the Battle of Murfreesboro and other engagements in the vicinity.  It was funded by the early efforts of the Monument Association and furthered by the work of the Daughters of the Confederacy and the Palmer Bivouac.</dc:description>
