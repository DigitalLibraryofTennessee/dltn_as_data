<dc:description>In 1901 a national Confederate reunion took place on this ground; after that the land sat empty until 1908, when the park opened as "a memorial to the South."  It has changed many times: the Jefferson Davis statue was erected in 1964;;  a monument to the Battle of Memphis was added in 2008.</dc:description>
