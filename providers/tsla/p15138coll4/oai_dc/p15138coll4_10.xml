<dc:description>In 1890, the Tennessee Confederate Soldiers' Home opened on the grounds of the Hermitage Plantation, former residence of Andrew Jackson. The Soldiers' Home provided care and housing for aging Confederate veterans who resided in Tennessee. The home closed in 1933 and was demolished by 1936.  Its bricks were used to build a gift shop at the Hermitage.</dc:description>
