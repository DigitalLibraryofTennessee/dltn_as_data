<dc:description>The National Military Park was established on December 27, 1894, partly at the request of local farmers, who were tired of their pigs rooting up the remains of fallen soldiers and wanted the federal government to do something about it.; Oversight was transferred from the War Department to the National Park Service on August 10, 1933.</dc:description>
