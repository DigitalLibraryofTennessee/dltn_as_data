<dc:description>The monument was erected November 30, 1899, by Franklin Chapter 14 of the United Daughters of the Confederacy.  Although the Franklin battlefield was small, casualties (particularly Confederate casualties) were high.; Federal casualties amounted to 2,500 men; Confederate casualties were nearly three times that number (7,000 soldiers).  Fifteen of 28 Confederate generals were lost in the battle.</dc:description>
