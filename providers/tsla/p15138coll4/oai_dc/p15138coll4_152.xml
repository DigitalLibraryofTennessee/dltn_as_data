<dc:description>McClure's Magazine was founded in 1893 and is often compared to Atlantic Monthly.  It is credited with creating "muckraking" journalism.  Ida M. Tarbell was an author best known for her book "The History of Standard Oil," which is given some of the credit for the Federal antitrust action against Standard Oil.  A leading "muckraker," Tarbell often wrote for McClure's and The Standard.  George Varian was an illustrator known for his works featuring American Western themes.</dc:description>
