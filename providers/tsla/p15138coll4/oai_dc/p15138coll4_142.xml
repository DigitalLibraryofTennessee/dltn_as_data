<dc:description>Built between 1851 and 1853, this hotel served many river travelers and stayed in business until the 1930s.  This site of the February 16, 1862, surrender of Brig. Gen. Simon B. Buckner to Maj. Gen. U.S. Grant marked the first major victory for Union forces.  Thirteen thousand Confederate prisoners left this location bound for Northern prisons. The Association and the National Park Service completed the restoration of the House in the 1970s.</dc:description>
