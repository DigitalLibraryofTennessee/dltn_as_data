<dc:description>The Battle of Chickamauga was fought in September 1863 between the armies of Braxton Bragg and William Rosecrans.  After days of hard fighting the Confederate Army drove Rosecrans from the field but failed to achieve lasting success.; The battle was fought in parts of Tennessee and Georgia and on the farming properties of many citizens.  Part of the battle was fought on "Poe Field," on the property of Larkin H. Poe.  The Georgia monument stands across the road from this site.</dc:description>
