<dc:description>In 1863 Federal and Confederate forces fought for control of Chattanooga, the gateway to the deep South. The Confederates had been victorious at nearby Chickamauga in September, but renewed fighting in Chattanooga in November gave Federal troops final control. Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park, the nations first, was created in 1890 to preserve and commemorate these battlefields.</dc:description>
