<dc:description>Charles Henry Niehaus (1855-1935) sculpted the Forrest Monument, which was erected in 1905 in Forrest Park.  Niehaus completed at least thirty Civil War monuments during his lifetime. The 1901 United Confederate Veterans Reunion in Memphis provides the best example of the city's devotion to the Lost Cause; this celebration also represented the last great gathering of Civil War veterans. Forrest died in 1877, and he and his wife were buried in Forrest Park.</dc:description>
