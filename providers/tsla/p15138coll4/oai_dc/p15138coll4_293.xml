<dc:description>In 1914 Tennessee State Archivist Gus Dyer developed a questionnaire and contacted all known Tennessee Civil War Veterans in an effort to record their experiences before, during, and after the war.  In 1920 the project was continued by then State Libriarian and Archivist John Trotwood Moore and the Tennessee Historical Commission.  By conclusion of the program in 1922, 1,650 completed forms had been returned and were made available for research.</dc:description>
