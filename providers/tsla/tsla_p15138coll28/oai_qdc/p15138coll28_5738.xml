<dc:title>Mrs. Polk Chapleau calling her fox hounds.</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pearl Margaret Polk Chapleau was an accomplished foxhunter from Memphis, TN. She was born in 1887 to Oscar Bowles Polk and Ada Clarissa Boyle of Hickory Valley, Hardeman County, TN. She was an accomplished figure in the Southern and Gulf Coast foxhunting circuit. Chapleau maintained between 20-25 purebred hounds on her family plantation in Hardeman County, TN. She worked with the American Kennel Club, Gulf Coast Foxhunters&#8217; Association, Tri-State Foxhunters Association and the Southern States Foxhunters Association. Chapleau&#8217;s accomplishments stand out as woman working within a predominantly male field and sport. Mrs. Polk Chapleau was married to Charles Emory Chapleau from Philadelphia, PA. The couple had one son, Oscar Polk Chapleau. Pearl died in 1967 and is buried in Hickory Valley, Hardeman County.</dc:description>
