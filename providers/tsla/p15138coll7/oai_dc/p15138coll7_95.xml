<dc:description>Civilian Conservation Corps Company 1456 was formed on May 29, 1933.  It helped fight and prevent forest fires.  It also built a five-mile-long gravel road which gave an outlet to three hundred previously isolated people.  The camp was later named Camp Folsom Angel to honor the first soldier from Carter County killed in World War I.</dc:description>
