<dc:description>Bledsoe State Forest is located on the Cumberland Plateau in east-central Tennessee, in Bledsoe, Cumberland, Van Buren, and White Counties. In 1934, a Civilian Conservation Corps (C. C. C.) camp [1466] was established and remained; on the forest until 1940. Several buildings, roads, and trails were constructed during this time. The C. C. C. planted hundreds of thousands of trees which make up many of the pine stands that you see on the forest today.</dc:description>
