<dc:description>With the purpose of relieving unemployment, the Civilian Conservation Corps was created in 1933, and was expanded by Congress in 1937.  During this expansion, the Civilian Conservation Corps added vocation training and remedial education programs.  The Corps employed young men to perform structural improvements to bridges and roads; erosion and flood control; and various conservation work projects.  The Corps was instrumental in the infrastructure of the Tennessee State Parks System and National Parks in Tennessee.  The T. O. Fuller State Park was established as a segregated park.  It is famous for such Native American archaeological sites as Fuller Mounds.</dc:description>
