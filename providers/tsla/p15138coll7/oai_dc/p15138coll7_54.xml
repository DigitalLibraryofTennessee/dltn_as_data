<dc:description>This arm patch reflects some of the areas of emphasis of the Civilian Conservation Corps work.  In this case, forestry, conservation, surveying, and mapping are all suggested by the design of the patch.  This patch stands separate from the Civilian Conservation Corps insignia patch, the Company-specific patches, and those chevron or stripe patches worn to designate a rank within the Civilian Conservation Corps.</dc:description>
