<dc:description>Upon enlisting in the Civilian Conservation Corps you're supposed to stay 6 months, and most stayed 6 months.  They were supposed to discharge a camp member after 2 years.  Because of the work he was doing and his position as Civilian Conservation Corps camp assistant, which was a civil service job, he was able to stay in for five years.  During his civil service he no longer stayed at the camp but worked there and was still in the Civilian Conservation Corps.  Also comments that some individuals, like Frank Sinatra, stayed briefly in the Civilian Conservation Corps and left due to lack of interest.</dc:description>

<dc:description>With the purpose of relieving unemployment, the Civilian Conservation Corps was created in 1933, and was expanded by Congress in 1937.  During this expansion, the Civilian Conservation Corps added vocation training and remedial education programs.  The Corps employed young men to perform structural improvements to bridges and roads; erosion and flood control; and various conservation work projects.  The Corps was instrumental in the infrastructure of the Tennessee State Parks System and National Parks in Tennessee.</dc:description>
