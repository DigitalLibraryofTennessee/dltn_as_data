<dc:description>Big Ridge Park is a heavily forested, 3,687-acre park which lies on the southern shore of Tennessee Valley Authority's Norris Reservoir, approximately 25 miles north of Knoxville.  It was one of five demonstration parks developed by the Tennessee Valley Authority in cooperation with the National Park Service and the Civilian Conservation Corps (C. C. C.) as an example of public recreation development along Tennessee Valley Authority lakeshores. The structures on the park reflect the craftsmanship and stonework of the Civilian Conservation Corps.</dc:description>
