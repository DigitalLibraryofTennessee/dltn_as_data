<dc:description>Hobart Parrish describing how aware he was of the conditions in the Great Depression and the New Deal.  He saw pictures from New York or Pittsburgh of people in soup lines.  In his area they were unable to sell produce but mostly raised their own food. They only had to buy certain items (like salt and black pepper) from peddling wagons.  The Depression made it difficult to make money, but didn't impact rural areas in the same manner as it did in the towns.</dc:description>

<dc:description>With the purpose of relieving unemployment, the Civilian Conservation Corps was created in 1933, and was expanded by Congress in 1937.  During this expansion, the Civilian Conservation Corps added vocation training and remedial education programs.  The Corps employed young men to perform structural improvements to bridges and roads; erosion and flood control; and various conservation work projects.  The Corps was instrumental in the infrastructure of the Tennessee State Parks System and National Parks in Tennessee.</dc:description>
