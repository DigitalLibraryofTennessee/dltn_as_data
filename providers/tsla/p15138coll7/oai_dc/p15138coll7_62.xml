<dc:description>Parrish's camp was constructed outside the city limits at the time, but would be inside the city limits today.  They could walk to town and go to movies.  He also attended night school at Clarksville High School, which was permitted in the Civilian Conservation Corps.  Some Civilian Conservation Corps men went to Austin Peay as well.  He also took courses given at the camp, such as engineering, soil conservation, mechanics, blacksmithing, or forestry.  He mostly took engineering classes.  Civilian Conservation Corps leaders also taught crews about how to prevent erosion.</dc:description>

<dc:description>With the purpose of relieving unemployment, the Civilian Conservation Corps was created in 1933, and was expanded by Congress in 1937.  During this expansion, the Civilian Conservation Corps added vocation training and remedial education programs.  The Corps employed young men to perform structural improvements to bridges and roads; erosion and flood control; and various conservation work projects.  The Corps was instrumental in the infrastructure of the Tennessee State Parks System and National Parks in Tennessee.</dc:description>
