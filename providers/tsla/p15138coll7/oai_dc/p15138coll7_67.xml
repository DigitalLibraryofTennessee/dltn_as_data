<dc:description>The Civilian Conservation Corps did the initial development of the Pickett State Forest site following the donation of the 12,000 acres to the state by Stearns Coal and Lumber Company in 1933.  Between 1934 and 1942, hiking trails, cabins, a lodge, a ranger station, and a 12-acre lake were put in place.  Much native sandstone rock was used by the Civilian Conservation Corps in building construction. Civilian Conservation Corps employees quarried the stone from the area.  The Park appears on the National Register of Historic Places.</dc:description>
