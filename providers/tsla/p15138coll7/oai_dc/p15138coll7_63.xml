<dc:description>Parrish states that he believes when the Civilian Conservation Corps first ecamped outside Clarksville the locals were a taken aback by their presence, but after a while they became accepted, and locals even provided them lunch.  They eventually became a soil conservation service camp.  Their original camp number, SCS8, reflects this.  The camp's forestry number had been P63 when they were a forestry camp.  Camps were numbered according to the kind of work the camp specialized in.</dc:description>

<dc:description>With the purpose of relieving unemployment, the Civilian Conservation Corps was created in 1933, and was expanded by Congress in 1937.  During this expansion, the Civilian Conservation Corps added vocation training and remedial education programs.  The Corps employed young men to perform structural improvements to bridges and roads; erosion and flood control; and various conservation work projects.  The Corps was instrumental in the infrastructure of the Tennessee State Parks System and National Parks in Tennessee.</dc:description>
