<dc:description>Hobart Parrish describing what attracted him to join the Civilian Conservation Corps.  He could get an education, earn money, and learn a trade.  It was difficult to go to college, and he felt he would get the same preparation in the Civilian Conservation Corps taking their training in various trades. He also felt that if he did want to go to college he would be able to save money he made and could afford it.  He also comments on the amounts of pay he received in Civilian Conservation Corps, how much he was given and how much the Civilian Conservation Corps sent home to his family.</dc:description>

<dc:description>With the purpose of relieving unemployment, the Civilian Conservation Corps was created in 1933, and was expanded by Congress in 1937.  During this expansion, the Civilian Conservation Corps added vocation training and remedial education programs.  The Corps employed young men to perform structural improvements to bridges and roads; erosion and flood control; and various conservation work projects.  The Corps was instrumental in the infrastructure of the Tennessee State Parks System and National Parks in Tennessee.</dc:description>
