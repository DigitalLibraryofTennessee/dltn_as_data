  <abstract>Parrish states that the Tennessee Valley Authority had 40 camps, such as the ones at Pickwick and Norris Dam. Pickwick was built by Civilian Conservation Corps, but the camp was operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority. They did work the Tennessee Valley Authority needed done rather than the soil conservation work they did in regular Civilian Conservation Corps camps. Tennessee Valley Authority camps had a Tennessee Valley Authority number and an army number that stayed with them when they changed locations as long as they continued to do the same work.</abstract>

    <abstract>This unit of the Tennessee Virtual Archive features images of the work and history of the Civilian Conservation Corps in Tennessee.  Created in 1933 by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to preserve and nurture America’s natural resources, the CCC brought forests back from the brink of destruction, established recreational destinations, and provided work for tens of thousands of young men from the Volunteer state.  Approximately three million American men, including more than 75,000 Tennesseans, enrolled in the program.  The legacy of the CCC, which was dissolved as the country entered World War II, endured in the lives of the men who served in its ranks and in the improvements made to the nation’s physical landscape...</abstract>
