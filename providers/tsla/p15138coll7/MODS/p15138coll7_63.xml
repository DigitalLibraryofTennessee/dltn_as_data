  <abstract>Parrish states that he believes when the Civilian Conservation Corps first ecamped outside Clarksville the locals were a taken aback by their presence, but after a while they became accepted, and locals even provided them lunch. They eventually became a soil conservation service camp. Their original camp number, SCS8, reflects this. The camp's forestry number had been P63 when they were a forestry camp. Camps were numbered according to the kind of work the camp specialized in.</abstract>

Approximately three million American men, including more than 75,000 Tennesseans, enrolled in the program.  The legacy of the CCC, which was dissolved as the country entered World War II, endured in the lives of the men who served in its ranks and in the improvements made to the nation’s physical landscape...</abstract>
