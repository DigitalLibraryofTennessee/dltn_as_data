<dc:description>Following the Battle of Chickamauga, Lookout Mountain was garrisoned by the Confederate Army of Tennessee under Braxton Bragg.  The Battle of Lookout Mountain in 1863 pushed the Confederates east and south, and the mountain remained in Federal hands until the war's end.  The soldiers pictured appear to be in Federal dress, so it can be assumed the photograph was taken after 1863.</dc:description>
