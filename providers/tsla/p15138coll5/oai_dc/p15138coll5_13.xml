<dc:description>An officer in the 20th Tennessee Infantry, Smith fought at Mill Springs, Shiloh, Baton Rouge, Stones River, Chickamauga, Atlanta, Dalton to Jonesborough, Franklin, Nashville, and Murfreesboro. He was promoted to brigadier general in 1864, suggesting the portrait must be pre-1864.  Captured at the Battle of Nashville, he suffered long-term psychological damage stemming from a beating he received following his capture.  He spent the last 47 years of his life in an insane asylum in Nashville.</dc:description>
