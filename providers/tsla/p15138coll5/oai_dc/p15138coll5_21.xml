<dc:description>During the Civil War, hundreds of hospitals were established in cities and towns in both the North and the South. Some were specifically designed and built for that purpose, but others occupied existing buildings taken over for hospital use. Conditions in Civil War hospitals were grim and overcrowded, particularly after battles. Diseases spread rapidly, even though soldiers with contagious illnesses were separated from those who were wounded.</dc:description>
