<dc:description>Following the Battle of Chickamauga, Lookout Mountain was garrisoned by the Confederate Army of Tennessee under Braxton Bragg.  The Battle of Lookout Mountain in 1863 pushed the Confederates east and south, and the mountain then remained in Federal hands until the war's end.  General Grant commanded the Federal victories at Lookout Mountain and Missionary Ridge on November 24-25 and drove the Confederates from their siege of Chattanooga.</dc:description>
