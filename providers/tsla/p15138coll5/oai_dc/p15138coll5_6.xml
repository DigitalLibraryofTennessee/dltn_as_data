<dc:description>McNairy was killed in the "Second Battle of Fort Donelson," the February 3, 1863, event when 2500 Confederate troops under Major General Joseph Wheeler attacked a small garrison (800 men) at Dover, Tennessee, under Colonel A.C. Harding. The Confederate failure to capture the garrison left Federals in control of Middle Tennessee.  Nathan Bedford Forrest denounced Wheeler after this battle and refused to serve under him again.</dc:description>
