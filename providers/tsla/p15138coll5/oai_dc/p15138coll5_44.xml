<dc:description>The Battle of Lookout Mountain or the "Battle Above the Clouds," commenced on November 24, 1863, with General Braxton Bragg's Confederate forces in possession of Lookout Mountain.  Before daylight the next morning, and in opposition to the wishes of commander General Ulysses S. Grant, Federal volunteers scaled the cliffs of the Palisades, found the Confederates had withdrawn, and claimed Lookout Mountain.  The rock was named after U. S. Sergeant Roper, who fell to his death there.</dc:description>
