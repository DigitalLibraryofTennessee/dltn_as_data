<dc:description>Located on the south corner of West Side Square, the Northern Bank of Alabama is pictured flying the United States flag after occupation by Federal troops.  Federl troops first seized Huntsville on April 11, 1862, but were forced to retreat several months later. During the autumn of 1863, occupation forces settled in for the duration of the war.  Huntsville escaped large-scale damage because it functioned as a Federal base of operations and housed segments of the Federal Army.</dc:description>
