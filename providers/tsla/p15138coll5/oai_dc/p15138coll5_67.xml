<dc:description>The Battle of Hoover's Gap was the opening battle of the Tullahoma Campaign. On June 24, 1863, Union General Williams Rosecrans, hoping to capitalize on the victory at Stones River, dispatched forces to Hoover's Gap. There, the Federals-including John T. Wilder's Lightning Brigade-quickly drove the defenders out. Fighting continued until June 26.</dc:description>
