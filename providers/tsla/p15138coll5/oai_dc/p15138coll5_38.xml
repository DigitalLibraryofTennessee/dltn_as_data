<dc:description>After the defeat of the U.S. Army at the Battle of Chickamauga, President Lincoln sent General Hooker with forces to help break the Confederate siege of Chattanooga. General Grant and General George Thomas joined to help establish a new supply line. Hooker took Lookout Valley as Thomas prepared to break out of Chattanooga. Hooker then took Lookout Mountain and continued to pursue retreating Confederates.  He remained headquartered in Lookout Valley until the Atlanta Campaign in May 1864.</dc:description>
