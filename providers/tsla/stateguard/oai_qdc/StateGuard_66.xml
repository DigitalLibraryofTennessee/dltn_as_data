<dc:title>If You Aren't In The ARMY Why Aren't You In The Tennessee State Guard?</dc:title>
<dc:description>Uniformed Tennessee State Guard member with rifle in hand with a backdrop of a manufacturing plant and railroad.  There is listed the criteria for enlistment and the individuals to contact, along with businesses and individuals who paid for the advertisement.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Promotions like this appeared in newspapers across the state beginning in the summer of 1943.  Their placement heralded an entlistment drive; the Tennessee State Guard forces continued to lose their younger trained members to the Regular Army.  A frequently mentioned membership goal was 10,000; the Guard averaged 7,800 during the major periods of military hostility, but experienced a constant drain.  The promotions were also used as an opportunity to address common criticisms.</dc:description>
