  <abstract>Newspaper clipping featureing Seventh Regiment personnel who participated in the first large-scale maneuvers for the Tennessee State Guard that were held in Cookeville August 13-15, 1943. The two photographs contrast the types and ages of men who were members of the Tennessee State Guard, from the young sixteen year-olds to the middle-aged. Also highlighted are the benefits the young men will receive from Guard membership in the Regular Army with this pre-induction training.</abstract>
  <abstract>This clipping points up the involvement in the Tennessee State Guard, not only of those deemed too old to serve in the Regular Army, but those young men who considered it beneficial and patriotic service. Indeed, the age of those eligible for service in the Guard was lowered to accommodate those desiring membership. The first high school unit of the Tennessee State Guard formed in early 1943 at Gainesboro's Central High School.</abstract>
