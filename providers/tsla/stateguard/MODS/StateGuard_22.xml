  <abstract>Regimental parade through the business district of Cookeville after the maneuvers were completed. The parade was under the direction of the regimental adjutant, Captain Henry Frank Carlen.</abstract>
  <abstract>Members of the Seventh Regiment of the Tennessee State Guard participated in the first large-scale maneuvers of the organization held in Cookeville. Most of the maneuvers took place on the farm of Captain Joe Scott. The maneuvers included simulated paratroop landings. Several planes of the Civilian Air Patrol also participated in the maneuvers. The maneuvers were declared a success and proved the State Guard could handle a major defense problem.</abstract>
