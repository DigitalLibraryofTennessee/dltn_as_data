  <abstract>Prentice Cooper served three consective terms as Tennessee's fourty-fourth governor (1939-1945). Notably, he led a tireless drive to mobilize the state for World War II. This effort would come to include organizing the State Defense Council, forming the Tennessee State Guard, overseeing the state's vast war industries, and constructing fifteen armories and numerous large military bases. He was the Commander-in-Chief of the Tennessee State Guard, and he would remain actively involved in their operations.</abstract>
