  <abstract>This patriotic newspaper cartoon/promotion for the Guard appearing in the Williamson County News features in the upper right-hand corner an image of a shadowy,helmeted soldier with his weapon raised. The accompanying text emphasizes the wide range of ages that are welcome, the enlistment period, the drill expectations, and the benefit that the State Guard could be to those who later find themselves in the Regular Army.</abstract>
  <abstract>Cartoons and promotions like this appeared in newspapers across the state beginning in the summer of 1943. Their placement heralded an enlistment drive; the Tennessee Guard forces continued to lose their younger trained members to the Regular Army. A frequently mentioned membership goal was 10,000; the Guard averaged 7,800 during the major periods of military hostility, but experienced a constant drain. The cartoons and promotions were also used as a public relations tool to address criticisms.</abstract>
