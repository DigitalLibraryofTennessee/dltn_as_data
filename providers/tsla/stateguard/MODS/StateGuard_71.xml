  <abstract>Brigadier General Smith, Major General Pritchard, Major General Roderick R. Allen, Brigadier General Jacob McGavock Dickinson and other unnamed officers from the Tennessee State Guard observing firepower demonstrations from the sidelines. The officers sit in a designated area marked with rope. Other military personnel sit in the background on bleachers.</abstract>
  <abstract>Construction began on the wartime training camp known as Camp Campbell on January 12, 1942. The initial determination to designate Tennessee as the official address of the camp due to its nearness to Clarksville was reversed on September 23, 1942, and Kentucky became its official state of address. Camp Campbell trained and supported numerous military units during World War II and encompassed 102,414 acres. Its status changed to permanent military installation in 1950, and its name changed to Fort Campbell.</abstract>
