  <abstract>Letter dated March 10, 1943 from Fred J. Bertorelli, Brigadier-General of the First Infantry Brigade of the Tennessee State Guard (TSG), to Gov. Prentice Cooper. The letter is most noteworthy for the TSG emblem illustrated at the top of the letter.</abstract>
  <abstract>The Tennessee State Guard was formed in 1941 to serve as the state's volunteer military force after the Tennessee National Guard had been federalized for service in World War II. With the governor functioning as Commander-in-Chief, the State Guard's duties involved maintaining order, acting as an anti-sabotage unit, assisting during domestic and natural emergencies, cooperating with local and federal military authorities, and performing assigned armed forces duty in the state.</abstract>
