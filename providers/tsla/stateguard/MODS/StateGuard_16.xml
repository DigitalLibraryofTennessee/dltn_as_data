  <abstract>Tennesse State Guard officers who attended military training at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia in 1942. There are approximately forty-three officers in the photograph.</abstract>
  <abstract>In October of 1942, it was arranged that approximately 100 of the State Guard's 650 officers would be sent to Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia for training. The officers left on October 17th and returned at the end of the month. The Tennessee State Guard was the first unit of its kind to be extended the facilities of the United States Army and to receive training under Army officers. While the training took place, Governor Prentice Cooper made an inspection tour. With this exercise, Tennessee became the first state to pay state guardsmen for their services.</abstract>
