  <abstract>The Army Day Parade in front of the Tennessee State Capitol. Many people are lining the street watching the men on motorcycles and other marchers as they drive and walk by.</abstract>
  <abstract>The parade marshal for the Army Day Parade was Col. H. H. Corson of the Tennessee State Guard. He and his motorcycle escort led the army units with 900 infantrymen, bands, and artillery attachments. Various other military organizations participated in the event. The parade marched in front of Gov. Prentice Cooper and what newspapers called the "biggest Nashville crowd in years." Planes from the Vultee plant and Civil Air Patrol flew over downtown Nashville.</abstract>
