  <abstract>Caricatures of Emperor Hirohito of Japan, Adolph Hitler of Germany, and Benito Mussolini of Italy are employed in this Tennessee State Guard promotion to remind Murfreesboro Daily News Journal readers that American apathy and "laying down on the job" are assets to our foes. Readers are encouraged to enlist and assured that they furnish nothing and that this is not a step into the Regular Army.</abstract>
  <abstract>Cartoons and promotions like this appeared in newspapers across the state beginning in the summer of 1943. Their placement heralded a recruiting drive; the Tennessee State Guard forces continued to lose their younger trained members to the Regular Army. A frequently mentioned membership goal was 10,000; the Guard averaged 7,800 during the major periods of military hostility, but experienced a constant drain.The cartoons and promotions were also used as an opportunity to address common criticisms.</abstract>
