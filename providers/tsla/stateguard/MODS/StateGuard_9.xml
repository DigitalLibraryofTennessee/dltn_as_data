  <abstract>Army Day Parade in front of the Tennessee State Capitol. This event featured the 2nd Tennessee Infantry on parade in downtown Nashville. Many people are lining the street watching the jeep vehicle as the individuals inside salute as they ride by. Two large buildings connected by a street can be seen in the background.</abstract>
  <abstract>The Tennessee State Guard was formed in 1941 to serve as the state's voluntee force after the Tennessee National Guard had been federalized for service in World War II. With the governor functioning as Commander-in-Chief, the State Guard's duties involved maintaining order, acting as an anti-sabotage unit, assisting during domestic and natural emergencies, cooperating with local and federal military authorities, and performing assigned armed forces duty in the state.</abstract>
