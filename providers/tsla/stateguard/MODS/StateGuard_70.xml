  <abstract>Four sixteen-year-olds who are gaining experience for when they attain regular Army age are shown with a twenty-six-year-old machine gun trooper. This photograph was taken during the Seventh Regiment's Large-Scale Maneuvers which took place in Cookeville, Tennessee. These young men were chosen at random from a crowd of some seven hundred enlisted men assembled at the Cookeville armory.</abstract>
  <abstract>Members of the Seventh Regiment of the Tennessee State Guard participated in the first large-scale maneuvers of the organization held in Cookeville. Most of the maneuvers took place on the farm of Captain Joe Scott. The maneuvers included simulated paratroop landings. Several planes of the Civilian Air Patrol also participated in the maneuvers. The maneuvers were declared a success and proved the State Guard could handle a major defense problem.</abstract>
