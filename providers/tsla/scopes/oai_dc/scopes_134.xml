<dc:description>John Trotwood Moore had a high-profile at the time this letter was written.  He was not only a well-known man of letters, but at this time, he was serving as the Tennessee State Librarian and Archivist, a position he held from 1919; until his death in 1929. This letter does highlight the national interest that was focused on Tennessee and the evolution debate following the passage of the Butler Bill and leading up to the Scopes Trial.</dc:description>
