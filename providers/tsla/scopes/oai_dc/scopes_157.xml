<dc:description>Near the conclusion of the Scopes Trial, attorney Clarence Darrow asked the jury to return a verdict of guilty in order that the case might be appealed to the Tennessee Supreme Court. The jury complied with Darrow's request; and Judge Raulston laid down a fine of $100.00. According to the Tennessee Supreme Court, the fine should have been set by the jury, not the judge, and the case was thereby dismissed.</dc:description>
