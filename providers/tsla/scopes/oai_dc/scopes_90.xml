<dc:description>Prosecutor William Jennings Bryan, aged 65 years, posed for this photograph in the courtroom during the Scopes Trial.  The photograph suggests the physical strain on Bryan produced by the oppressive heat of the courtroom.  To counter the heat, Bryan; regularly removed his suit jacket, tie, and shirt collar. Although Bryan had trained as an attorney, he had not practiced law in over three decades.  Instead he had served in public office and as a lecturer.</dc:description>
