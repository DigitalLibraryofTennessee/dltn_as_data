<dc:source>Governor Austin Peay's Papers, 1923-1927</dc:source>
<dc:description>This circular contained within Governor Austin Peay's Papers exemplifies the mass interest in the arguments over evolutionary theory that would swirl around Tennessee in 1925.  When the Tennessee General Assembly passed and Governor Austin Peay signed; the Butler Bill making it illegal to teach evolution in the state of Tennessee, the stage was set for the ACLU challenge of the constitutionality of the act in Dayton, Tennessee at the trial of biology teacher John T. Scopes.</dc:description>
