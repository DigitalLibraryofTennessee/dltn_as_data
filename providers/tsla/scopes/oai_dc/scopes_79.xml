<dc:description>In Dayton, advocates for both sides of the trial began to gather.  The town's business owners seized on the upcoming trial's central issue, humankind's alleged evolutionary link to primates.  The citizens got down to "monkey business," decorating shops; and automobiles with images of apes and chimpanzees.  Live monkeys seemed to materialize out of nowhere, including trained chimpanzees rented or purchased by publicity-hungry business owners.</dc:description>
