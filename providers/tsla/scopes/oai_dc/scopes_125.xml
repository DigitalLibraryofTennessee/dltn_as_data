<dc:description>A Civic Biology was one of the most widely used Biology textbooks of its time.  John T. Scopes used this edition of the text to teach evolution prior to the "Monkey Trial" in Dayton, Tennessee, in 1925.  Hunter's text espoused the belief in a racial hierarchy of the world's population.  White, Anglo-Saxons were situated at the superior position in this hierarchy and Africans were at the bottom.  Such beleifs fueled the Eugenics movement which discouraged reproduction among the inferior races.</dc:description>
