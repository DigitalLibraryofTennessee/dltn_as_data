<dc:description>Anticipating more visitors for the trial than the courtroom could hold, Rhea County officials installed benches and an outdoor speaker system on the courthouse lawn.  Local townspeople hung a banner on the courthouse wall saying "Read Your Bible." After cracks appeared in the courtroom ceiling, the judge moved the proceedings outside. The move occurred on July 20, 1925, before the famous cross-examination of Bryan by defense attorney Clarence Darrow.</dc:description>
