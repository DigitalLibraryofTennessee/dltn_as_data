<dc:description>As expected, the jury convicted John Scopes of violating Tennessee's law against teaching evolution.  In his final comments to the jury, defense attorney Clarence Darrow urged jurors to convict his client so that the defense could appeal the case to; a higher court.  The jury complied after deliberating only a few minutes.  Conviction carried a fine of $100 to $500 dollars, which the "Baltimore Sun" offered to pay for Scopes.</dc:description>
