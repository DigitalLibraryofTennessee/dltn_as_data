<dc:description>Letter to Governor Austin Peay (1923-1927) from Noel Gaines, a Kentucky citizen, praising  Governor Peay and the Tennessee Legislature for the passage of the anti-evolution law (the Butler Act).  He takes the Kenucky Legislature to task for not passing; similar legislation in his home state. In his rant, Mr. Gaines says the majority of science educators are "rank infidels, atheists, materialists, teaching a line of destruction."</dc:description>

<dc:description>In response to the letter above, Governor Peay wrote on August 21, 1925, "My dear Mr. Gaines: It has been exasperating to submit to the bizarre publicity toward this state on account of the anti-evolution bill, but I have not been worried about it; because I do not want my state aligned with the radical and impious influences that arrayed themselves against me.  What you say in your letter is well believed from my own observation.  With very kind regards to you, I remain, Respectfully, Governor."</dc:description>
