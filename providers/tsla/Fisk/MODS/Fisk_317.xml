  <abstract>Fisk University is a private historically black university in Nashville, Tennessee. The university was founded in 1866, six months after the end of the Civil War, and named after General Clinton B. Fisk as the “Fisk Free Colored School.” General Clinton B. Fisk was a senior officer in the Freedmen’s Bureau, who donated a former Union Army barracks to the school. A year later the school became Fisk University, with support from the Protestant-based abolitionist group American Missionary Association (AMA.) Fisk University is the oldest institution of higher learning in Nashville, Tennessee.</abstract>
