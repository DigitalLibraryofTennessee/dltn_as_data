  <abstract>Displays routes and distances of major cities from the departure point of the stage from Abingdon, Virginia. Smaller towns and communities near those cities are also listed with the additional mileage that would be required to reach them. These distances would then be used to calculate the cost of transportation. Advertisement for John M'Cormick's house of ENTERTAINMENT appears at the bottom of the bill. Handwritten figures on the broadside probably represent a calculation of price.</abstract>

These ephemera were often produced in mass quantities to advertise, promote or announce official proclamations, public meetings, and entertainment events.
