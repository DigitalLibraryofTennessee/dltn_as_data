<dc:description>Mrs. S. A. Vaughan was a noted educator.  As she indicates in the broadside, though raised locally, she spent time in New York and had twenty years of teaching experience by this date.  She authored volumes of readers and spellers that would be published in Atlanta during the Civil War period.  She and her contemporary female-teachers-turned-authors, however, were not responsible for any upper level Confederate textbooks.</dc:description>
