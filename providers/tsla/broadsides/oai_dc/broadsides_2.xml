<dc:description>Kinemacolor was the first successful color motion picture process, used commercially from 1908 to 1914. It was invented by George Albert Smith of Brighton, England in 1906 and launched by Charles Urban's Urban Trading Co. of London in 1908. George V became King-Emperor (Emperor of India) in 1910 on the death of his father, Edward VII. The film was made in 1911.</dc:description>
