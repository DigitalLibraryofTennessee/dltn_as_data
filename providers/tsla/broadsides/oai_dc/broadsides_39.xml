<dc:description>Capers Memorial Christian Methodist Church began as the "African Mission" to the white McKendree Methodist Church. After preaching to slaves for many years, a commodious brick house was erected near Sulphur Springs for black church members. In 1851, Nashville's African American Methodists purchased a lot at Hine's and McCreary (11th Ave. North) and built a church.</dc:description>
