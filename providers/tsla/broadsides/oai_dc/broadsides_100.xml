<dc:description>Phrenology was the study of skull features made popular in the early 19th Century.  It is now largely considered to be a pseudo-science. The subject of this examination, "John A. Murril" is probably the infamous John A. Murrell, a colorful antebellum Tennessee outlaw.</dc:description>
