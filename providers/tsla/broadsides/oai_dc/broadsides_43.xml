<dc:description>The first balloon ascension took place in France in 1783.  A balloon first crossed the English Channel in 1785.  The first American flight was a 45-minute run from Philadelphia to New Jersey in the early 1900s. Balloons were also used for military purposes, serving as platforms for bomb launches during World War I.</dc:description>
