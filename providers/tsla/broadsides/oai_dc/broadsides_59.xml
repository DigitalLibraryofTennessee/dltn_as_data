<dc:description>Patent medicine is a term given to various medical or pseudo-medical compounds sold under a variety of names and labels. The term has become particularly associated with the sale of drug compounds in the nineteenth century under cover of colorful names and even more colorful claims. The promotion of patent medicines was one of the first major successes of the advertising industry, and many advertising and sales techniques were pioneered by patent medicine promoters.</dc:description>
