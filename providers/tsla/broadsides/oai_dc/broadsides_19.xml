<dc:description>This broadside reflects a popular fascination with the exotic that was intensified by the British annexation of Burma in the 1880s. Tensions had been growing between Britain and Burma since the 1840s, and the issues of multiple sovereignty in the region had created further relationship difficulties.  Britain's interests in the security of India and in Burma's raw materials and trade potential were factors that led to the establishment of British colonial authority in Burma in the 1880s.</dc:description>
