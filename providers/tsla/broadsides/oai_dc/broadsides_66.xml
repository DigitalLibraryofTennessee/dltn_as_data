<dc:description>J.B. Wilson was born in Fayetteville in 1834.  He learned the trade of cabinet-making as he worked in his father's shop from around 1850 until 1854.  He then entered into a partnership with his father and brother as undertakers and furniture makers. Wilson enlisted in the 43rd Regiment C. S. A. when the war broke out.  He picked up his trade after the war, and remained Fayetteville's leading furniture dealer and undertaker for decades.</dc:description>
