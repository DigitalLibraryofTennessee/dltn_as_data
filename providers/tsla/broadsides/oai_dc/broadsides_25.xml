<dc:description>DeLong Rice was deeply inspired when he heard Bob Taylor speak in 1888.  A business association ensued, leading to Rice's management of Taylor's lecture tours beginning in 1891.  Taylor quickly became the highest-priced professional lecturer in the country.  Rice organized his Rice Lyceum Bureau in 1900 and staged high-quality lecture and entertainment tours across the South. Such cultural events served as an educational resource for the audience.</dc:description>
