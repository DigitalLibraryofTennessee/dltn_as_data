<dc:description>"Little Blind" Maud Cook (1875-1893) was a Manchester, Tennessee, native born to Nancy Casey and Samuel Cook.  Blind from birth, she was regarded by many to be a musical prodigy, and she composed and performed her own music from an early age.  Maud's sister Pearl was also born blind.  Both young women remained small in stature throughout their lives, and both died before reaching the age of 20.</dc:description>
