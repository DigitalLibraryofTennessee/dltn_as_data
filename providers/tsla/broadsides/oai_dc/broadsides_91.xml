<dc:description>The Creek Indian tribes were disbanded and forced to come under Alabama law in 1832.  When settlers began to infringe on Creek land, the Creek Indians revolted.  Their insurrection was forcibly put down by troops under Gen. Winfield Scott and was the reason for the tribe's removal to Indian Territories west of the Mississippi.</dc:description>
