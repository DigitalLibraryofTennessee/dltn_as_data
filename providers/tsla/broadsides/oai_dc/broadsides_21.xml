<dc:description>Broadside indicates the financial need becoming evident among Tennessee's aging and ailing generation of Confederate veterans.  Legislation establishing the Tennessee Board of Pension Examiners was enacted in 1891 to handle the administration of pensions for the state's indigent, disabled, and honorably discharged Confederate veterans. Confederate widows' pensions were first issued in Tennessee in 1905.</dc:description>
