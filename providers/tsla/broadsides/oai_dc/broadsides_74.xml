<dc:description>Broadsides were often used in memorium for fallen soldiers.  This was especially true in World War I when the medium was used frequently and battlefield casualties were very high.  "Columbia" was a patriotic name for the United States used in the 18th Century and is personified here resembling the Greek goddess Athena or "Liberty" from popular French Revolution artwork (most notably Eugene Delacroix's "Liberty Leading the People.")</dc:description>
