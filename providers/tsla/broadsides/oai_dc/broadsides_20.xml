<dc:description>Twentieth century public health records for Tennessee reflect an increasing emphasis on disease prevention and the increasing state responsibility for public health and education.  Following major outbreaks of cholera and yellow fever across the state from 1832 through 1873, a State Board of Health was created for Tennessee in 1875, and many jurisdictions hired health officers.  Localities became more involved in issues of public health and vital statistics, as this broadside illustrates.</dc:description>
