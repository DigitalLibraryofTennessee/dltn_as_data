<dc:description>The minstrel show, or minstrelsy, was an American entertainment consisting of comic skits, variety acts, dancing, and music, performed by white people in blackface or even, especially after the Civil War, blacks in blackface. Minstrel shows lampooned African Americans as ignorant, lazy, buffoonish, superstitious, joyous, and musical. The heyday of the minstrel show was the period between 1840 and 1880.</dc:description>
