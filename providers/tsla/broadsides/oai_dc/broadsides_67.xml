<dc:description>Displays routes and distances of major cities from the departure point of the stage from Abingdon, Virginia.  Smaller towns and communities near those cities are also listed with the additional mileage that would be required to reach them. These distances would then be used to calculate the cost of  transportation.  Advertisement for John M'Cormick's house of ENTERTAINMENT appears at the bottom of the bill.  Handwritten figures on the broadside probably represent a calculation of price.</dc:description>

<dc:description>With the Great Road (Wilderness Road) running through Abingdon and continuing on to Kingsport, Tennessee, Abingdon was a well-developed center of population for Southwest Virginia at the time of this bill.  Stagecoach lines had been running out of Abingdon since the late 1700s.  The first stages coming into Tennessee entered the eastern part of the state as extensions of Virginia routes like this one. Many stops were private residences, defense stations, or the homes of militia officers.</dc:description>
