<dc:description>The Lousiville-Nashville Railroad, or L. &amp; N. Railroad was a rail service that began operation in 1850, though the tracks were not laid from Louisville to Nashville until 1859. The rail line saw service in the Civil War and existed in various configurations before being consolidated into Seaboard System Railroads in 1982.  Today, it is CSX.  The R. J. Meigs referred to in this broadside is, in all probability, Return Jonathan Meigs, a member of the Committee which drafted the first Code of Tennessee (also known as the Meigs-Cooper Code).</dc:description>
