<dc:description>Elizabeth Hutchison Jackson (ca. 1740 - November 2, 1781) was the mother of U. S. President Andrew Jackson. She was born in Carrickfergus, County Antrim, Ireland. She married Andrew Jackson, Sr. in Carrickfergus about 1765. After seeing her son, Andrew, through a near-fatal case of smallpox, she went to Charleston to nurse captured American soldiers languishing on British prisoner-of-war ships. She contracted cholera in Charleston and died when the future president was 14 years old.</dc:description>
