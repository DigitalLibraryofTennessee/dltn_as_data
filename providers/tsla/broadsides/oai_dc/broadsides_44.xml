<dc:description>The Nashville Female Academy opened in 1816 and prospered through the eve of the Civil War, boasting enrollment of upwards of 500 students during its peak.  In 1862, part of the structure was used as a hospital and occupied by Union troops until the end of the war.  It reopened as Lanier Female Academy and finally closed in 1878.</dc:description>
