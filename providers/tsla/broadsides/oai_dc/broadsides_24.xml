<dc:description>Faced with the difficulties inherent in the unprecedented admission of a territory under the Northwest Ordinance of 1789 as well as the election-year struggle between the Federalists and the Jeffersonian Republicans, Tennessee sent a printed copy of its constitution and a report on census returns to Congress for approval on April 8, 1796.  Tennessee became the sixteenth state admitted to the Union on June 1, 1796.</dc:description>
