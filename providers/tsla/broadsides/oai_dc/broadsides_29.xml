<dc:description>At the end of James K. Polk's administration, Polk, then in declining health, announced that he would not seek reelection.  The Whigs, who had been fiercely critical of Polk's war policies, reversed course and named Mexican war hero Zachary Taylor as their presidential candidate, to run against former Democratic Senator Lewis Cass of Michigan.  The Whigs were sharply denounced by their opponents as hypocrites.</dc:description>
