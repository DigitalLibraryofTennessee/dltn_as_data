  <abstract>In 1838, Strickland began a tour of Europe. Throughout his travels, he made some sketches, but the majority of his drawings were done in Rome, where everything interested him and aroused his curiosity. He drew Roman antiquities, medieval towers, and Renaissance St. Peter's. His impressions of this visit to Rome appeared in a series of eleven articles which were published in the Nashville Daily Orthopolitan in 1846. He was critical of popes as architects and of archaeological legends. Strickland left Rome in mid-April 1838, traveling north through Italy and Germany. The Tomb of Cestius is an Egyptian-style pyramid in Rome, near the Porta San Paolo and the Protestant Cemetery. The pyramid is a funerary monument built about 12 B.C. as a tomb for Caius Cestius, Roman praetor, tribune of the people and member of one of the four religious corporations (the Septemviri Epulonum). It is of brick-faced concrete, covered with slabs of white marble. In the 3rd Century, the pyramid was included in the Aurelian Walls, close to the Porta San Paolo, one of the Southern gates. Porta San Paolo is flanked by two cylindrical towers and has two entrances. Near Porta San Paolo, alongside the Pyramid is the Protestant Cemetery, a burial place for non-Catholics. The most famous graves are those of the English poets, John Keats (1795-1821) and Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792-1822).</abstract>
