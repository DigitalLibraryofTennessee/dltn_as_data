  <abstract>William Strickland's watercolor sketch of the Basilica of St. Peter, Rome. Strickland gives handwritten descriptions and dimensions of the building porticoes. He describes the dome as being "decidedly ugly."</abstract>
  <abstract>In 1838, Strickland began a tour of Europe. Throughout his travels, he made some sketches, but the majority of his drawings were done in Rome, where everything interested him and aroused his curiosity. He drew Roman antiquities, medieval towers, and Renaissance St. Peter's. His impressions of this visit to Rome appeared in a series of eleven articles which were published in the Nashville Daily Orthopolitan in 1846. He was critical of popes as architects and of archaeological legends. Strickland left Rome in mid-April 1838, traveling north through Italy and Germany. The Basilica of St. Peter ranks second among the four major basilicas of Rome. It is the most prominent building inside the Vatican City. Possibly the largest church in Christianity, it covers an area of 5.7 acres and has a capacity of over 60,000 people. One of the holiest sites in Christendom, it is, traditionally, the burial site of St. Peter, first Bishop of Rome. Construction of the basilica began on April 18, 1506, and was completed in 1626.</abstract>
