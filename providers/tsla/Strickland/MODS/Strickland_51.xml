  <abstract>William Strickland's watercolor sketch of Pope Gregory XVI and representative sketches of members of the Capuchin Order. Also in the sketch is a cardinal receiving a papal blessing. Strickland provides a description of "Good Friday Services" and a Bible verse.</abstract>
  <abstract>The sketchbook details sketches made by William Strickland during a visit to Europe in 1838. Although he traveled in England, France and Italy, he was especially interested in Roman architecture and culture. He seemed to express some anti-Roman Catholic biases in this sketch. He also believed that papal influences had a negative effect on architecture. Pope Gregory XVI (1765-1846), born Bartolomeo Alberto Cappellari, was Pope of the Roman Catholic Church from 1831 to 1846. Strongly conservative and traditionalist, he opposed democratic and modernizing reforms in the Papal States and throughout Europe, seeking to strengthen the religious and political authority of the papacy. A cardinal is a senior ecclesiastical official, usually a bishop of the Roman Catholic Church and member of the College of Cardinals, which as a body elects a new pope. The Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, "Capuccini Sacerdate", is an order of friars in the Roman Catholic Church, among the chief offshoots of the Franciscans. The order arose in 1520 when Matteo de Bascio, a Franciscan friar, became possessed of the idea that the manner of life led by the Franciscans was not the one which St. Francis had envisioned. He sought to return to the primitive way of life, stressing solitude and penance.</abstract>
