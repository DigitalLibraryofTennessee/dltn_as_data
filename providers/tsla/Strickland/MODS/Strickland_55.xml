  <abstract>William Strickland's watercolor sketch of a Roman tower of the 12th Century. The sketch includes a detail of the corner of the tower. Strickland provides a description of a typical Roman tower.</abstract>
  <abstract>William Strickland began his tour of Europe in 1838. During his travels, he visited England, Italy and France. It was in Rome that he drew the majority of his sketches. Although critical of Medieval architecture, he found the Roman towers to be "very ornamental and decided embellishment to the architecture of the city." Strickland wrote that "the towers are 6 to 8 stories in height, built of bricks, the cornices and other projecting parts are also of brick".</abstract>
