  <abstract>William Strickland's sketch of a steam locomotive belonging to the Great Western Railway. Included are Strickland's written dimensions and details concerning the steam engine.</abstract>
  <abstract>After William Strickland and his family arrived in Liverpool, England, in 1838, he traveled to London and visited various engineering friends. He became interested in recent railroad and locomotive construction, including the Great Western Railway. The Great Western Railway was a Bristol Railway Company and a marvel of civil engineering, linking southwest England, the West Country, and South Wales with London. The Great Western Railway originated from the desire of Bristol merchants to maintain the position of their port as the second port in the country. The company was founded in 1833. Isambard K. Brunel was appointed as engineer of the project. He surveyed the length of the route between London and Bristol himself. One of his chief ambitions was to build a railway on which trains could attain high speeds. The first stretch of the line from Paddington (London) to Taplow, near Maidenhead, opened in 1838. The railway kept its identity unitl it became part of British Railways at Nationalization in 1948.</abstract>
