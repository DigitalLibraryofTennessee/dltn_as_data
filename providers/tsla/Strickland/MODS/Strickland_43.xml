  <abstract>William Strickland's watercolor drawing of the fortress of Radicofani, and the surrounding Tuscan countryside. A small house and a village are shown in the sketch. Strickland provides a handwritten description of the scene.</abstract>
  <abstract>Strickland left Rome in mid-April 1838, and travelled north. Radicofani, located between Rome and Florence, may have been one of his stopping places. The fortress of Radicofani was established ca. 973, and sits on the top of an imposing basaltic cliff from which it dominates the whole territory between Monte Cetona, the Orcia Valley and Monte Aniata. Initially, Radicofani was under the control of the Benedictine Abbey of Monte Aniata. Throughout the years the fortress was disputed between the Abbey and the Counts of Aldobrandeschi; it passed under the control of the Counts of Chiusi, part of which they donated in the 12th Century to the Bishop of Siena. The fortress was the center of a war between Ottone IV and the Pope (1210-1214), and then between Firenze and Siena (1229-1235). In 1263, having given shelter to the Siena Guelfi, it was, for the most part, destroyed by the Ghibelline forces. It was during this period that the legendary figure of Ghino di Tacco, a Ghibelline "Robin Hood," made the fortress a base for his adventures. His exploits were recorded by Dante and Boccaccio. In 1559, the fortress became part of the holdings of the Medici family.</abstract>
