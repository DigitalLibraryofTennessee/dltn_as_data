  <abstract>William Strickland's watercolor sketch of the "New Falls at Tivoli." The three segemented falls are pictured in the foreground, surrounded by wooded hillsides near Tivoli. Strickland gives a brief history of the falls.</abstract>
  <abstract>After Strickland left Rome in mid-April, 1838, he traveled north through Northern Italy and into parts of Germany and France. The Tivoli Falls are segmented falls that run beneath the town of Tivoli, then plunge down a wooded hillside below. The largest segment, the two-tiered Grand Cascata and the segmented Cascatelle are the two main portions of the Aniene Falls. The tunnels, completed by Pope Gregory XVI in 1835, were the attempts to divert high waters and save Tivoli from seasonal flooding, such as the devastating flood in 1826.</abstract>
