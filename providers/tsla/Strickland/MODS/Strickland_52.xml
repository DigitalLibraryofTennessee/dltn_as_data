  <abstract>William Strickland's watercolor sketch of the ceiling of Crosby Hall, London, England, showing the timbers of the roof constructed of oak in a low pointed arch.</abstract>
  <abstract>William Strickland began his tour of Europe in 1838. During his travels, he visited England, Italy and France. After he arived in Liverpool, he traveled to London, where he visited friends and sketched recent railway and locomotive construction, as well as the famous Crosby Hall. Crosby Hall stood in a court on the east side of Bishopsgate Street, a short distance from the parish church of St. Helen's. The hall that remained in the late 18th Century was a part of a large mansion that had been built by Sir John Crosby, a grocer and wool merchant, in the reign of Edward IV. Richard III, as Duke of Gloucester, made the mansion his London home for some time, and William Shakespeare mentions the hall in his play, "Richard III." After the Great Fire of London in 1666, much of the mansion was demolished. Only the Great Hall, and several adjoining chambers remained. Over the years, Crosby Hall was used as offices for the East India Company, as a commercial premises and a meeting hall for Protestant dissenters. The Hall was eventually demolished in the early 20th Century.</abstract>
