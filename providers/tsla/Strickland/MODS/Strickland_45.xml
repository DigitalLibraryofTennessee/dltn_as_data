  <abstract>William Strickland's sketch of the details of an unnamed suspension bridge. The sketch shows details of the iron suspension cords and a cross-section of the bridge trestles.</abstract>
  <abstract>After Strickland left Rome in mid-April, 1838, he traveled north into Germany and France. This sketch represents an unnamed suspension bridge on the Saone River in France. A suspension bridge is one where cables or ropes are strung across a river and the deck is suspended from the cables. Suspension bridges have towers through which the cables are strung. Thus, the towers are supporting the majority of the roadway's weight. The design of the suspension bridge was developed in the early 19th Century. The suspensions in these early bridges were made from chain or linked bars. The bridges on the Saone River were built by order of the French government and the local departments were taxed to defray the costs of construction. The majority of the bridges on this river were constructed between 1830 and 1838.</abstract>
