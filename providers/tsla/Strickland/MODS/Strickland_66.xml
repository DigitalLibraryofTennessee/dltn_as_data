  <abstract>A panoramic watercolor sketch of the Roman ruins from the Colosseum to the foot of Capitoline Hill. Strickland gives details concerning the ruins, along with measurements and details concerning each.</abstract>
  <abstract>In 1838, Strickland began a tour of Europe. Throughout his travels, he made some sketches, but the majority of his drawings were done in Rome, where everything interested him and aroused his curiosity. He drew Roman antiquities, medieval towers and Renaissance St. Peter's. His impressions of this visit to Rome appeared in a series of eleven articles which were published in the Nashville Daily Orthopolitan in 1846. He was critical of popes as architects and of archaeological legends.</abstract>
