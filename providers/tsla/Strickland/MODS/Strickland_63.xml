  <abstract>William Strickland's watercolor drawing of the Pantheon of Agrippa. The view shows the front entrance of the building (porch).</abstract>
  <abstract>The Pantheon was begun in 27 B.C. by the statesman, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. It was completely rebuilt by the Emperor Hadrian sometime between 118 A.D. and 128 A.D., with alterations made in the early 3rd Century by the emperors, Lucius Septimius Serverus and Caracalla. It is a circular building of concrete faced with brick, with a great concrete dome rising from the walls and witha front porch of Corinthian columns supporting a gabled roof with a triangular pediment. Beneath the porch are huge bronze doors 24 feet high, the earliest known examples of this type. The Pantheon was dedicated in 609 A.D. as the Church of Santa Maria Rotunda or Ad Martres, which it remains today. In 1838, Strickland began a tour of Europe. Throughout his travels he made some sketches, but the majority of his drawings were done in Rome, where everything interested him and aroused his curiosity. He drew Roman antiquities, medieval towers, and Renaissance St. Peter's. His impressions of this visit to Rome appeared in a series of eleven articles published in the Nashville Daily Orthopolitan in 1846. He was critical of popes as architects and of archaeological legends. Strickland left Rome in mid-April 1838, traveling north through Italy and Germany.</abstract>
