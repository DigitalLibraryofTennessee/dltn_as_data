<dc:description>In 1838, Strickland began a tour of Europe.  Throughout his travels he made sketches, but the majority of his drawings were done in Rome, where everything interested him and aroused his curiosity.  He drew Roman antiquities, medieval towers, and Renaissance St. Peter's.  His impressions of this visit to Rome appeared in a series of eleven articles published in the Nashville Daily Orthopolitan in 1846.  He was critical of popes as architects and of archaeological legends.  Strickland left Rome in mid-April 1838, traveling north through Italy and Germany. The Temple of Jupiter Stator (Latin meaning "the stayer") was first vowed, traditionally, by Romulus at the critical moment in the battle between the Romans and the Sabines, when Romans had been driven across the Forum valley. This temple was never built, but in 294 B.C., the Consul, Marcus Atilus Regalus, made a similiar vow under similar circumstances in a battle with the Samnites, and erected the temple immediately afterwards. On November 8, 63 A.D., Consul Marcus Tullius Cicero convened the Senate to a meeting in the temple, where he held his first oration against Catiline. The location of the temple is not known with absolute certainty. The written sources give some hint, such as near or just outside of the Porta Magonia, on the higher end of the Via Sacra, or just on the Palatine. When a Medieval tower was demolished in 1827, the ruins of an ancient building appeared, and these remains are frequently identified as the foundations of the Temple of Jupiter Stator.</dc:description>
