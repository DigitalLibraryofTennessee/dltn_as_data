<dc:description>After William Strickland and his family arrived in Liverpool, England, in 1838, he traveled to London where he visited various engineering friends and became interested in recent railroad and locomotive construction, including the Great Western Railway. The Great Western Railway was a Bristol Railway Company and a marvel of civil engineering, linking southwest England, the West Country, and South Wales with London.  The Great Western Railway originated from the desire of Bristol merchants to maintain the position of their port as the second port in the country. The company was founded in 1833. Isambard K. Brunel was appointed as engineer of the project. He surveyed the length of the route between London and Bristol himself. One of his chief ambitions was to build a railway on which trains could attain high speeds. He used a gauge of 7 1/4 feet known as the "Broad Gauge." He also urged the use of timber instead of stone blocks to support the rails. The first stretch of line from Paddington (London) to Taplow near Maidenhead opened in 1838. The railway kept its identity until it became part of British Railways at nationalization in 1848.</dc:description>
