<dc:description>William Strickland began his tour of Europe in 1838.  During his travels, he visited England, Italy and France.  After he arrived in Liverpool, he traveled to London, where he visited friends and sketched recent railroad and locomotive construction as well as Crosby Hall.  Crosby Hall stood in a court on the east side of Bishopsgate Street, a short distance from the parish church of St. Helen's.  The hall that remained in the late 18th Century was part of a large mansion that had been built by Sir John Crosby, a grocer and wool merchant in the reign of Edward IV. Richard III, as Duke of Gloucester, made the mansion his London home for some time, and William Shakespeare mentions the hall in "Richard III." After the Great Fire of London in 1666, much of the mansion was demolished. Only the Great Hall and several adjoining chambers remained. Over the years Crosby Hall was used as offices for the East India Company, as a commercial premises and a meeting hall for Protestant dissenters. The hall was demolished in the early 20th Century.</dc:description>
