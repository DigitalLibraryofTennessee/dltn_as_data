<dc:title>Great Western Railway, Embankment Transverse View</dc:title>
<dc:description>A pen and ink sketch of a transverse view of an embankment on the Great Western Railway.  The sketch shows Strickland's descriptions of the details used in the erection of railroad embankments.</dc:description>
<dc:description>After Strickland and his family arrived in Liverpool in 1838, he traveled to London and visited various engineering friends. He became interested in recent railway and locomotive construction, including the Great Western Railway.  The Great Western Railway was a Bristol (England) Railway Company and a marvel of civil engineering linking Southwest England, the West Country, and South Wales with London.  The Great Western Railway originated from the desire of Bristol merchants to maintain the position of their port as the second port in the country. The company was founded in 1833. Isambard K. Brunel was appointed as engineer of the project. He surveyed the entire length of the route between London and Bristol himself. One of his chief ambitions was to build a railway on which trains could attain high speeds. He used a gauge of 7 1/4 feet, known as the "Broad Guage." He also urged the use of timber instead of stone blocks to support the rails. The first stretch of line from Paddinton London to Taplow near Maidenhead opened in 1838. The railway kept its identity until it became part of British Railways at nationalization in 1948.</dc:description>
