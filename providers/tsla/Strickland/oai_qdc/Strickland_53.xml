<dc:description>William Strickland began his tour of Europe in 1838.  During his travels, he visited England, Italy and France.  Strickland was especially interested in Roman architecture and antiquities and highly critical of papal-sponsored architecture.  He visited Rome until mid-April 1838.  Attila (ca. 406-453) was the monarch of the Huns from 434 until his death.  His empire stretched from the Netherlands to the Ural River and from the Danube River to the Baltic Sea.  During his rule he was one of the most fearsome of the Western and Eastern Roman Empire's enemies. He invaded the Balkans twice, besieging Constantinople on the second invasion. He marched through Gaul (modern France) as far as Orleans before being defeated at the Battle of Chalons, and he drove the Western emperor Valentinian III from his capital at Ravenna in 452. Attila is known in Western history and tradition as the grim "scourge of God," and his name has become a byword for cruelty and barbarism.</dc:description>
