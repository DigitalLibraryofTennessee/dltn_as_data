<dc:title>Detail of the Palace of Constantine (Palace of Lateran)</dc:title>
<dc:description>William Strickland's watercolor sketch of the columns in the cloister of Basilica de S. Giovanni in Laterano.  The sketch shows an unfinished drawing and next to it a finished sketch.  Strickland gives a handwritten description of the columns.</dc:description>
<dc:description>William Strickland began his tour of Europe in 1838.  In Rome, Strickland was fascinated with Roman archtecture and antiquities.  It was in Rome that he drew the majority of his sketches.  He remained in Rome until mid-April 1838.  The Palace of the Lateran (Palace of Constantine) is an ancient palace of the Roman Empire and later a palace of the Popes.  It is the oldest and ranks first among the four great basilicas of Rome.  The site was, in ancient times, occupied by the palace of the family of the Laterani. The palace eventually came into the hands of Constantine, the first Christian emperor, through his wife, Fausta. Constantine gave it to the church in the time of Miltiades, no later than ca. 311. From that time it has always been the center of Christian life within Rome, the residence of the popes and the Cathedral of Rome. Off the left transept of the basilica is the 13th Century cloister, the work of Jacapo and Pietro Vassalletto (ca. 1220-1236), and an example of Cosmatesque art. The columns, as pictured, some plain and some twisted, are adorned with mosaics and have varied capitals.</dc:description>
