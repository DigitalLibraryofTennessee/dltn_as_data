<dc:title>Aqueductius Aelii Adriani Pont de Gard</dc:title>
<dc:description>William Strickland's watercolor sketch of the Pont du Gard aqueduct near Nimes, France.  The sketch includes his written description of the aqueduct.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The sketchbook is of detailed drawings made by William Strickland during a visit to Europe in 1838.  Although he traveled in England, France and Italy, he was especially interested in Roman antiquities.  One of his most ambitious drawings is of the Pont du Gard, an aqueduct in the south of France, located near Remoulins.  Built on three levels, it is 49 meters high, and the longest level is 275 meters long.  Construction began in the middle of the 1st Century A. D.  Its construction is atrributed to Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. Designed to carry water across the small Gardon River valley, it was part of a nearly 31-mile aqueduct that brought water to the Roman city of Nimes. It was constructed entirely without the use of mortar. The stones, some of which weigh up to 6 tons, are held together with iron clamps. The masonry was lifted into place by block and tackle, with a human-powered treadmill providing the power for the winch. It is believed to have taken about 3 years to build, employing between 800 and 1,000 workers. From the Middle Ages to the 18th Century, the aqueduct was used as a conventional bridge to facilitate foot traffic across the river. The aqueduct was restored in the 18th Century and by Strickland's time, it had become a major tourist site.</dc:description>
