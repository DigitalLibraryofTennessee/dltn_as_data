<dc:title>Tomb of Nero on the Via Flamina</dc:title>
<dc:description>William Strickland's watercolor sketch of the tomb of Nero.  Also shown is part of a fence and a section of the Via Flaminia.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The sketchbook details sketches made by William Strickland during a visit to Europe in 1838.  Although he traveled in England, France and Italy, he was especially interested in Roman antiquities.  The tomb of Nero was located 6 miles from Rome on the Via Flaminia.  Nero was born in 37 A.D., and was the fifth and last emperor of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.  He ruled from 54 to 68 A.D.  During his rule, Nero focused much of his attention on diplomacy, trade and increasing the cultural capital of the empire. He ordered the building of theaters and promoted athletic games. His reign included a successful war and negotiated peace with the Parthian Empire (58-63 A.D.). Popular legend remembers Nero as a libertine and a tyrant. Galba's Hispanic revolt of 68 A.D. led to his reported suicide, and the civil war that ensued from his death. The Via Flaminia was a Roman road leading from Rome to Ariminum (Rimini), and was the most important route to the north. It was constructed by Gaius Flaminius during his censorship (220 B.C.). It became the main axis of transportation by which wheat from the Po Valley supplied Rome and central Italy.</dc:description>
