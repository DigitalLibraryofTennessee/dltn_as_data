<dc:title>Ponti di Rotto and the Forum Boarium</dc:title>
<dc:description>William Strickland's watercolor sketch of the Forum Boarium, Rome, Italy.  Included are sketches of bridges, the Tiber River, and Roman antiquities.</dc:description>
<dc:description>William Strickland began his tour of Europe in 1838.  In Rome, Strickland was fascinated with architecture and antiquities.  It was in Rome that he drew the majority of his sketches.  He remained in Rome until mid-April 1838.  The Forum Boarium was located on a flat area near the Tiber River between the Capitoline, the Palatine and Aventine hills. It was the cattle forum of Ancient Rome, and the oldest forum in Rome.  The Forum Boarium was the site of the first gladiatorial contest in 264 B.C. Ponte de Rotto, the first all-stone bridge over the Tiber is the remains of an original arch belonging to the Ponte S. Maria, which after two previous collapses was reconstructed under Pope Gregory XIII (before 1575) on the rests of the ancient bridge, Pons Aemilius, built in 179 B.C. It was here the first bridges were built.   A flood in 1598 took away an arch of the bridge. The only piece left during Strickland's visit was "Ponte di Rotto" (meaning "broken bridge"). Ponte Cestia was built in 46 B.C. by the consul Cestius. In 365 A.D., it was almost entirely rebuilt by the Emperor Valens and his sons. The bridge was restored in 1192. The Temple of Portunus, incorrectly known as the "Temple of Fortuna Virilis" (Latin "manly fortune") was dedicated to Protunus, the god of keys, doors, livestock, and warehouses. The temple was built ca. 100 B.C. and restored in the 1st Century. It was converted to a church in 872 and rededicated as the "Santa Maria Egyziaca" (St. Mary of Egypt). The Temple of Hercules Victor (Temple of Vesta) is a round temple of Greek design surrounded by columns. It was once mistaken for a temple of Vesta, but it has been determined to be a temple of Hercules. Hercules was a favorite divinity for traders, so it is appropriate that it would be in this forum. The building was constructed ca. 120 B.C. and is the earliest surviving marble building in Rome. By 1132, the temple had been converted to a church, known as "St. Stephen of Carriages."</dc:description>
