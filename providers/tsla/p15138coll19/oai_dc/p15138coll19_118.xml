<dc:title>"A View of Col. Johnson's Engagement with the Savages (commanded by Tecumseh) near the Moravian Town, October 5th, 1812 [sic]"</dc:title>
<dc:description>Hand-colored woodcut depicts Colonel Richard Mentor Johnson defending himself against an Indian chief, American infantrymen firing on the enemy, a dismounted soldier engaging an Indian in hand-to-hand combat, a savage in the act of scalping a wounded drummer, cavalry pursuing retreating savages, and Tecumseh rallying his men. Prominent features are numbered. N.B. The word "savage" is used several times in the original illustration caption. N. Dearborn, engraver.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Battle of Moraviantown was actually fought in 1813, not 1812. It is also known as the Battle of the Thames. A decisive U. S. victory there finalized American control of the Northwest. General William Henry Harrison commanded U.S. infantry and cavalry troops against a combined force of Indian Confederation warriors and the British. Several brigades of Kentucky militia supplemented Harrison's command. Colonel Johnson, a Kentucky War Hawk, may have been the one who shot and killed Tecumseh, the Shawnee chief who commanded the Confederation.</dc:description>
