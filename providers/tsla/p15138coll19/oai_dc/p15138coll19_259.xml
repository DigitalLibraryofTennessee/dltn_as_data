<dc:title>Tennessee River bridge at Knoxville</dc:title>
<dc:description>View of the arched Henley Street Bridge that spans the Tennessee River at Knoxville. The river is low, exposing mud and shoals. Atop the hill in the background is the University of Tennessee campus (Science Hall and Ayres Hall). A train on the tracks of the railroad bridge can be seen behind Henley Street.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Before completion of the Fort Loudon Dam, the Tennessee River at Knoxville looked like this. The Tennessee Valley Authority was created in 1933 as a New Deal corporation to manage natural resources and provide low-cost electric power to the people of the Tennessee River Valley. The nine TVA dams control floods, improve navigation, and provide cheap hydroelectricity for residents of seven states.</dc:description>
