<dc:description>At right, the fictional "Garth Island," reached by a current-pushed ferry. This location, at Coon Denton, a few miles up the Hiwassee River from Calhoun, Tennessee, was chosen to represent typical bottomland before the TVA dam was closed. The movie "Wild River" (1960) brought attention to the thousands of Tennesseans who had been forced to abandon their homes and land to make way for the Tennessee Valley Authority. Directed by Elia Kazan, the movie starred Montgomery Clift and Lee Remick.</dc:description>
