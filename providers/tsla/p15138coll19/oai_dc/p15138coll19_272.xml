<dc:description>Red and khaki front book cover for Gleason L. Archer's "On the Cuff" is decorated with a circular logo in the style of a wax seal. Printed inside the seal is an extended left arm, or "Uncle Sam's 'Left Wing,'" as the coat sleeve is labeled. On the cuff is written "338 Billions/Baby Will Pay."

<dc:description>The New Deal had many detractors who felt that President Roosevelt's policies were socialistic. Importantly, they feared the creation of a welfare state and the destruction of free enterprise and Jeffersonian democracy. In his first 100 days, FDR sent a record number of bills to Congress designed to alleviate the effects of the Depression. Some Americans, like Archer, believed he went too far, and they questioned the constitutionality of several programs. "On the Cuff" is a conservative indictment of FDR's policies.</dc:description>
