<dc:title>Letter from John Coffee written to Samuel Houston</dc:title>
<dc:description>A four-page letter written from Florence, Alabama, on April 25, 1828. Coffee answers Sam Houston's inquiry regarding the accusation by some that the Battle of Horseshoe Bend was a "cold blooded massacre." Coffee defends General Andrew Jackson's conduct there and throughout the war. Coffee mentions "Lincoyer," the infant Creek whom Jackson later adopted, and he states that the child's mother had been unavoidably killed at Tallushatchee.</dc:description>
