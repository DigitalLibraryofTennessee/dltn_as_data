<dc:description>James Monroe's presidency ushered in the "Era of Good Feelings" following the War of 1812. He was elected fifth president in 1816 and was reelected in 1820. Early in his first administration, the nationalism that characterized the Era of Good Feelings began to crack, and serious sectional issues grew. The Monroe Doctrine, which announced a hands-off policy to European powers seeking additional colonies in the Western Hemisphere, was effective well into the 20th century.</dc:description>
