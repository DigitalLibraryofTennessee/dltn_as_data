<dc:title>Battle of New Orleans scene</dc:title>
<dc:description>Color engraving, "Battle of New Orleans," depicts British redcoats attacking an American position. The Americans are firing muskets and a cannon at the enemy. From John Frost, "An Illuminated History of North America."</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Battle of New Orleans was fought between American and British forces on January 8, 1815. Because of slow transatlantic communications, neither General Andrew Jackson nor British commander Sir Edward Pakenham was aware that a peace treaty had been signed two weeks earlier. The Treaty of Ghent (December 24, 1814) ended the War of 1812, so Jackson's overwhelming victory at New Orleans had no effect on the war's outcome.</dc:description>
