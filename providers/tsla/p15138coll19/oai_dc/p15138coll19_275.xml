<dc:title>Political cartoon, "Certainly, We'll Shoulder Our Part"</dc:title>
<dc:description>Joe Parrish political cartoon shows tall Uncle Sam carrying an oversize bundle labeled, "Uncle Sam's Relief Burden." Standing next to him is a tiny image of President Franklin D. Roosevelt holding a much smaller bag labeled, "Our Local Community Chest Duty." The cartoon is one of many in a scrapbook kept by young Henry McRaven. Parrish signed the opening page.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Joe Parrish, a native Tennessean, was a political cartoonist at the Nashville Banner, Nashville Tennessean, and Chicago Tribune. During the 1930s, Parrish both praised and parodied New Deal programs. At the Tribune, Parrish was one of three native Tennessee cartoonists, the others being Carey Orr and Daniel E. Holland. Because of their acerbic caricatures, the publisher referred to them as "the terrible three from Tennessee."</dc:description>
