<dc:description>Controversial figure General James Wilkinson served in the Revolution and War of 1812. In 1787, he turned traitor and became a secret agent for Spain. After Thomas Jefferson purchased the Louisiana Territory from France, he appointed Wilkinson governor.  Wilkinson was later accused of treason for his participation in Aaron Burr's conspiracy to separate Louisiana from the U.S. Their goal was to create an independent nation friendly to Spain. Wilkinson betrayed Burr and aided in his capture.</dc:description>
