<dc:description>By the 1930s, nearly 90% of the U. S. population living in urban areas had electricity while only 10% of the rural population did.  To address this problem, the Roosevelt Administration created the Rural Electrification Administration [REA] in 1935. By 1939, the efforts of the REA, Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), etc. had increased the number of rural households with electricity to 25%.</dc:description>
