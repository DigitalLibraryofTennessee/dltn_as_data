<dc:description>Clipping. Front-page editorial letter to U.S. Representative Clarence W. Turner protesting the placement of a Negro Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp at Montgomery Bell Park. The writer says the Army's intention to place black enlistees at the park "will cause no end of trouble and probably bloodshed."</dc:description>
<dc:description>At the time of his death in 1939, Clarence Wyly Turner was a Democratic representative from Tennessee's Sixth Congressional District. J. E. Reeder was editor of the "The New Idea." African American CCC camps often were not welcome in white-populated areas of the South. Around 200,000 black men served in the CCC. The New Idea was published in Burns, Dickson County, Tennessee.</dc:description>
