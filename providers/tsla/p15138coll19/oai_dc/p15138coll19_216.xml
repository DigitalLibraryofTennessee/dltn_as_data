<dc:title>Coffin handbills pamphlet</dc:title>
<dc:description>Eight woodcut &#8220;coffin handbills&#8221; compiled in a pamphlet known as &#8220;Monumental Inscriptions.&#8221; Each illustration is in a tombstone shape with epitaphs.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The &#8220;coffin handbills&#8221; were distributed by the anti-Jacksonians during the presidential campaign of 1828. Their purpose was to smear Jackson&#8217;s character. The handbills brought attention to the militiamen Jackson ordered executed during the Creek War and War of 1812: John Harris, David Hunt, Edward Linsey, Jacob Webb, Henry Lewis, David Morrow, and John Woods. Pamphlet includes memorials to six militiamen and one to the memory of John Woods's mother.</dc:description>
