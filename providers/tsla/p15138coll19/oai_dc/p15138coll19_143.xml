<dc:description>Portrait of Creek chief William McIntosh wearing a cape over a checkered red vest and white shirt. His hand is on the hilt of a sword and his headdress is adorned with a single feather. </dc:description>
<dc:description>William McIntosh (or MacIntosh) was born in Georgia about 1785 of mixed ancestry, his father being a Scots trader and his mother a Creek Indian. He became a Creek chief at an early age and fought on the side of the Americans during the Creek War (1813-1814).  His contiuned alliance with the U. S. government led to his death in 1825 by rival Creeks incensed at McIntosh's participation at the Indian Springs treaty which surrendred millions of acres to the Federal government.</dc:description>
