<dc:title>Civilian Conservation Corps Fire and Chow Gang</dc:title>
<dc:description>Five CCC members in a mix of dress and work uniforms pose on and in front of the circular gong used to notify the camp of fire and meal time.  One of the men is holding the hammer used to strike the gong and sound the alarm.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This group was associated with CCC Company 417, located 12 miles southwest of Tellico Plains.  Their post office was at Ivy, Tennessee, and the camp was classified as camp F-14; this designation indicates that theirs was a national forest camp.; This image was donated by Charles Rutherford.</dc:description>
