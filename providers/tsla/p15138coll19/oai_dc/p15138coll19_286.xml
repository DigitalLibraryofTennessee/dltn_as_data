<dc:title>Telegram to Governor Hill McAlister</dc:title>
<dc:description>Western Union telegram protests the placement of a junior CCC camp at "my little home town," Pikeville, Tennessee. </dc:description>
<dc:description>Samuel Davis McReynolds was a member of the U.S. Congress, 1923-1939. A Democrat, he represented Tennessee's Third Congressional District. The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was established in 1933 as a means of providing jobs for young men from relief families. The enlistees planted trees; built bridges, parks, and roads; cultivated forests and constructed fire towers; and drained swamps. Draining swamps went a long way in preventing malaria. The "Tree Army" employed around 200,000 black men during the Depression.</dc:description>
