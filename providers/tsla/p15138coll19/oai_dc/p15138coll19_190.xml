<dc:description>Drawing of the plantation house that served as General Andrew Jackson's headquarters on the battlefield outside of New Orleans during the final phase of the War of 1812.</dc:description>
<dc:description>After the British forces landed south of New Orleans in late December 1814, General Andrew Jackson staved off the initial assault on the night of December 23. Afterwards, Jackson built a defensive line on the plains of Chalmette, a few miles south of the city of New Orleans. Jackson used the McCarty plantation house, depicted here, for his headquarters.</dc:description>
