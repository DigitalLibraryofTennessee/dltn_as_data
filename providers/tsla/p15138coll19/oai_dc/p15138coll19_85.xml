<dc:title>Captain James Lawrence portrait</dc:title>
<dc:description>Full-length portrait of Captain James Lawrence (1781-1813), in uniform, holding a saber, and seated in ship's interior. The engraving is from the original painting by Alonzo Chappel.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Lawrence was commander of the U.S.S. Hornet during the War of 1812. In 1813, he commanded the U.S.S. Chesapeake which lost its battle with the British ship H.M.S. Shannon. The Navy's motto Don't give up the ship is attributed to Lawrence who - though mortally wounded - gave the order to his officers.</dc:description>
