<dc:title>Political cartoon, "The Destiny of a Nation"</dc:title>
<dc:description>Editorial cartoon shows Uncle Sam standing in a hand representing the Supreme Court. Uncle Sam holds a large scroll labeled "New Deal." The cartoon is pasted in a scrapbook signed by Tennessean cartoonist Joe Parrish, but the cartoon identifies the artist as Cross.</dc:description>
<dc:description>President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal provided plenty of fodder for editorial cartoonists. Early on conservatives were alarmed by what they considered the establishment of a welfare state. Conservative justices struck down a number of FDR's signature "alphabet agencies," including the AAA (Agricultural Adjustment Act) and the NRA (National Recovery Act). </dc:description>
