<dc:description>The Work Projects Administration (WPA, formerly Works Progress Administration) infused funds into many libraries. In rural areas of Kentucky and the Appalachians, librarians often used horses as mobile libraries. Marshall Stewart was the Tennessee state supervisor for the Library Service Program. The photos are from the annual report issued for 1940-1941.</dc:description>
