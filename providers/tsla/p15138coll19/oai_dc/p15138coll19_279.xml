<dc:description>In 1937 the Cumberland, Tennessee, Ohio, and Mississippi Rivers flooded to create the worst disaster in American history to that date. In January 21.24 inches (156 trillion tons) of rain fell in a 12-state region. Governor Gordon Browning activated the Tennessee National Guard because of record flooding in East and Middle Tennessee. Volunteers, state highway patrolmen, WPA workers, volunteers, and the Red Cross helped with sandbagging, providing for refugees, and building temporary housing.</dc:description>
