<dc:description>The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was created in 1933 and was one of the first New Deal projects. It was designed to ease the Depression by creating jobs and to promote environmental conservation. Young men who enlisted in the ""Tree Army""; built roads, fire towers, bridges and canals, and planted trees for reforestation and erosion control. By 1942, the CCC had built 800 parks and planted 3 billion trees. The program was one of the most popular of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal programs.</dc:description>
