<dc:description>The recognizable Blue Eagle was the symbol of the National Recovery Administration (NRA), created in 1933. The NRA was one of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal "alphabet agencies" created to ease the effects of the Depression. It was intended to stimulate business recovery through fair practices. Its goal was to  reduce unemployment, establish minimum wages and maximum hours, and guarantee the right of labor to bargain collectively. Some considered the NRA socialistic, and though it was invalidated by the Supreme Court in 1935, many of its provisions were included in later legislation.</dc:description>
