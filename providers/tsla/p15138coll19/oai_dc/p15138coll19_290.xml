<dc:description>Fort Negley was a Federal fortification in Nashville at the time of the Civil War. According to historian Carroll Van West the polygonal fort was built with timber, stone, and dirt in 1862 largely by African American labor. During the Battle of Nashville (1864) the garrison included troops of the USCT. Following the war the fort was used as a Ku Klux Klan gathering place. The Works Progress Administration (WPA) restored the structure in 1936-1937.</dc:description>
