<dc:title>National Recovery Administration poster</dc:title>
<dc:description>Small red, white, and blue makeshift poster advertising the National Recovery Administration. Surrounding the blue eagle logo are the words, NRA MEMBER/U.S./WE DO OUR PART. The printed poster is glued to the backside of a color mountain scene.</dc:description>
<dc:description>At President Franklin D. Roosevelt's suggestion, Congress created the NRA in 1933. It was intended to boost business recovery by implementing fair trade practices. Roosevelt hoped it would ease unemployment, create minimum wages, and allow for collective bargaining. The NRA was short-lived. The Supreme Court invalidated it in 1935. Businesses were encouraged to display the "Blue Eagle" emblem in their windows.</dc:description>
