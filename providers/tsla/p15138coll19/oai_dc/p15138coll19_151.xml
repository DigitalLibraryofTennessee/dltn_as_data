<dc:description>Though it was fought after the Treaty of Ghent was signed, the Battle of New Orleans (January 8, 1815) was a decisive victory for the United States in its war against Great Britain. Major-General Andrew Jackson commanded American troops, and British forces fought under the command of Major-General Sir Edward Pakenham. The War of 1812, also known as the ""Second American Revolution,"" brought greater American self-confidence and national pride.</dc:description>
