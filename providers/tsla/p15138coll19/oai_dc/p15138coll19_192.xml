<dc:description>Andrew Jackson was entertained at this house in Washington, D.C. on November 15, 1815.  The house was constructed between 1798 and 1800 for Colonel John  Tayloe,  a wealthy Virginia plantation owner. The architect of the U.S. Capitol, Dr. William Thornton , designed this structure as well. After the British burned the White House, Tayloe offered his home to President and Mrs. Madision.  Madision signed the Treaty of Ghent ending the War of 1812 at Octagon House.</dc:description>
