<dc:description>Illustrator Dean Cornwell painted several murals in Tennessee during the Depression. The WPA and other New Deal unemployment relief projects funded many artists to create art for public buildings nationwide. This mural, in the John Sevier State Office Building, Nashville, depicts the development of Tennessee. Its companion, "Discovery," features John Sevier and other earlier Tennessee heroes. WPA artists painted murals in about two dozen Tennessee post offices, including Camden, Clarksville, Crossville, Columbia, Dickson, Lewisburg, Lenoir City, and Sweetwater. </dc:description>
