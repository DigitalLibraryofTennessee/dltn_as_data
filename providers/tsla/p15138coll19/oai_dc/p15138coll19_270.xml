<dc:description>Black and white studio photograph shows an elderly African American man talking to an older gray-haired white woman. The man, in overalls, holds a hound on a leash.

<dc:description>The motion-picture film "Wild River" was released in 1960 by Twentieth Century-Fox. It tells the story of the Garth family and their farm hands who are forced to leave their river island as the Tennessee Valley Authority floods their land. Blue was not for sale, but Sam would give him to Miss Ella if she wanted to stay. The TVA was created in 1933 to manage natural resources in the Tennessee River Valley. It brought low-cost hydroelectricity to the valley people, improved river navigation, and controlled flooding. </dc:description>
