<dc:description>Kentuckians and Tennesseans comprised most of Jackson's militia. The Americans overwhelmed the British at the Battle of New Orleans on January 8, 1815. Because of slow transatlantic communication, neither side knew that the Treaty of Ghent had been signed two weeks earlier. Consequently, the battle had no effect on the war's outcome. Jackson came into national prominence and was elected 7th President in 1828. He was reelected in 1832.</dc:description>
