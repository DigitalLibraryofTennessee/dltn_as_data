<dc:title>Telegram, Walter Chandler to Governor Hill </dc:title>
<dc:description>Western Union telegram protests the placement of a Negro Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp at Collierville, Shelby County. Collierville had been designated for a white camp, and the change is "very embarrassing to me." It is signed Walter Chandler.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Walter Chandler was a member of Congress and served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1935 to 1940. A Democrat, he represented Tennessee's Ninth Congressional District. The CCC was established in 1933 as a means to provide jobs for young men from relief families. Enlistees planted trees; built bridges, parks, and roads; cultivated forests and constructed fire towers; and drained swamps. Draining swamps went a long way toward preventing malaria. Around 200,000 "colored" men served in the CCC.</dc:description>
