<dc:title>Political cartoon, "The Nation's Champion Recovery Producer"</dc:title>
<dc:description>A cow symbolizing the AAA (Agricultural Adjustment Act) stands by milk cans touting the success of the program. The first can is labeled, "Increased Farm Income," and the middle one is labeled, "Business and Industrial Gains through Re-Establishment of Agriculture's Purchasing Power." The cow feeds on the processing tax used to help pay the farmers. An obese industrialist,  pointing out the cow to a man representing the Supreme Court, says, "I want her killed so we won't have to feed her."</dc:description>
<dc:description>In the first 100 days of his presidency, Franklin D. Roosevelt introduced a record number of proposals designed to ease the Depression. Among the first was the AAA. Its intent was to raise depressed farm prices to pre-World War I levels. The money to pay the farmers for cutting back production by about 30 percent was raised by a tax on companies that bought agricultural products and processed them into food and clothing. The Supreme Court nixed the Act, declaring it unconstitutional. The cartoonist, Joe Parrish, was working for the Nashville Tennessean at the time.</dc:description>
