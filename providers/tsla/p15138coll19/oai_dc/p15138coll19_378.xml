<dc:description>The motion picture "Wild River" (1960) brought attention to the thousands of Tennesseans who had been forced to abandon their homes and land to make way for the Tennessee Valley Authority. Directed by Elia Kazan, the movie starred Lee Remick and Montgomery Clift. This movie still shows the Garth Island hands leaving as the lake begins to rise.</dc:description>
