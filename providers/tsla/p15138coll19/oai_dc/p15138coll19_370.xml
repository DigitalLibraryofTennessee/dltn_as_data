<dc:title>Water tank built by CCC at Pickett State Forest</dc:title>
<dc:description>Photograph of two men at a stone-clad water tank built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in Pickett State Forest.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) did the initial development of the Pickett State Forest site following the donation of the 12,000 acres to the state by Stearns Coal and Lumber Company in 1933.  Between 1934 and 1942, hiking trails, cabins, a lodge, a ranger station, and a 12-acre lake were put in place.  CCC employees quarried native sandstone from the area to use in building construction.  The Park appears on the National Register of Historic Places.</dc:description>
