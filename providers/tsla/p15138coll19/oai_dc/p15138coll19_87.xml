<dc:description>Major-General Andrew Jackson commanded American militiamen and U.S. regulars during the Battle of New Orleans (January 8, 1815). Sir Edward Pakenham, who was killed that day, led British forces. Because of slow transatlantic communications, neither commander knew that a peace treaty had ended the War of 1812 two weeks earlier in Ghent (in present-day Belgium).</dc:description>
