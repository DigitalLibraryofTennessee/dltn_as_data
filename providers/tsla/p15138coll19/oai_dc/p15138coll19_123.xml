<dc:title>General Andrew Jackson equestrian portrait</dc:title>
<dc:description>Hand-colored woodcut of General Andrew Jackson wearing blue coat, red sash, and gold epaulets. While Jackson rides his white horse, a fallen British soldier lies dead on the field.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Jackson commanded American forces at the Battle of New Orleans (January 8, 1815) and achieved a resounding victory over the British. Neither British nor American commanders knew that a peace treaty ending the War of 1812 had been signed two weeks earlier. The battle made Jackson a national hero. Jackson was elected 7th President of the United States in 1828 and was reelected in 1832.</dc:description>
