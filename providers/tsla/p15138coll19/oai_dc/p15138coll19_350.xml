<dc:description>The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC, 1933-1942) was one of the alphabet agencies created by the New Deal to ease the effects of the Great Depression. The CCC provided economic relief for unemployed young men by putting them to work on conservation projects. They built roads, bridges, state parks and forests, hiking trails, fire towers, and other public works. More than seventy thousand Tennesseans served in the CCC. In 1937, the number of camps in Tennessee peaked at forty-six. </dc:description>
