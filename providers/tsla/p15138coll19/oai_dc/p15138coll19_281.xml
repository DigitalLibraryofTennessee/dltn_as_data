<dc:title>The Plantation South, 1934-1937</dc:title>
<dc:description>Umber paper cover of "The Plantation South, 1934-1937," an illustrated research monograph of the Work Projects Administration (WPA), shows drawings of an idealized plantation house and what could be a sharecropper's cabin. The booklet is identified as Research Monograph XXII. </dc:description>
<dc:description> The monograph analyzed data and reported on changes in planation organization and operation in the South. It found that of the 246 plantations surveyed, both landlords and tenants improved their financial status, though sharecroppers' net income averaged only about $400 per family. The study found that rural Southern folk suffered widespread unemployment and underemployment. In 1937, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed a commission that concluded the South was economic problem one.</dc:description>
