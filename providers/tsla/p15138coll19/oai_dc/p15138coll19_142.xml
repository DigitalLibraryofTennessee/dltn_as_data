<dc:title>Battle of Tallushatchee scene</dc:title>
<dc:description>The image shows General Andrew Jackson cutting down Indians from atop a white horse. From John Frost and W. Croome, "Pictorial Life of Andrew Jackson." </dc:description>
<dc:description>The battle took place on November 3, 1813, and was America's first victory against the Red Sticks in the Creek War (1813-1814). General John Coffee, a Tennessean, led the American forces who completely destroyed the village and killed many Creeks. A ten-month-old Creek orphan named Lincoya was taken from the battlefield to Fort Strother, where he caught the eye of General Andrew Jackson. The Jackson family later adopted the boy. David Crocket and Sam Houston also fought in the battle.</dc:description>
