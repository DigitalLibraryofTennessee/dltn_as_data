<dc:title>Norris Dam at night</dc:title>
<dc:description>Unidentified couple standing next to Norris Dam's spillway and looking at the dam as it is lit up at night. Caption on reverse reads: "This night scene shows water from TVA's Norris reservoir being released over the spillway after crest of the 1937 flood had subsided. Although Norris Dam is more than 700 river-miles from Cairo, Illinois, it was largely responsible for lowering the crest at that city by nearly half a foot when the flood was above its levees and held back by mud boxes hastily erected."</dc:description>
