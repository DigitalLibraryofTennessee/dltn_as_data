<dc:description>The Works Progress Administration (WPA) was a New Deal program designed to put unemployed Americans back to work. Between 1935 and its termination in 1943, the WPA employed approximately 8 million workers. In Tennessee, the WPA built roads, sewer systems, bridges, waterways, dams, viaducts, and overpasses. It also built airports in Memphis, Chattanooga, Jackson, Clarksville, Knoxville, Nashville, Bristol, and numerous other Tennessee cities.</dc:description>
