<dc:description>The Public Works Administration (PWA) was one of the first of the New Deal "alphabet agencies" intended to alleviate the effects of the Depression. It was created as part of the National Industrial Recovery Act in 1933. In cooperation with state, county, and city governments, the PWA spent $4 billion constructing 70 per cent of the nation's new educational buildings; 65 per cent of its new courthouses, city halls, and sewage plants; 35 per cent of its new public health facilities; and 10 per cent of all new bridges, roads, and subways.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </dc:description>
