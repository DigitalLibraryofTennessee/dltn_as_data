<dc:description>The Garth family burying ground was fabricated by the [movie] magicians.  Later, this hilltop was lopped off, put on a barge, and hauled out into Chickamauga Lake for a final shot. Directed by Elia Kazan, the movie starred Montgomery Clift and Lee Remick. The motion picture "Wild River" (1960) brought attention to the thousands of Tennesseans who had been forced to abandon their homes and land to make way for the Tennessee Valley Authority.</dc:description>
