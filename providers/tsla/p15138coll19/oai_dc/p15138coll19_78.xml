<dc:title>"The Battle of New Orleans" scene</dc:title>
<dc:description>Engraving of Major-General Andrew Jackson, sword aloft, standing with troops behind American ramparts at the Battle of New Orleans. Two frontier militiamen and a black man are in forefront. The black man is rummaging through a bag of musket balls. U.S. regulars fire from behind the cotton-bale barricade while British soldiers attack. Scattered on the ground are a broken drum, a musket, and cannonballs. A tattered American flag waves at top center.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Jackson commanded American troops during the Battle of New Orleans, January 8, 1815. Since transatlantic communication was so slow, the combatants had not yet learned that the Treaty of Ghent ended the War of 1812 two weeks earlier. Jackson became a national hero and was elected seventh U.S. president in 1828. He was reelected in 1832. Engraved by H. B. Hall.</dc:description>
