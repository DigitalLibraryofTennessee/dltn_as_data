<dc:description>Colonel Robert Rennie, leading British infantrymen and fusiliers, died in an assault on Americans at the Battle of New Orleans (January 8, 1815). The Treaty of Ghent, signed two weeks earlier, ended the War of 1812. Because of slow transatlantic communications, neither the British nor Americans knew the war was over.</dc:description>
