<dc:title>Letter from P. Warner Frazer to Captain George A. Frazer</dc:title>
<dc:description>Frazer's four-page letter (with postal cover) to Dear Father describes his work and accommodations in a Louisiana CCC camp. Everything about the camp is very pleasant, and the men share two to a tent. Tents have wooden floors and gas heat. We have seen quite a few chameleons. They are very cute. They look like ordinary little lizards but they change color.... [chameleons] have a way of blowing out their throat when they get excited. It opens up just like a fan.  Includes writer's primitive drawing of a chameleon. Postal cover included as fifth page.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Frazer was assigned to CCC Camp Urania Forest (No. 1492), near Olla, La. The Civilian Conservation Corps (1933-1942) was one of the alphabet agencies created by the New Deal to combat the Great Depression. The CCC provided economic relief for young men by putting them to work on projects to conserve and develop the country's natural resources. </dc:description>
