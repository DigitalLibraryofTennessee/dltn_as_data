<dc:title>The Business and Professional Women's Hour, Talk Number Three, The Underlying Philosophy of the NRA</dc:title>
<dc:description>Talk given by Otho C. Ault, Professor of Rural Economics, George Peabody College for Teachers, in support of the National Recovery Administration.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Business and Professional Women's Hour was a radio show broadcast by WSM. The National Recovery Administration (NRA) was a New Deal program created by the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) in 1933. Its goal was to help businesses and workers by setting minimum wages, maximum weekly work hours, and by fixing prices. The NIRA was declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1935 in A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495. The NRA was dissolved as a result. Peabody College became part of Vanderbilt University in 1979.</dc:description>
