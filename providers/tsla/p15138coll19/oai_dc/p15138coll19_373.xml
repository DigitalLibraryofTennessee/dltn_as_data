<dc:description>The Civilian Conservation Corps was a public relief program created by Congress in 1937.  It provided jobs for unemployed young men and promoted environmental conservation. One of the first New Deal programs, the CCC built roads, homes, and fire towers. Its reforestation projects replaced trees on lands that had been overfarmed or cleared by loggers. The CCC  vastly improved state and national park infrastructure.</dc:description>
