<dc:description>Portrait of Creek warrior Menawa in colorful Native-American clothing and a beaded bag.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Menawa was a half-blooded Creek warrior who supported the British during the War of 1812 and opposed the cession of tribal lands to the white people. He fought in support of the United States during the Seminole War, but was later forced to move west during the removal to Indian territory from 1836-1840. Menawa was also known as "Crazy War Hunter" because of his daring exploits during battle.</dc:description>
