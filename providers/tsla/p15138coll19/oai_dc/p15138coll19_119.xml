<dc:description>From the Franklin D. Roosevelt Naval Collection. (The Old Navy I, 1799-1815). The Battle of Lake Erie took place off the coast of Ohio on September 10, 1813. It was a major victory for the U. S. Navy fleet in the War of 1812, and it gave the Americans full control of the lake. Two well-known phrases originated during the battle. "We have met the enemy and they are ours," and "Don't give up the ship!"</dc:description>
