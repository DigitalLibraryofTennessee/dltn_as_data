<dc:title>Manuscript related to the presentation of a Congressional Gold Medal to Andrew Jackson</dc:title>
<dc:description>Five pages of handwritten comments concern the presentation of a Congressional Gold Medal to Andrew Jackson. Includes complimentary remarks by President James Madison and Governor Isaac Shelby. It is uncertain whether Jackson himself wrote the reply. </dc:description>
<dc:description>The thanks of Congress and the medal were awarded on February 27, 1815, in recognition of Jackson&#8217;s defense of New Orleans during the War of 1812. The Battle of New Orleans was fought after the Treaty of Ghent was signed, but because of slow transatlantic communications British and American commanders had not yet received word the war was over. Jackson was popular among militiamen who dubbed him &#8220;tough as old hickory wood.&#8221; The battle catapulted "Old Hickory" to the status of national hero.</dc:description>
