<dc:description>The National Recovery Administration (NRA) was a New Deal program created by the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) in 1933. Its goal was to help businesses and workers by setting minimum wages, maximum weekly work hours, and by fixing prices. The NIRA was declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1935 in A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495. The NRA was dissolved as a result. The blue eagle logo of the NRA is, perhaps, one of the most iconic symbols of the New Deal. The Philadelphia Eagles, of the National Football League, were named in honor of the NRA logo.</dc:description>
