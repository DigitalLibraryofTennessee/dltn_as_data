<dc:title>Scene from "Wild River" shows Montgomery Clift and Lee Remick</dc:title>
<dc:description>Two men and a woman walk ahead of a group of African American farm hands. Montgomery Clift, Lee Remick, and an undentified man are passing through a gap in a barbed-wire fence. The three hold hands.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The movie "Wild River" (1960) brought attention to the thousands of Tennesseans who had been forced to abandon their homes and land to make way for the Tennessee Valley Authority. TVA's trouble shooter, Chuck Glover (actor Montgomery Clift) runs into very strange trouble and eminently-worth-the-trouble Lee Remick ("Carol Garth"). At last they have to join hands with the law.</dc:description>
