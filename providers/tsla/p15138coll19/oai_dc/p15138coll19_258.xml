<dc:title>Diagram of U.S. Post Office Property at Nashville, Tenn.</dc:title>
<dc:description>Architectural drawing of the U.S. Post Office in Nashville. </dc:description>
<dc:description>The firm was formed by Thomas Marr and Joseph Holman in 1913. Among the buildings in Nashville designed by the firm are: Belmont Theater, Sulphur Dell baseball park, U.S. Post Office (now the Frist Center for the Visual Arts), Tennessee Home for Feeble Minded Persons  (now Clover Bottom Developmental Center), and Tennessee State Supreme Court. The firm also designed many of the buildings at the Tennessee School for the Deaf in Knoxville. This latter project was of special significance to Marr since he was deaf himself and graduated from the school in 1884.</dc:description>
