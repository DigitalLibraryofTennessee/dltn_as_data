<dc:title>Erosion in Fayette County, Tennessee</dc:title>
<dc:description>Log cabin with side chimney sits atop a hill. It is surrounded by massive hillside erosion.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Drought continued to be a problem in the South throughout the 1930s. Farmers had overproduced crops to the detriment of the soil (and prices), and erosion affected farmers' production ability. Consequently, many farms were foreclosed on during the Great Depression. The FDR administration first attempted to alleviate farm troubles through the Agricultural Adjustment Act, but the Supreme Court nixed it. Congress replaced it with farm-lending programs and instruction in soil conservation methods.</dc:description>
