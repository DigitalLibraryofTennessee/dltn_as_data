<dc:description>By the 1930s, the park area on the Cumberland Plateau was plagued by soil erosion and sub-marginal lands. The Work Projects Administration (WPA), Civilian Corservation Corps (CCC), Resettlement Administration, and U.S. Forest Service worked together to; make the land productive again. The WPA and CCC were work-relief programs that brought much-needed jobs during the Great Depression. The FDR administation's ""alphabet agencies"" were New Deal projects created to alleviate poverty and spur the economy.</dc:description>
