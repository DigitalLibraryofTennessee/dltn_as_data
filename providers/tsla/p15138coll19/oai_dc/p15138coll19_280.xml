<dc:title>Sandbag preparation, Cumberland River flood</dc:title>
<dc:description>Black and white photograph of a soldier walking past a sandbag wall placed next to railroad tracks. The soldier wears a campaign hat with his uniform. In the background are electrical poles and period automobiles. </dc:description>
<dc:description>The photo was probably taken in Nashville during the historic flood of 1937. The Tennessee National Guard and Works Progress Administration (WPA) contributed to the attempt to protect Nashville from flooding. WPA workers built makeshift levees and flood walls, and helped care for refugees. The 105th Observation Squadron (Tennessee National Guard), which took the picture, was re-designated the 105 Airlift Squadron in 1992. </dc:description>
