<dc:title>Telegram from Robert W. Johnson, Chicopee Corporation, to Governor Hill McAlister</dc:title>
<dc:description>Telegram from Robert W. Johnson, President, Chicopee Corporation, to Governor McAlister regarding the National Recovery Administration's code of competition for the textile industry. Johnson does not object to the minimum wage in the code, but to limit on the number of hours a mill's machinery may operate. He argues that the limits will shift textile production from mills in the South to closed mills in the North. He urges Governor McAlister to protest against limiting hours of operation for mills.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The National Recovery Administration (NRA) was a New Deal program created by the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) in 1933. Its goal was to help businesses and workers by setting minimum wages, maximum weekly work hours, and by fixing prices. The NIRA was declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1935 in A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495. The NRA was dissolved as a result. The blue eagle logo of the NRA is, perhaps, one of the most iconic symbols of the New Deal. The Philadelphia Eagles, of the National Football League, were named in honor of the NRA logo.</dc:description>
