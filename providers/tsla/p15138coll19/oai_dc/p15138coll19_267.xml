<dc:title>The critter he got from those Washington Horse Traders</dc:title>
<dc:description>Editorial cartoon by Jack Knox showing a farmer attempting to plow his field with a comically undersized mule/horse. It is titled, "The Critter He Got From Those Washington Horse Traders." It is probably a commentary on the Agricultural Adjustment Administration.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Jack Knox (1910-1985) was a cartoonist for the Evening Tennessean (Nashville), the Memphis Commercial Appeal, and Nashville Banner newspapers.

The Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA) was created after the passage of the Agricultural Adjustment Act in May 1933. The AAA attempted to aid farmers by raising crop and livestock prices through the payment of subsidies to reduce crop production and to kill excess livestock. In January 1936, the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 was ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case United States v. Butler, 297 U.S. 1. The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 rectified the portions of the 1933 act which the Supreme Court had declared unconstitutional.</dc:description>
