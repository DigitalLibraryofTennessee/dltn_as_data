<dc:description>Major-General Andrew Jackson commanded miltia and U.S. Regulars during the Creek War/War of 1812. His greatest victory of the Creek War was made at Horseshoe Bend (in present-day Alabama). His overwhelming success against the British at the Battle of New Orleans (January 8, 1815) brought him to national attention. Jackson was elected president in 1828, and was reelected in 1832.
