<dc:title>Death of General Pakenham scene</dc:title>
<dc:description>Black and white engraving, "Battle of New Orleans and Death of General Packenham [sic]." British and American forces clash as Pakenham falls mortally wounded from his horse. Abandoned cannon at right fallen soldiers and ladder on ground. From John Frost and W. Croome, "Pictorial Life of Andrew Jackson."</dc:description>
<dc:description>Major-General The Honorable Sir Edward Michael Pakenham, commander of British troops at the Battle of New Orleans, was hit by grapeshot and died while being carried off the field, January 8, 1815. Because of slow transatlantic communications, neither Pakenham nor U.S. General Andrew Jackson was aware that the Treaty of Ghent ended the War of 1812 two weeks earlier. Engraved by William Croome who also illustrated Crockett's Almanac.</dc:description>
