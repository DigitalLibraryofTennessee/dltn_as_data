<dc:description>This volume of the "Official Annual of the Civilian Conservation Corps, 'C' District CCC, Fourth Area, 1937" was donated by James O. Rickman of Johnson City, TN. Rickman was with Camp Cordell Hull, Co. 1455, F-5 in the Unaka Range; of the Cherokee National Forest, and it is assumed that he enhanced the CCC insignia on this introductory page with the specifications of his camp. The CCC (1933-1942) employed nearly 3 million men who worked on conservation projects.</dc:description>
