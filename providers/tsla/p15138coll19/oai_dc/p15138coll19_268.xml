<dc:title>"Bluntly, He'd Rather Not Have that Bozo Introduced"</dc:title>
<dc:description>Editorial cartoon by Jack Knox depicting President Franklin D. Roosevelt attempting to introduce the "food subsidy program" to the U.S. Congress. The man depicting Congress is shown replying, "Sorry--But I ain't makin' any new acquaintances." The cartoon is titled, "Bluntly, He'd Rather Not Have that Bozo Introduced." The cartoon is possibly referring to the creation of the Federal Surplus Relief Corporation.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Jack Knox (1910-1985) was a cartoonist for the Evening Tennessean (Nashville), the Memphis Commercial Appeal, and Nashville Banner newspapers.

The Federal Surplus Relief Corporation (FSRC) was created in October 1933. Working in conjunction with the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, it purchased surplus food commodities and distributed them to the unemployed. Its name was changed to the Federal Surplus Commodities Corporation in November 1935. The current federal food assistance and school lunch programs are an outgrowth of the creation of the FSRC.</dc:description>
