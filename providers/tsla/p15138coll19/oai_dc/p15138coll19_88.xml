<dc:description>Clay was a U.S. Representative and U.S. Senator from Kentucky; he also served as Secretary of State. During the War of 1812, he was part of the War Hawk faction that agitated for war with Great Britain. As Speaker of the House, Clay molded the office into the powerful position it is today. When sectional issues rose after the War of 1812, Clay used his political influence to negotiate compromise between special interests. The Great Compromiser served the nation for almost 50 years.</dc:description>
