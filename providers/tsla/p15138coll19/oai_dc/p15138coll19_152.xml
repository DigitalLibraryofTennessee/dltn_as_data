<dc:title>Battle of New Orleans scene</dc:title>
<dc:description>Black and white engraving, "The Battle of New Orleans," depicts Major-General Andrew Jackson atop a white horse and rallying his troops to defend an American position. Visible are a U.S. flag, a cannon and cannoneer, and British troops attacking the rampart. Bottom border is stained.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Jackson's American troops achieved an overwhelming victory against the British in the Battle of New Orleans (January 8, 1815). The Treaty of Ghent had ended the War of 1812 two weeks ealier, but because of slow transatlantic communication, neither Jackson nor British commander Major-General Sir Edward Pakenham had learned the news.</dc:description>
