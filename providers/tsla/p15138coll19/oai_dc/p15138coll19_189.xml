<dc:description>The Battle of New Orleans was a series of clashes for control of the city with combat taking place between December 1814 and January 1815. General Andrew Jackson commanded an American force that overwhelmed the British enemy on January 8, 1815. Because of slow transatlantic communications, neither side was aware that a peace treaty had been signed two weeks earlier.</dc:description>
