<dc:description>The National Youth Administration (NYA) was created in June 1935 through an executive order by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. As part of the Works Progress Administration (WPA), the NYA offered vocational classes to young fulltime students and employed many others in part-time jobs. NYA youth built shops and vocational buildings in twenty-three of Tennessee's counties and gyms and recreational buildings in thirteen others. The NYA was abolished in 1943 when Congress refused to grant it further funding.</dc:description>
