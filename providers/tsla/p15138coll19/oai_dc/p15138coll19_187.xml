<dc:title>Map of the Lands in Mississippi ceded by the Chickasaws to the United States in 1832 and 1834</dc:title>
<dc:description>This map from the survey of Henry M. Lusher shows northern half of Mississippi and adjacent parts of Alabama, Tennessee and Arkansas. The Chickasaw-Choctaw boundary is shown beginning at the Mississippi River as well as Indian settlements, white settlements, roads and trails. The map also shows changes made to the Tennessee-Mississippi border.</dc:description>
<dc:description>In 1818 the Chickasaws gave up their claims to what is now West Tennessee and western Kentucky. In the early 1830s, the Chickasaws ceded over 6,000,000 acres of land in Mississippi in exchange for lands west of the Mississippi River. John Coffee, former general of the Tennessee volunteers during the War of 1812, represented the United States in many of the treaty negotiations with the South-eastern Tribes.</dc:description>
