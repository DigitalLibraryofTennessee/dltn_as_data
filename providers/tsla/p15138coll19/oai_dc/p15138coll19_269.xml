<dc:title>President Franklin D. Roosevelt speaking at the dedication of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park</dc:title>
<dc:description>President Roosevelt stands at a bunting-covered podium that holds several microphones. He faces right as if he is speaking to the guests seated behind him.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Located in East Tennessee and western North Carolina, the park was officially established in 1934 and dedicated in 1941. Men from the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and Works Progress Administration (WPA) played a significant role in creating the park. They built hiking trails and fire watchtowers and improved infrastructure. Not all Tennesseans were happy about the park. Bit by bit the federal government purchased the land from farmers and mountaineers--often at less than acceptable prices--who were evicted.</dc:description>
