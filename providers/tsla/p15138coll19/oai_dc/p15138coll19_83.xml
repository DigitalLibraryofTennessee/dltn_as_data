<dc:description>Black and white steel engraving of James Madison (1751-1836), seated in plush chair with cabriole legs.

<dc:description>Madison, Father of the Constitution and Bill of Rights, was president during the War of 1812. Two years into the fighting, he and the government fled Washington City to avoid capture by the British. His wife Dolley saved the Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington before the British burned the White House and other public buildings. Madison was the last surviving Founding Father when he died in 1836.</dc:description>
