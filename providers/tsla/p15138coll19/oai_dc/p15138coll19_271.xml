<dc:title>Mississippian skeletal remains</dc:title>
<dc:description>Black and white photograph of skeletal remains.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The WPA (Works Progress Administration, later Work Projects Administration) launched archaeological investigations in 1935 to provide jobs during the Depression. Most of the excavations were done in the Southeast, including Tennessee. These scientific investigations contributed to a greater understanding of diverse American cultures, including Mississippian ones. The Cumberland River Valley around Nashville is particularly rich in these types of burial sites. Photograph possibly taken in Humphreys County.</dc:description>
