<dc:description>The Works Progress Administration (WPA) was created in 1935 as a Depression relief measure. For an average salary of $41.57 a month, WPA employees built bridges, roads, public buildings, public parks, and airports. By the time it was dissolved in 1943, the WPA had employed 8.5 million people. In the 1930s workers restored Fort Negley in Nashville. The Federal fortification was originally built in 1862, much of it with slave labor. </dc:description>
