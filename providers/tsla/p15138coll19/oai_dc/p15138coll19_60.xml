<dc:title>Letter from Hannah Morey to James M. Morey</dc:title>
<dc:description>"Dear Son... Wish you could hear Dora and Charly sing. There's a light in the window for thee, brother. It would make you cry, at least it does me.  You ask me not to grieve myself sick for you. I must weep for all the mental and physical sufferings"</dc:description>
