<dc:description>Henry Dearborn (1751-1829) was a veteran of the Revolutionary War, but was a mediocre commander during the War of 1812. Jacob Jennings Brown (1775-1828) had successes in the North during the war that made him a hero. Winfield Scott (1796-1866) became the longest-serving American general in history. Andrew Jackson (1767-1845) was effective in the Creek Campaign and at the Battle of New Orleans. William Henry Harrison (1773-1841) commanded the Army of the Northwest during the war.</dc:description>
