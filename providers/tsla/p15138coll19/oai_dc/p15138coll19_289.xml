<dc:description>The Works Progress Administration (WPA, later Work Projects Administration) offered work to the unemployed on an unprecedented scale by spending money on a wide variety of programs, including highways and building construction, slum clearance, reforestation, and rural rehabilitation. A gigantic undertaking, it was inevitably attended by confusion, waste, and political favoritism, yet the "pump-priming" effect stimulated private business during the Depression and inaugurated reforms that states had been unable to subsidize. During 1935-1943, the WPA employed some 8.5 million people. (Information from Indiana University's online WPA exhibit)</dc:description>
