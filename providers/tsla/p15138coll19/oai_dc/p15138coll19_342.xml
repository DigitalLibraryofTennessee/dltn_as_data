<dc:description>Henion Patterson was an African American from Anderson County at the time he wrote this letter. The CCC was established in 1933 as a means of providing jobs for unemployed young men from relief families. The enlistees planted trees; built bridges, parks, and roads; cultivated forests; constructed fire towers; and drained swamps. Draining swamps went a long way in preventing malaria. The Tree Army employed around 200,000 black men during the Depression.</dc:description>
