<dc:description>The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was one of the first of Franklin D. Roosevelt's "alphabet agencies" designed to ease the effects of the Depression. The CCC was a relief agency that promoted environmental conservation and intended to build good citizens through vigorous, disciplined outdoor labor. It built roads and hiking trails, state parks and forests, fire towers, and other public works. Soil conservation and reforestation were CCC signature efforts. According to the Times-Free Press, the men of "District C" Company 1466 were sent to a work site with no telephone, no electricity, no water source or a tank for storing water, and the wiring for an electric generator was incomplete.</dc:description>
