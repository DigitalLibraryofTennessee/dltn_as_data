  <abstract>Frazer's four-page letter (with postal cover) to Dear Father describes his work and accommodations in a Louisiana CCC camp. Everything about the camp is very pleasant, and the men share two to a tent. Tents have wooden floors and gas heat. We have seen quite a few chameleons. They are very cute. They look like ordinary little lizards but they change color.... [chameleons] have a way of blowing out their throat when they get excited. It opens up just like a fan. Includes writer's primitive drawing of a chameleon. Postal cover included as fifth page.</abstract>
