<dc:title>Raw recruits</dc:title>
<dc:subject>Sheet music covers; Caricatures; African Americans; Soldiers; United States -- History -- Civil War, 1861-1865</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Cover depicts caricatures of five African-American soldiers, three with bayonets, one playing a drum, and one holding a sign reading "Raw Recruits, Capt. Dan Bryant." They appear hapless and comically inept. They are lined up in front of tents in camp. Below title: "or Abraham's Daughter, as sung with great applause by Bryants Minstrels of New York."</dc:description>
