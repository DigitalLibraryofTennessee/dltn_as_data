<dc:description>Jeff Davis fled Richmond, Virginia, in the spring of 1865 when the Confederacy fell to the Union. When he was caught in Irwinsville, Georgia, on May 19, 1865, he was rumored to be dressed in his wife's clothing in order to evade capture. He argued that in the dark he had mistakenly grabbed his wife's raglan when he heard horsemen approaching. Varina Davis, his wife, apparently threw her shawl around his shoulders as well, making it appear as if he were dressed as a woman.</dc:description>
