<dc:description>After the Battle of Gettysburg, a dead soldier was found on the field with an ambrotype of his three young children. The photograph was obtained by Dr. Francis Bourns who then had the photograph reproduced so that someone might be able to identify; the children. It was eventually determined that the father of the children was the late Amos Humiston, of Portville, Cattaraugus County, New York, a Sergeant in the 154th New York Volunteers. The children's names were Frank, Frederick, and Alice.</dc:description>
