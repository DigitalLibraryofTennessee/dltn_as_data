  <abstract>The front cover of the April 1905 issue of Southern Farm Magazine features several paragraphs from Financial Age under the caption "Bringing in Settlers." Framed by engraved imagery of fruits, vegetables, grains, livestock and poultry and the names of Southern states, this cover page draws attention to the efforts of Southern railroad companies to capitalize on transatlantic immigration and to deliver such emigrants into the South to develop ore, farm and timber lands and industry.</abstract>

These images illustrate the development of agricultural practices and methods over a period of more than a century, from Tennessee immigration in the 1830s to the Depression era of the 1930s.  These documents reflect the earliest authors and record keepers’ materials that encouraged immigration for the purpose of agricultural life and encouraged various crop production based on diverse natural resources and advances in the “technology” of nineteenth-century farming.  Photographs of farmers at their trade as well as various other ephemera, including pamphlets, newsletters, and clippings, all highlight the significance of agriculture to the economy and history of Tennessee as it evolved from an untamed wilderness to a thriving member of the New South...</abstract>
