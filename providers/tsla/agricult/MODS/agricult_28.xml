    <abstract>The selection of materials in this collection portrays the lives of Tennessee’s average farmers in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  These images illustrate the development of agricultural practices and methods over a period of more than a century, from Tennessee immigration in the 1830s to the Depression era of the 1930s.  These documents reflect the earliest authors and record keepers’ materials that encouraged immigration for the purpose of agricultural life and encouraged various crop production based on diverse natural resources and advances in the “technology” of nineteenth-century farming.  Photographs of farmers at their trade as well as various other ephemera, including pamphlets, newsletters, and clippings, all highlight the significance of agriculture to the economy and history of Tennessee as it evolved from an untamed wilderness to a thriving member of the New South...</abstract>
