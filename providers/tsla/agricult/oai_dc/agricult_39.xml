<dc:description>Tolbert Fanning, a leading Disciple of Christ and advocate of scientific agriculture,  founded Franklin College in 1845 on the grounds of his farm at the present-day site of the Nashville International Airport.  The agricultural school focused on classroom scientific study of agricuture, horticulture, and the mechanical arts; manual application in the fields; and religious study.  Disrupted by the Civil War, the college was to reopen after the conflict, but was destroyed by fire.</dc:description>
