<dc:description>Tolbert Fanning founded this scientific journal as well as another journal, The Agriculturalist, which was the journal of the State Agricultural Society. He embraced the ideas behind scientific agriculture, and he was also an early leader of the Stone-Campbell movement in Tennessee, a form of Christianity. Franklin College, a manual labor school that included farm work and Bible study, was located five miles east of Nashville.  It was eventually closed down after the Civil War.</dc:description>
