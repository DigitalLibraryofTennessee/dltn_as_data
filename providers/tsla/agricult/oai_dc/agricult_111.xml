<dc:description>The catalog advertised a new type of farm implement used in planting grain and spreading newly developed chemical fertilizers. Before the Civil War about 75-90 labor-hours were required to produce 100 bushels of corn (2-1/2 acres) with walking plow, harrow, and hand planting. By 1870, an expanded market demand for agricultural products brought adoption of improved technology and resulting increases in farm production.</dc:description>
