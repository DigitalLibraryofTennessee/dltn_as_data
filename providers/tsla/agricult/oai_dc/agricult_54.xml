<dc:description>The State Agricultural Society of Tennessee first met in May of 1839 and was incorporated by the General Assembly in 1842. "The Agriculturist" printed its inaugural issue in January of 1840 and debuted as the monthly journal of the Society.  J. Shelby, Gerard Troost, and Tolbert Fanning served as co-editors; they were later joined by F. K. Zollicoffer.  The journal was published through December of 1845.  It was then absorbed by the "Southern Agriculturist."</dc:description>
