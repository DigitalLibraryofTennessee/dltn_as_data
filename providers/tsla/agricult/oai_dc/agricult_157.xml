<dc:description>This type of promotional literature offered an important avenue to explore the historical development of Tennessee and the many opportunities for those interested in settlement.  In the late 1890's and the early 1900's, promotional literature often championed the agricultural, the healthful and cathartic value of the Tennessee climate and geography. This booklet, completed in 1897, was sponsored by Tennessee's Bureau of Agriculture.</dc:description>
