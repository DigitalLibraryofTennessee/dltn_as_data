<dc:description>The "Tennessee Farmer" began operation in 1834 as the first monthly in Tennessee dedicated specifically to the promotion of agriculture.  The publication's first editor, Judge Thomas Emmerson, and prominent Jonesborough merchant, David A. Deaderick, are credited with introducing the first cast iron plow into East Tennessee in 1825. Thomas Emmerson distingushed himself during his lifetime as a jurist, an editor, a mayor,  a businessman and a patron of education and agriculture.</dc:description>
