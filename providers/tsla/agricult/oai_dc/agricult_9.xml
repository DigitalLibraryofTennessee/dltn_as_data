<dc:description>Following the drying of the wheat shocks, thresher crews would arrive in the fields.  Thresher equipment, run by tractor or steam engine would be set up. Workers would then gather the shocks into a wagon and take them to the threshing operation, where they would be fed into the machine. Threshing machines worked faster and supplied a cleaner product than older methods of treading out or flailing.</dc:description>
