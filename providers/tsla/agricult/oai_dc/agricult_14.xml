<dc:description>The Cul-Car-Mac Falls are falls located in Dekalb County, Tennessee, latitude-logitude coordinates of N 35.94506 and West 85.7761. The nearest town is Smithville, Tennessee. James M. Safford of Lebanon, Tennessee, was named State Geologist in 1854. As a professor at Cumberland College in Nashville, Safford in the late 1850s published a report of geological conditions in Tennessee, known as "The Geology of Tennessee." He later adapted this book for use as a state textbook.</dc:description>
