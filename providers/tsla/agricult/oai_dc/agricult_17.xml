<dc:description>The central-hall cottage or I-house is a common example of vernacular architecture in Tennessee dwellings. Such homes date from the early nineteenth through the late twentieth centuries. The exterior was usually frame with gabled roofs and often had gable end chimneys.  The interior consisted of a central hall with symmetrical rooms to either side.</dc:description>
