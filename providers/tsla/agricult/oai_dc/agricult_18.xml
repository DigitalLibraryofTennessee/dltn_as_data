<dc:description>By 1840 Tennessee was the leading corn-producing state in the Union, with 12 percent of the nation's total. Ten years later, the state grew enough corn to feed its three million hogs, the most in the nation.  Corn continued to play a prominent role in post-Civil War agriculture, although prices did not recover to their pre-war level for several decades. In autumn, when the ears of corn were ripe, farmers cut the stalks of corn and stacked them in shocks in the field.</dc:description>
