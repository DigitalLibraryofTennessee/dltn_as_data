<dc:description>From earliest times,Warren County's landscape was heavily populated with oak, chestnut, beech and other nut trees. Jonathan H. H. Boyd, founder of Forest Nursery Company, took note and focused on forest and shade trees and prevailed over those nurseries who focused on apple trees instead. Note that the American chestnut is still being offered for sale at this time;this is prior to the full impact of the chestnut blight that appeared in the U.S. in 1904 and wiped out the U.S. Chestnut trees.</dc:description>
