<dc:description>The Farmers' Alliance made its first appearance in Tennessee in the winter of 1887. In March 1888 farmers organized the Tennessee State Alliance and elected John P. Buchanan, a Rutherford County livestock man, as the first president.  In 1889 the Farmers' Alliance joined the Agricultural Wheel to become the National Farmers' and Laborers' Union. The Alliance urged farmers to adopt scientific and business practices, diversify their crops, and become self-sufficient in order to break the debt cycle.</dc:description>
