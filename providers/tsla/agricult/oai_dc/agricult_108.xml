<dc:description>This circular points up the connection that existed between the railroad companies and the development of agriculture, natural resources, and industrialization.  It definitely behoved the railroad companies to encourage immigration and the sale of ore, farm, and timber lands along their lines.  J. B. Killbrew focused on iron, coal, and railroad interests following his departure from the Bureau of Agriculture in 1880, and he would become an agent for the NC&amp;St.L Railroad in 1894.</dc:description>
