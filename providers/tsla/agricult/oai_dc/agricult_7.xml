<dc:description>The threshing machine (or simply thresher), was a machine first invented by Scottish mechanical engineer Andrew Meikle for use in agriculture.  It was invented (c.1784) for the separation of grain from stalks and husks.  Mechanization of this process took much of the drudgery out of farm labor. About 1910, horse pulled combines appeared and became a success. Later, gas and diesel engines appeared with other refinements and specifications.</dc:description>
