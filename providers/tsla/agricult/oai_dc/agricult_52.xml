<dc:description>The agricultural journal known as the "Rural Record" originated with the March 10, 1882, issue.  Its target audience was to be the farmer, planter and stock raiser, and their families; thus, there were features that appealed to children and housewives as well.  The company that published this journal was headed by Adolph S. Ochs, the businessman who cut his teeth on Chattanooga newspapers, later acquired the "New York Times," and helped establish modern American journalism.</dc:description>
