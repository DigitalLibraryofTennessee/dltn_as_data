<dc:description>In 1872, J. B. Killebrew (1831-1906) became the agricultural editor of the "Nashville Union and American." As a result, in less than a year, a stock company was formed for the purpose of establishing the "Rural Sun," which first appeared in 1872 with Killebrew as editor-in-chief. The newspaper served as organ for the Tennessee Bureau of Agriculture, promoting immigration, development of timber and mineral resources and industrialization. The newspaper ceased publication in 1879.</dc:description>
