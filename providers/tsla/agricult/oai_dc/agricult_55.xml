<dc:description>The Tennessee Agricultural Society formed in May of 1839. "The Agriculturist" premiered in January of 1840 as the Society's journal. Agricultural and scientific indivduals were to benefit from the exchange of ideas, notice of improvements and discoveries dealing with soil analysis, manuring, crop rotation, and livestock advances. The interests of mechanics and ladies were also to be addressed in this journal of applied science co-edited by J. Shelby, G. Troost, T. Fanning, and later F. K. Zollicoffer.</dc:description>
