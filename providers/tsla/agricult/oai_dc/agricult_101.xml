<dc:description>New South advocate and first Tennessee Commissioner of Agriculture, Joseph B. Killebrew, was born May 29, 1831 in Montgomery County, Tennessee.  At Killebrew's urging and in response to the demands of like-minded farmers, the Tennessee General Assembly established a Bureau of Agriculture in December 1871. In 1894 he became immigration agent for the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railroad.</dc:description>
