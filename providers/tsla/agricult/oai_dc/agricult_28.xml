<dc:description>This map demonstrates the rich mineral resources available for potential manufacturers in Tennessee during the nineteenth century. At the time, northern investors were purchasing huge acreages in mineral rich areas of Appalachia.  Tennessee was an early leader in iron ore production. However, by the beginning of the twentieth century, the focus shifted to coal mining.</dc:description>
