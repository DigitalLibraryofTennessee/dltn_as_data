<dc:description>In the antebellum period, many Tennessee farmers pursued what they thought would be a promising commercial opportunity in the production of silk. Fueling their optimism were discoveries in the 1830s that silkworms thrived on the native mulberry tree.These circumstances gave rise to a flurry of interest and activity in the 1830s and 1840s. In 1840 supporters formed the Tennessee Silk Society to promote production of cocoons and use of the fabric. Unfortunately, disease destroyed the small industry.</dc:description>
