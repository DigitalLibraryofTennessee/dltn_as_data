<dc:description>Mules were the key element in Tennessee&#8217;s farm economy. The extension of mule power allowed farmers to handle more land, get over their fields faster and achieve higher productivity. Although tractors made their first appearance in Tennessee during the 1920s, they were initially little more than a curiosity. It wasn&#8217;t until after World War II that mechanization replaced mules on a majority of Tennessee farms.  However, many small farmers were still working with mules well into the 1950s.</dc:description>
