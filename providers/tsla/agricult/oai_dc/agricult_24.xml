<dc:description>The widespread use of horse-powered threshing machines exemplifies the adoption of labor-saving machinery in Tennessee in the post-Civil War era. These machines separated small grain from the stems faster than treading or flailing while producing a cleaner product.  Although cost was a defintie factor, more and more farmers were rejecting the traditional agricultural methods and Tennessee became a flourishing market for horse-powered farm implements.</dc:description>
