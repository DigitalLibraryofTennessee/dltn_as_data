<dc:description>Letter from Commissioner J. B. Killebrew to H. C. Collier of Charlotte, Tennessee, deals with encouraging immigration to Tennessee in the 1880s and the accompanying sale of farm land across the state. Killebrew assures Collier that immigration is not; just to East Tennessee that he matches requests for land to the need; and that counties must advertise resources to garner emigrants. The letter is written on letterhead from the Tennessee Bureau of Agriculture, Statistics, Mines and Immigration.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Killebrew had been pivotal in the establishment of a Bureau of Agriculture for Tennessee in 1871.  He served as the Secretary and took charge of the Bureau's publications. When the Bureau was reorganized in 1875, Killebrew was named the first Commissioner of Agriculture; he served until 1880.  The extended title of the Bureau appearing on the letterhead reveals the widespread responsibilites inherent in the development of agriculture in Tennessee.</dc:description>
