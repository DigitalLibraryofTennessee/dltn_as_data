<dc:description>This image highlights the importance of the mule to the development of Tennessee's farm economy. They would overtake oxen between 1870 and 1880 to become the state's main draft animals and work stock. Advances in machinery allowed for lighter and more  maneuverable plows, and that contributed to the switch from the more powerful oxen to mules and horses.  The relatively light wooden plow being used is most likely to be a cultivating plow, rather than a breaking plow.</dc:description>
