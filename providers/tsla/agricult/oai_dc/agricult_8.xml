<dc:description>The individuals pictured are using hand tools such as cradles, tiers, and shockers to hand-bind this Cannon County wheat crop. These hand tools were employed by farmers in Tennessee prior to the advent of binder machines.  In this case, the terrain may have ruled out the use of such machinery.</dc:description>
