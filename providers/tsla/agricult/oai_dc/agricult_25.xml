<dc:description>Sorghum is a member of the grass family introduced into the United States in 1853. Sorghum also refers to the syrup produced from the juice extracted when the sorghum plant is boiled. The sorghum industry became widespread in the South about the time of the Civil War when food supplies became scarce.  The stalks of the sorghum plant were also used for fodder. Today Tennessee and Kentucky are the leading producers of sorghum.</dc:description>
