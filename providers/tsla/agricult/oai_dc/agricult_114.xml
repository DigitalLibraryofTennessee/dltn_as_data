<dc:description>D. G. Godwin, the Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Agriculture, felt the need to publish this graphically illustrated book to inform homeseekers, capitalists, and students of the products, resources, and capabilities of Tennessee. In doing so, he was following the historical mandate that had evolved for the Department.   Most statistical information that was employed by Godwin came from the 1890 Federal Census figures.</dc:description>
