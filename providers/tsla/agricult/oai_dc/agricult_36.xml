<dc:description>The front cover of the April 1905 issue of Southern Farm Magazine features several paragraphs from Financial Age under the caption "Bringing in Settlers." Framed by engraved imagery of fruits, vegetables, grains, livestock and poultry and the names of Southern states, this cover page draws attention to the efforts of Southern railroad companies to capitalize on transatlantic immigration and to deliver such emigrants into the South to develop ore, farm and timber lands and industry.</dc:description>
