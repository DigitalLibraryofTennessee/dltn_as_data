  <abstract>Group photo taken atop mountain "Block Charlie." The Imjin River and North Korea can be seen in the background. There was a platform built for "War Conferences." From this position, movements of Chinese Units could be observed and plans made for future military action. This photo was taken at the last War Conference, the Peace Truce having been signed a few days earlier. The mountain is located near Panmunjom, where peace negotiations were conducted and concluded, in the 1st Marine Divisions sector of the front lines. The persons in front, left to right, are: General John Hull, Commanding General Armed Forces Far East; General Pate, commanding the 1st Marine Division; General Malone, commanding the 1st Corps headquartered at Uijongbu South of Panmunjom; and General Maxwell Taylor, Commanding General, 8th Army, responsible for all units located on the Korean Peninsula with Headquarters in Seoul, Korea. Inscription of individuals pictured is on reverse.</abstract>
