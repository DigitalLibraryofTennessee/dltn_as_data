  <abstract>This memorandum, dated November 15, 1943, was made by the Commander of the Tennessee Wing of the Civil Air Patrol (CAP), Herbert T. Fox, to the Wing Staff Officers and Unit Commanders. The documents gives nine points of interest discussing a new program to recruit more cadets into the CAP. It mentions one of the top functions of the CAP is to be a training outlet for pilots who will rapidly transfer into service in the armed forces. The document stresses the need for experienced pilots and teachers who can help prepare these young cadets for military service. Of particular interest is number 8, which states that since women are badly needed in the Army, the CAP should enlist as many women as possible to either teach or train those interested in joining the Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron (WAFS).</abstract>
