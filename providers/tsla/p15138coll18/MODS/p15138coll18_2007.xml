  <abstract>This one page letter, from the ladies of the Davidson County branch of the Tennessee Woman's Christian Temperance Union, discusses the lynching of a black man that presumably occurred in Davidson County. While this letter does not give particular names, it states that the ladies were 'positively shocked at the double murder of two innocent men, and yet more so at the ghastly and horrible punishment meted out by white men to a negro brute' who was the alleged murderer. This letter shows the perspective of women involved in the Christian Temperance Union and their strong hatred of liquor which permeates this letter. Of the African American man who was the alleged murderer, the Union wrote that he was "probably crazed by bootlegger's liquor [and] knew not what he was doing when he committed the dastardly crime." The letter goes on to offer Governor Rye sympathy and prayers as he is faced with the hard problem of race relations and the lynching problem.</abstract>
