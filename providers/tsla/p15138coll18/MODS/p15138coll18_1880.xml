  <abstract>In this letter, John Sevier warns settlers living on Indian lands that if they do not leave on their own, they will be forcibly removed by the military. However, he also informs them that every effort is being made to extinguish Indian claims on lands. He says that friendly relations with the Indians must continue in order to obtain their trust and eventually settle on their land peacefully.</abstract>
