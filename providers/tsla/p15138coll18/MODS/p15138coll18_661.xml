  <abstract>This proclamation, directed to the "Law Abiding People of Tennessee," addresses the rebellion and insurrection at Coal Creek. The governor states "Lawless persons in great numbers in East Tennessee, at Coal Creek and vicinity, are in open rebellion and insurrection against the laws and constituted authorities of the State." The proclamation goes on to detail the situation, discussing the civil and military forces participating, and issues a call that "every Sherriff in the State to summon such posses as can be well armed, and do urge all good citizens of the State promptly to respond to such summons, and repair at the earliest possible moment to the scene of conflict...". The document appears to be a draft that may have been used over the course of the lawsuit filed between the State of Tennessee and the Tennessee Coal and Iron Railroad.</abstract>
