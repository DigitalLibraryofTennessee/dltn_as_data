  <abstract>This land indenture and certification of land appraisal details the transfer of land in Alabama from a Creek woman named Oher kobbe to David Hubbard. She received $360.00 from David Hubbard for her lands. On the back is the certification of the land deed, which states she sold about 120 acres to Hubbard and describes how many acres of land were good, fair or unfit for cultivation. The certification is signed by Certifying Agent Leonard Tarrant.</abstract>
