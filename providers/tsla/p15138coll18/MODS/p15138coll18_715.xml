  <abstract>This detailed report provides information on the progress of yellow fever in two patients, Miss Lizzie Rhodes, age 19 and Arnold Rhodes, age 5, who were siblings. For Miss Rhodes, Dr. Tyner lists her temperature and pulse from her initial "attack" on August 19th until her death on August 23rd. He notes "She had black vomit 21st 4 p.m. which continued till death. She also had suppression of urine. Her condition was very favorable until the death of her brother, when her nervous system became so excited as to render her recovery hopeless." Arnold Rhodes fell ill on August 20th at 1 a.m.. Dr. Tyner records his temperature and pulse until his death 48 hours later, on August 21st. Arnold Rhodes experienced similar symptoms but the doctor notes that his temperature must have risen above 104 1/2 degrees for his death to have occurred so quickly. Dr. Tyner also notes that "These cases were more malignant than any I have seen in the city." He concludes by saying that he had kept the patients isolated and then burned all their clothing and bedding after death and that the father informed him that no other members of his family had been "attacked" by yellow fever.</abstract>
