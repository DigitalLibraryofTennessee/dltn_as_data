  <abstract>In this letter, Mary Frazer explains the roles of a night guard and the hours and events of their duty. Then she states they slept for a short time, but the officer of the day woke them up saying there was a patient suffering from insanity that had escaped from the nearby Naval Hospital and they had to go out and be on guard. She describes this guard duty, where they went and who they encountered and what the protocol would be if they found the man. The letter is dated as "Sunday."</abstract>
