  <abstract>Mary Frazer begins her letter by stating the Women Reservists were recently given a tour of a Landing Craft - Infantry (LCI) and Landing Ship - Tank (LST) that were docked at Quantico. She discusses the building materials, size and weapons of the LST. She also mentions going horseback riding and having dinner with Eugenia Lejeune, daughter of famed General John A.
