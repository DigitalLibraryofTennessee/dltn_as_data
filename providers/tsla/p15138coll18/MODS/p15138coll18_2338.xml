  <abstract>This document is a copy of a letter sent to the Memphis Press-Scimitar from three women representing the Women's Christian Temperance Union in Halls, Tennessee. The letter denounces the policy of the newspaper The Press-Scimitar in Memphis toward the cause of prohibition and suggests they are on the side of the "wets". The authors reference an article that appeared on the front page titled "Peay, Bone Dry, Given Whisky to Save Life" and proclaim it as propaganda.</abstract>
