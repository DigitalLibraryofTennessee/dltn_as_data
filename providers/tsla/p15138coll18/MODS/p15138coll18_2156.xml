  <abstract>This letter was written by the Secretary of War, Samuel Cooper, to Tennessee Governor Newton Cannon suggesting he may need to supply soldiers to General Winfield Scott to serve as a guard to escort the Cherokee people to the West. He expresses concern that there could be hostile behavior against or by the Cherokees during their removal and General Scott has the authority to request forces from Tennessee if needed.</abstract>
