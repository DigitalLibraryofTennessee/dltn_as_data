  <abstract>This episode of the Abbie an' Slats daily comic features a newly uniformed WAAC (Women's Army Auxiliary Corps) recruit named Peggy Turner who is on a date with an Army private. While out, an older civilian couple notices Peggy and discusses what kind of woman joins the military. The traditional thoughts about gender roles are evident here when one of the onlookers suggests Peggy must have little regard for her dignity as a woman to have joined the military and wear a manly uniform. Her date overhears and counters the man's argument saying Peggy's uniform "gives her more dignity than any gown she ever wore!" He continues stating that it is an honorable thing for her to release a man to fight in the war.</abstract>
