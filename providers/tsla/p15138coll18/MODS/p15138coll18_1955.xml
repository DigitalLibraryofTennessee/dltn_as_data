  <abstract>This poster from World War I shows a fashionably dressed young woman holding a soda fountain glass. The straw in her glass has passed through the bottom and into the ocean. She is pulling ships labeled "Sugar" back to the United States through the straw, away from a fleet of ships headed to Europe labeled "Arms," "Supplies," "Soliders," and "Food." Europe is shown under a cloud labeled "War" in the distance, and a soldier on the European shore is gesturing toward the ships and saying "Hurry!" The text of the poster reads, "Sugar means Ships. The consumption of sugar sweetened drinks must be reduced. For your beverages 400 million lbs. of sugar were imported in ships last year. Every ship is needed to carry soldiers and supplies now."</abstract>
