  <abstract>In this message, Governor Isham Harris shares his thoughts on seceding from the Union in 1860. Referencing resolutions adopted by the legislatures of South Carolina and Mississippi, he mentions the loyalty of Tennesseans to the Constitution but continues on to discuss Tennesseans' "jealous regard for the rights of the States" and their "feeling justly apprensive of encroachments upon them." He continues to say that Tennesseans would "feel and demonstrate, when necessary, their identity with any of her sister states in resisting any unjust and unconstitutional warfare upon them or their institutions." Harris states that resistance should at first be consitutional but suggests that if justice were difficult to attain, "to follow the example of our fathers of 1776, will be the only alternatives left us." He closes with a statement that Tennessee's policy should be to exhaust every means consistent with honoring the Constitution in an effort to check the the tide of agression and restore good feeling throughout the whole country.</abstract>
