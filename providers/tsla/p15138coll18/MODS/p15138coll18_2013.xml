  <abstract>This two page letter is a plea from two members of the Shelby County Criminal Court staff. This letter concerns a man named Ell Parsons who was charged with raping and murdering a white girl. Puryear and Harsh explained how fear for Parsons' life and the risk of lynching in Shelby County caused him to be transferred to the Davidson County jail, although threats persisted against his life upon his return. Even the sheriff was threatened and the fear of his lynching was so great that he also fled Shelby County. This letter is an appeal to Governor Rye to send the Militia to Shelby County to protect against the lynching mobs.</abstract>
