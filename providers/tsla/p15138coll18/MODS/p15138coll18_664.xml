  <abstract>This document was submitted as part of a larger brief detailing the issues in the case between the Tennessee Coal and Iron Railroad Company and the State of Tennessee. It identifies the issues as follows: "Arrearages on rental, expenses paid by State for apprehension and return of escaped convicts, and the military expenses incurred and paid by the state." In August 1892, the State of Tennessee sued the Tennessee Coal and Iron Railroad Company (TCIR) over issues related to the convict lease. John A. Pitts, of Pitts and Meeks, whose letterhead this document was printed on, was Solicitor General for Tennessee. He alleged that TCIR owed the state $147,000 for back rental, the arrest and return of the convicts released by the miners in the fall of 1892, and the expenses the state incurred in maintaining a military presence during the rebellion. Negotiations continued on for over a year before the State and TCIR agreed to a settlement.</abstract>
