  <abstract>The Superintendant of Quarantine John Johnson writes this letter to the President of the State Board of Health, J.D. Plunket, to discuss the depths of graves in a cemetery called Elmwood which contains yellow fever victims. Johnson is worried because the grave diggers in that cemetery were digging graves only four and a half feet deep. He suggests that the graves be dug five and a half feet deep because drainage from the Elmwood cemetery goes right through the city of Memphis.</abstract>
