  <abstract>Letter from William Polk to Gideon Pillow. William Polk, President James K. Polk's brother, writes from Mexico City during the height of the Mexican- American War to his friend, General Gideon Pillow. The letter is about a recent scandal between General Pillow and the Commander of Forces in Mexico, General Winfield Scott. Scott had Pillow court martialed for exaggerating his role in several battles. In this letter, Polk reassures Pillow that his friends in the military in Mexico are sure that his innocence will soon be proven.</abstract>
