  <abstract>This World War II recruiting poster for the Women's Army Corps features a woman in a knee-length blue uniform dress carrying a covered tray of medical supplies. Behind her are metal-framed hospital beds. The poster encourages women to enlist in hospital companies to perform Army hospital duties. In smaller print it states that women can be assigned to other fields within the Women's Army Corps. It also gives application information.</abstract>
