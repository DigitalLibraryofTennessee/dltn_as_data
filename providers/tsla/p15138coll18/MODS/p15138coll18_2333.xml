  <abstract>This piece of correspondence from Martin Boyd of Newbern, Tennessee is found in Governor Austin Peay's papers. It references publicity found in the newspaper The Press-Scimitar of Memphis suggesting that Governor Austin Peay received a stimulant in the form of intoxicating liquor when he was ill. Mr. Boyd suggests that the "manner in which this commonplace information is presented arouses suspicion that an attempt will be made to get the prohibition laws modified" and poses the question, "Can it be that the Press-Scimitar desires a return of the 'prescription saloon'?"</abstract>
