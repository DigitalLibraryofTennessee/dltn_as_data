  <abstract>Superintendent Andrew Wood states in this letter that he believes "...that the state of Tennessee, with its own laws upholding prohibition, can very well undertake to demonstrate the interest which it has in promoting law and order in its various communities." It is Superintendent Wood's opinion that there should be state officers who can cross county lines to apprehend "rum runners" and "automobile speeders." He references a law enforcement conference held by the Governor and Attorney Generals of the State to discuss the enforcement situation and the President of the United State's comments that "States assume more of their responsibility in the enforcement of the prohibition amendment."</abstract>
