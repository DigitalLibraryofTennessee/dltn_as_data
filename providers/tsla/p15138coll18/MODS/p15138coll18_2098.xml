  <abstract>This 16-page letter written by U.S. Secretary of War John Eaton to the Cherokee delegation gives the view of President Andrew Jackson on the Cherokee Nation's concerns. He responds to their claims that Georgia is overreaching their authority with the statement that during the Revolutionary War, the Cherokees allied themselves with Great Britain. Eaton claims that when Great Britain was defeated, the individual states gained sovereignty over the lands controlled by Great Britain, which included Cherokee territory within the states' borders, and that the Cherokees were subject to the states' authority and have been permitted by those states to live on and use the land. He goes on to state that the oppression from Georgia is a result of the Cherokee people's attempt to establish themselves as an independent nation within the boundaries of Georgia. He claims Georgia is within its constitutional right as established by the treaty of 1783, ending the Revolutionary War, to exercise authority over all within the boundaries of the state, and the federal government cannot take that right away from the states. He suggests that the Cherokees' only option is to remove to the West because staying within the territory of a state will only continue the oppression. Eaton relates the feelings of President Jackson towards the Cherokee people saying it is the President's desire for the Cherokee people to relocate to a land where they can be free to maintain their traditions and society and the U. S. government can protect them from the encroachment of American citizens.</abstract>
