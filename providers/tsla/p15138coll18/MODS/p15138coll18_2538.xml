  <abstract>This document is a sample contract that would could be executed between the landowners Richard Ewell, Lizinka Ewell, and Campbell Brown (son of Lizinka Ewell) and freedmen to be later named. The contract deals with the Melrose Plantation in Bolivar County, Mississippi. The guidelines include that the landowners would furnish mules, wagons, ploughs, farming utensils, feed for the mules, and ration for the working hands and any necessary expenses of the farm. The freedmen to be identified would work the first four days of every week for the landowners and would work two days a week on their own crops. Every working hand would be given two and a half acres of land to work free of rent.</abstract>
