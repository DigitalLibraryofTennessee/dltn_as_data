  <abstract>This is a picture of a two-story log structure with a stone chimney and covered porch. The structure is located at the foot of a tree-covered hill with two trees in front. All of the trees are barren. In the foreground of the picture there is a wooden fence. There is a sign on the front porch that reads, "Tom Thumb Miniature Gold Course." In the top lefthand corner there is an insert that contains a sketch of Cherokee Chief John Ross. The stamp in the bottom right hand corner reads, "Cline Studios, Chattanooga." The caption of the whole image reads, "The John Ross House, Rossville, Georgia."</abstract>
