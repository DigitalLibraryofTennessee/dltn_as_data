  <abstract>This political cartoon was drawn by the famous Tennessean newspaper artist, Jack Knox. The drawing shows a man holding two large baskets of food on his shoulders. The baskets are each marked with a "V" for victory. The back of the man's shirt states, "'plant to prosper' farmers." In the background of the drawing is a barn labeled "Mid South" and another man indicated as "John Public" who is tipping his hat to the farmer. A scroll at the top of the drawing states a quote from Secretary of Agriculture Wickard: "Food will win the war."</abstract>
