  <abstract>Letter dated July 12, 1918 in which the Nashville chapter of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters &amp; Joiners petitioned Governor Tom C. Rye to remove Theodore Hoepfner, a German-born American citizen, from his post as Assistant Factory Inspector of the Western Division of Tennessee. In addition, they suggested that "every man that has any German ties should be relieved of any Elective or Appointive Office" and replaced by a man born in the United States. Earlier, the Memphis chapter of this union had sent a similar letter alleging Hoepfner had started fires at factories in Memphis. The letter is signed by W. E. Cheers and E. E. Woodward, Business Agent.</abstract>
