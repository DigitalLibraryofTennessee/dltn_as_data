  <abstract>A petition written by the citizens of Williamson County to Governor William Carroll regarding the pardon of a slave named Harry who has been convicted of the attempted murder of his master. The citizens believe Harry should be pardoned because he was forced into the act by Sam, another slave. The citizens clarify that this petition is not the result of a master concerned about losing a valuable piece of property, but an attempt at justice.</abstract>
