  <abstract>In this letter 4-page letter, Cherokee Chief John Ross writes to Martin Van Buren regarding confusion over a treaty made with the Cherokee Council's approval. He states that he and Edward Gunter were supposed to meet with John Mason, a representative of the American government, for an informal negotiation before the formal delegation was to meet in an effort to create a treaty. He explains that they were baffled to receive word that negotiations had been closed before they had even been opened, and a circular informing the Nation about a treaty made was sent to the Nation. He states that he presented a protest about this treaty to Congress but they told him to present it to the President. He closes his letter by saying that, since the proposal for a treaty in which the Cherokees would be able to keep their lands and become citizens of the United States was rejected by the U. S. Government, the Cherokee viewed it necessary to enter into a treaty of cession.</abstract>
