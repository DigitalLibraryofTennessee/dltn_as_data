  <abstract>John Williams Overton, 2nd Lieut., 119th Co., 1st Replacement Battalion, USMC, writes to his sister and her husband about his experience as am American soldier in the United States Marine Corp. stationed in France during World War I. Throughout the letter, he only identifies his location as "France" and also writes that he is not allowed to tell them anything. He refers to the arrival of the battallion on the 40/8 box cars frequently used to transport American soldiers in France during World War I. He also writes of attending an infantry school in a nearby town and meeting a French woman there and of his concern for his sister's health. He mentions billeting with a local farm family and how eager his company is to get into the fight. This letter is written four months before his death during the Second Battle of the Marne in France on July 18, 1918.</abstract>
