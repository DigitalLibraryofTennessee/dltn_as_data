  <abstract>In this letter, Jean Anderson thanks the Frazers for sending a box of chocolates for Christmas and explains she used the gift as a treat for a party she helped host. She mentions that they had been questioning what to serve at the party because Americans were unable to buy food in France and the chocolates arrived just in time for the occasion. She then goes on to describe her latest job with the Red Cross's Civilian War Relief Department in France. She states the Red Cross is working to find a solution to help the thousands of displaced persons who are being liberated as the Allied forces advance. They travel across the country taking supplies to displaced persons camps, often relying on inadequate transportation because the resources were depleted by the Germans. Anderson expresses her admiration for the persistence of the Russian people to continue to fight after the turmoil they have faced at the hands of the Axis Powers. She mentions a letter she received from Preston and the work the 2nd Armored Division is doing in Europe and requests news of the other family members.</abstract>
