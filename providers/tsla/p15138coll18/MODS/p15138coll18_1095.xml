  <abstract>This letter is a response from Andrew Jackson to Governor John Sevier challenging him to a duel. According to the letter, Sevier spoke poorly of Jackson's wife Rachel, who had accidentally married Jackson before she was legally divorced from her first husband. Jackson wrote, "... In the town of Knoxville did you take the name of a lady into your polluted lips... and how sir in the Neighborhood of Knoxville you shall atone for it or I will publish you as a coward and a poltroon." This letter is part of a larger exchange between Jackson and Sevier, who wrote his own duel challenge to Jackson and accused him of trying to run away.</abstract>
