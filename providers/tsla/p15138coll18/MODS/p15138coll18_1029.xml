  <abstract>This letter, from attorney A.H. Gray of Haywood County, expresses appreciation to Ellington for his work in the Federal Supreme Court case regarding voting rights in Fayette and Haywood Counties. In 1929 and 1949, Gray was a State Senator representing Haywood and Fayette counties. In this letter, Gray writes about the Federal Government s response to the voting crisis: [i]t seemed that the Justice Department was determined to make us suffer as much as possible and the Final Judgement that was entered was in the form of a permanent Injunction against about fifty Haywood County landowners and businessmen. However, Gray goes on to write, the Government went against its earlier promise, which, as he understood it, was to the effect that those cases would be dismissed without any Injunction going down against us provided the County Court here would take over the issuance of free food during the emergency periods of the year.</abstract>
