  <abstract>This graduation party invitation provides all of the information about the time and location of the event in the format of military strategic orders for battle. The invitation begins with the General Situation in which it states that the Company C, 6th Basic Class, AGOS, U.S. Marine Corps has maintained its position for eight weeks and has encountered heavy resistance, including "poison ivy, wood ticks, chiggers...." The General Situation claims there is one last stronghold of opposition remaining, located at Hill BOQ, and states orders have been given to make an assault at nightfall to gain control. The invitation goes on in the Special Situation to recount the Commanding Officers orders and plan for attack, providing the order, time and locations for each event of the "assault." The final section of the invitation lists the Requirement, in which it summarizes the invitation information for the party. The document is typed on the front and back of the invitation. On both the front and back of the invitation the original dates state 26 July 1944 but the 26 has been marked out and 24 is written in place of it.</abstract>
