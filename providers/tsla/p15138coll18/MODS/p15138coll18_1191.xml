  <abstract>This cartoon was featured in the July 3, 1942 issue of the Vultee Volunteer to remind employees to conserve their tires by using their cars as little as possible and make their tires last during the rationing. The drawing depicts a woman driving a car that, instead of tires, is being supported by her husband, a cat and a dog. The license plate says, "1944," and the husband's comment is, "You know, dear... sometimes I wish we'd gone easy on our tires back in 1942."</abstract>
