  <abstract>Article written by Cornelia Fort that describes her experience on Pearl Harbor Day when she and a student almost collided with a Japanese Zero on its bombing run. She details seeing the smoke from the battleships in the harbor and the moment of realization that they were under attack. She describes how she came to join the Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron (WAFS), after returning to the United States. Fort attempts to put into words the feelings that she got while flying and her desire to use her talents as a pilot for her country during World War II. Though Fort wrote this article, it was published posthumously in the Women's Home Companion magazine in 1943, a few months after her death, and includes a picture of her in her flight helmet. The article has since been republished in various newspapers.</abstract>
