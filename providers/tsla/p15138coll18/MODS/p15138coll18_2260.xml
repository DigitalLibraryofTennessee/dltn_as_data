  <abstract>Mary Washington Frazer begins this letter by describing a dance she attended with fellow Women Reservists and Coast Guard officers. She thanks her mother for recent letters containing family news and then begins describing two field trips. The first trip was to the Dog Training Detachment where they showed the usefulness of the dogs on the front lines, as attach dogs and as escorts under fire. The second field trip was to the Firing Range where the women were shown how to shoot the carbine. They shot the gun at a target and she tells how accurate she was at shooting. Then she describes the noise of the bullets. She mentions their weather, her hopes for requesting some leave to go to Washington, D.C., and ration coupons. This letter is hand-written on stationery from Marine base Camp Lejeune in New River, North Carolina.</abstract>
