    <topic>Polk, James K (James Knox), 1795-1849</topic>
  </subject>
  <abstract>This is a folk song about the presidential election of 1844, in which the darkhorse Democratic candidate James K. Polk defeated more established Whig candidate Henry Clay. The song humorously speaks against Polk with lyrics like "Ha! Ha! Such a nominee as Jimmy Polk of Tennessee" and "They poked it to the cunning elf by poking Jimmy Polk himself." This song was likely propoganda written and circulated by Polk's political opponents in the election. These types of propoganda materials, like music sheets, were widely popular because they were so easy to spread to the public.</abstract>
