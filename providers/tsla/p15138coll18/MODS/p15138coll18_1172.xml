  <abstract>Video interview of Jean Prueher by Susan Gordon of the Tennessee Historical Society. In this clip, Gordon asks Prueher to describe her motivation for joining the Red Cross. Prueher's response is that when she moved to Nashville, she wanted to be a part of the war effort and the Red Cross needed people to give out doughnuts on the train. She says that the trains would come through town carrying soldiers that seemed to be so young to her at the time and she would push doughnuts and candy bars though the windows and the boys would lean out of the windows and talk with them. She also states that, though she does not know if this was organized by the Red Cross, her church in downtown Nashville used its fellowship hall as a place where soldiers from the Classification Center, Camp Forrest and Fort Campbell could sleep and eat breakfast on Sunday mornings.</abstract>
