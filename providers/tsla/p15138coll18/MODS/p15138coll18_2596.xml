  <abstract>Letter dated July 29, 1917 to John V. Wright from his presumed neighbor and landlord, Frances O. Smith. In the letter, Smith describes her anxiety over the military draft and wonders which boys from Bolivar will be drafted. She mentions her fear for the boys, but also her pride claiming that the war would be much worse if "our boys were not willing to come to the rescue."</abstract>
