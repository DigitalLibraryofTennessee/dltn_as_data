  <abstract>Newspaper article reviewing the events of 1943 and their impact on women in the United States. The article discusses important events for women and their careers, both in the armed forces and in industry. The article starts out by saying 1943 presented many challenges to women - in the armed forces recruitment was down, and in the workforce women found it difficult to work and take care of the home. However, it continues by saying that by mid-autumn women had proven their capability to face the added pressure. The article also references the debate of that time to include women in the draft. Also included is an illustrated collage of various women's positions.</abstract>
