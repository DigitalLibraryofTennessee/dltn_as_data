    <topic>Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching</topic>
  </subject>
  <abstract>This four page pamphlet discusses why women formed the Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching and why they stood against lynching, specifically the lynching of blacks by white men. From 1921-1930, 211 lynchings were conducted. After the Association was founded in 1930, 21 lynchings took place that year. This pamphlet also gives lynching statistics through 1938 which saw the lowest number of lynchings until that time. This work argues against the common myth that lynchings were conducted to protect white women. This work also gives examples of how real women were instrumental in preventing lynchings.The publication ends by describing how the Association was working with law enforcement to sign a pledge to educate against lynchings and prevent mob action.</abstract>
