  <abstract>Article discussing the hot-topic debate of whether or not women should give up their industry jobs after the war to make positions available for returning male veterans. The author references several surveys taken among women workers who are divided in opinion about keeping their jobs or returning to their homes. The article gives the opinions of several male soldiers on the subject, most of which hold more traditional views of what women's work should mean. The article also features several images of the various jobs women have been holding.</abstract>
