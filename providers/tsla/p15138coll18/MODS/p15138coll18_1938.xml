  <abstract>Trade agreement between the United States government and the Chickasaw and Choctaw tribes sanctioned by Southwest Territory governor William Blount. The agreement states that boat captain David Moore will transport goods given to these tribes by the United States in Philadelphia. The goods willl be transported from the Holston River to the mouth of Bear Creek on a flat bottomed boat powered by six oarsmen. Opoca Mingo, a Chickasaw leader, and several others of his tribe will be on the boat to help to direct it. David Moore is given special instruction to protect the Chickasaws on board as well as their goods, especially from parties of hostile Cherokees and Creeks. The agreement does not provide specifics on what types of goods are being transported.</abstract>
