  <abstract>This poster provides two images to interpret the experience of rationing during World War II. The image at the top of the poster features two women at the butcher, one clearly claiming more than her fair share, and is meant to represent what the experience would be like without rationing. The image at the bottom of the poster features the same two women. Each woman is holding a ration book, the butcher is holding ration stamps, and each woman holds the same amount of food.</abstract>
