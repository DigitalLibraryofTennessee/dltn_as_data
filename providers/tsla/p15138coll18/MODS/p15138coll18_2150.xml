  <abstract>This is a short, handwritten letter, transcribed by John Ross, dictated by Path Killer, a Cherokee Chief. This letter, or "talk," by Path Killer to Tennessee Governor Joseph McMinn is in reply to a request made by the United States for the Cherokee Nation to cede all lands east of the Mississippi. Path Killer rejects the Governor's proposal for the Cherokees to remove west of the Mississippi and states that the Cherokee people are, as a whole, opposed to the idea of surrendering their lands. He assures the Governor and the President of the United States that the Cherokee people are still allied with the U. S. and request the "mercy &amp; protection" of their white brothers. The letter was written for the Raleigh Register.</abstract>
