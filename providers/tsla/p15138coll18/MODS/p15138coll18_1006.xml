  <abstract>British Lt. Henry Timberlake traveled to the Overhill Cherokee villages on the Little Tennessee River in late 1761 to explain the provisions of a peace treaty between an army of Viriginia colonists and a party of Cherokee leaders that had been signed at Fort Robinson on the Holston River earlier in that year. He remained with the Cherokee until March 1762, keeping a journal that was subsequently published in England in 1765. In addition to this map, his journal contained a detailed account of Cherokee customs. He later accompanied several Cherokee leaders, including Attakullakulla, the Little Carpenter, to London to meet with King George of England.</abstract>
