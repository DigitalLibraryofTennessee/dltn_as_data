  <abstract>As part of a Tennessee Historical Society project documenting and interpreting "Home Front Tennessee: The World War II Experience", Mrs. Rubye L. Fowler of Cookeville submitted this six page personal essay in response to a series of questions intended to explore an individual's experience here in Tennessee during World War II. Ms. Fowler served in the United States Marine Corps Women's Reserve. Titled "Uncle Sam Has a Heart", Mrs. Fowler constructs this essay in the form of a conversation with her granddaughter telling her stories about applying for Officers' Training in the Marine Corps Women's Reserves and her assignment at the Mail and File Division at the Marine Corps Headquarters in the Navy Annex in Washington, D.C.</abstract>
