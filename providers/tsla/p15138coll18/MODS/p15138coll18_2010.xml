  <abstract>This two page letter is from Reverend J.A. Jones, a former slave who was once owned by a prominent white Tennessee family. Jones, also an elder of a Nashville African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church, discussed the lynching of a black man that occurred in Lexington, Tennessee. Not only did Jones reflect on this lynching, he also compared the lynching in Lexington to a lynching that occurred in Estill Springs, Tennessee. Jones particularly looked at the Estill Springs event and explained how a white posse, led by a former sheriff, turned the black man over to the "hands of an 'orderly,' infuriated crowd of respectable citizens, who proceeded to hang him." Written during World War I, Jones mentioned the African American soldiers fighting overseas and his desire to make the home front a safe place for them and a place that is worthy of them defending with their lives. At the end of his letter, Jones appealed to Governor Rye to bring those responsible for the lynching to justice.</abstract>
