  <abstract>Adam Fergusson writes this 4-page letter to his wife, Hester Ann, to update her on the status of their farm. He begins by saying he arrived and everything is safe, but the harsh frost makes growing cotton difficult. He describes the local economy and growth. Of particular interest is a description of an encampment of Creek Indians from Alabama waiting to cross the river at Memphis, Tennessee, on their journey of removal to the Indian Territory.</abstract>
