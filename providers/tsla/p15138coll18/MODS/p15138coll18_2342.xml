It states that Stokely Hutchings is a male inhabitant of the State of Tennessee of the age of twenty-one years, a citizen of the United States, and a resident of Madison County for six months. The document also affirms that two competent witnesses who are known to the Commissioner of Registration for Madison County as "unconditional Union men" are personally acquainted with Stokely Hutchings and verify that he has never been guilty of any of the disqualifications specified in the Act of February 25, 1867.</abstract>
