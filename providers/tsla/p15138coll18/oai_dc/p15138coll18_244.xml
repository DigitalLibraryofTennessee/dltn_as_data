<dc:description>During World War II, Americans were frequently called upon to salvage raw materials for the war effort. Frequently, Tennesseans participated in salvage drives to collect materials such as rubber, paper, silk, cooking fat, iron, steel, aluminum, and more. Salvage drives represented a way that Tennesseans could participate in the war effort at home and also built a sense of patriotism among the home front.</dc:description>
