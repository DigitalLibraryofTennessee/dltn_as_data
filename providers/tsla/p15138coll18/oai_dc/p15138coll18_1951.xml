<dc:title>Boys and Girls! You can help your Uncle Sam win the War</dc:title>
<dc:description>This poster from World War I shows Uncle Sam holding a girl and standing next to a boy. Uncle Sam is offering war savings stamps to the children. The text of the poster reads, "Boys and Girls! You can help your Uncle Sam win the War. Uncle Sam is holding a Save your Quarters. Buy War Savings Stamps."</dc:description>
<dc:description>Children joined their parents in supporting the United States during World War I by buying war savings stamps, or thrift stamps, each worth 10 to 25 cents. When an individual had filled their stamp book or pamphlet, stamps could be traded in for a 5 dollar War Savings Certificate Stamp. Like the liberty loan war bonds created by U.S. Secretary of the Treasury William Gibbs McAdoo, these stamps paid interest, which encouraged children to save and invest their money in the war effort.</dc:description>
