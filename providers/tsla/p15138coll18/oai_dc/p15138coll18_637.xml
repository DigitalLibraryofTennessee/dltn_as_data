<dc:description>During World War II, Americans were frequently called upon to salvage raw materials for the war effort. Tennessee created the Tennessee State Defense Council to cooperate with the federal government on its National Defense Program. One of its activities was to aid in the rationing of products. Many counties in Tennessee also created rationing boards. Robert Boyte Crawford Howell served as the chairman of the War Price and Rationing Board in Davidson County from 1942-1945 during the World War II era.</dc:description>
