<dc:title>Letter from John Sevier to settlers living on Indian lands</dc:title>
<dc:description>In this letter, John Sevier warns settlers living on Indian lands that if they do not leave on their own, they will be forcibly removed by the military. However, he also informs them that every effort is being made to extinguish Indian claims on lands. He says that friendly relations with the Indians must continue in order to obtain their trust and eventually settle on their land peacefully.</dc:description>
<dc:description>John Sevier served as a colonel during the Revolutionary War and led several Tennessee militias into battles against the Cherokee and Chickamagua. By 1798, he was governor of the newly-formed state of Tennessee. In the late 1700s, territorial clashes between white settlers and American Indians including the Cherokees and Chickasaws led to a hostile and often violent environment between the two groups. Several series of treaties between the United States government and tribal governments were signed in an attempt to establish boundary lines and prevent further violence.</dc:description>
