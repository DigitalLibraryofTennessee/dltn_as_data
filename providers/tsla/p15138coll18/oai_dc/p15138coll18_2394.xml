<dc:title>The Bootleg Era...an interesting, constructive series depicting some "dark pages" of Nashville history during the Bootleg Era of the late teens and the roaring twenties</dc:title>
<dc:description>This publication of the Nashville Banner features a series of articles about the prohibition era in Tennessee. Written in 1957, the author appears to take his information from past articles of the Nashville Banner newspaper as well as the messages of the Governor's of Tennessee. The authors reports on inviduals arrested, bootlegging locations and operations, and general response to the 18th amendment in Tennessee. </dc:description>
<dc:description>The Prohibition movement was organized in the middle of the 19th century as part of a religious movement. As its popularity increased, several states banned consumption of alcohol. The 18th Amendment (passed 1917, ratified 1919) and the Volstead Act (passed 1920) both supplemented the movement, attempting to ban all alcohol in the United States. The 21st Amendment repealed the Prohibition laws in 1933.</dc:description>
