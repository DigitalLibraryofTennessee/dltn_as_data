<dc:description>Blues is a musical form and genre that originated in African American communities in the rural U.S. South, particularly the Mississippi Delta, around the end of the 19th century. It developed from a fusion of traditional African music and European folk music, and incorporates spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts and chants, and rhymed ballads.</dc:description>
