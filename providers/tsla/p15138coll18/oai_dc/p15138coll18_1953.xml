<dc:title>Help him win by saving and serving</dc:title>
<dc:description>This poster from World War I shows General John J. Pershing, commander of the American Expeditionary Forces, holding the hands of two children, a boy and a girl. General Pershing is dressed in his military uniform. The text of the poster reads, "Help him win by Saving and Serving. W.S.S. War Savings Stamps issued by the United States Government. Buy War Savings Stamps."</dc:description>
<dc:description>Children joined their parents in supporting the United States during World War I by buying war savings stamps, or thrift stamps, each worth 10 to 25 cents. When an individual had filled their stamp book or pamphlet, stamps could be traded in for a 5 dollar War Savings Certificate Stamp. Like the liberty loan war bonds created by U.S. Secretary of the Treasury William Gibbs McAdoo, these stamps paid interest, which encouraged children to save and invest their money in the war effort.</dc:description>
