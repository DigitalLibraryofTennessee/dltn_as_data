<dc:title>Statement by Dr. Hanson Catlet</dc:title>
<dc:description>A document related to Andrew Jackson's duel with Charles Dickinson.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Andrew Jackson's quick temper led him into several personal confrontations over the years, the most notorious being an 1806 duel with Charles Dickinson. The dispute was over a horse race that escalated after Dickinson made some remarks about Rachel. At the duel, Jackson was gravely wounded by Dickinson's bullet and for the rest of his life the bullet was lodged in his body. While Jackson survived the duel, his opponent Charles Dickinson was killed. This statement is by Dr. Hanson Catlet who was testifying that the duel was conducted as it had been agreed between the two men.</dc:description>
