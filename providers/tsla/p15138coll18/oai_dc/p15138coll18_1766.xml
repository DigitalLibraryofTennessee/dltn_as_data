<dc:description>Tennessee, which in 1890 had nearly seventy thousand working children between the ages of 10-15, was one of the first states in the country to pass legislation putting restrictions on the use of child labor. In 1893, Governor Peter Turney signed into law House Bill 6, which made it illegal to employ children under the age of twelve in "work-shops, mines, mills, or factories in this State." In 1901, House Bill 545 raised the minimum age to fourteen. However, the field of agriculture, in which the vast majority of the state's working children were employed, was not covered by either law.</dc:description>
