<dc:title>Memoranda of issues submitted in the case of Governor John P. Buchanan, et als. vs. Tennessee Coal and Iron Railroad Company, et als.</dc:title>
<dc:description>This document was submitted as part of a larger brief detailing the issues in the case between the Tennessee Coal and Iron Railroad Company and the State of Tennessee. It identifies the issues as follows: "Arrearages on rental, expenses paid by State for apprehension and return of escaped convicts, and the military expenses incurred and paid by the state." In August 1892, the State of Tennessee sued the Tennessee Coal and Iron Railroad Company (TCIR) over issues related to the convict lease. John A. Pitts, of Pitts and Meeks, whose letterhead this document was printed on, was Solicitor General for Tennessee. He alleged that TCIR owed the state $147,000 for back rental, the arrest and return of the convicts released by the miners in the fall of 1892, and the expenses the state incurred in maintaining a military presence during the rebellion. Negotiations continued on for over a year before the State and TCIR agreed to a settlement.</dc:description>
<dc:description>On July 14, 1891, three hundred miners who worked in the towns of Briceville and Coal Creek in Anderson County, TN congregated and marched to the Tennessee Coal Mining Company's stockade outside Briceville. The stockade housed 40 convicted criminals who had been leased to the company by the state to work as convict laborers. These convicts took jobs previously held by local miners. The miners took control of the convicts, marched them to Coal Creek and boarded them on a train bound for Knoxville. This incident began a year-long rebellion aimed at convincing the state to end the convict-lease program that began in 1866. Rife with abuse, the convict lease program held convicts that were primarily African American. Prison conditions were deplorable with bad food, poor sanitation, and brutal treatment of inmates. When Governor John P. Buchanan called a special session of the Tennessee State Legislature in August to consider the issue of convict leasing, the legislature resolved to abolish convict leasing once the current contract expired. The miners felt like more could be done. Rebellion continued until the 1893 Tennessee General Assembly passed legislation to construct a new state penitentiary and abolish convict leasing in 1896.</dc:description>
