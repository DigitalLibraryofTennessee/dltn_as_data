<dc:title>Letter to John V. Wright from Frances O. Smith regarding the draft</dc:title>
<dc:description>Letter dated July 29, 1917 to John V. Wright from his presumed neighbor and landlord, Frances O. Smith. In the letter, Smith describes her anxiety over the military draft and wonders which boys from Bolivar will be drafted. She mentions her fear for the boys, but also her pride claiming that the war would be much worse if "our boys were not willing to come to the rescue."</dc:description>
<dc:description>The federal government enacted the Selective Service Act on May 18, 1917. The act allowed the government to raise an army for World War I efforts through a system of obligatory enlistment. All American males from the age of 21 to 30 were required to register for the draft. The federal government later expanded the age range to include men from age 18 to 45. More than 61,000 Tennesseans were drafted into service.</dc:description>
