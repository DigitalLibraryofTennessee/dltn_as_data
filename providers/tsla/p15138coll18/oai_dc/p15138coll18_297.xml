<dc:title>Letter to Governor Prentice Cooper from K. D. Nichols and R. G. Cornell</dc:title>
<dc:description>Letter dated July 31, 1943 to Governor Prentice Cooper from Colonel K. D. Nichols and Lieutenant Colonel R. G. Cornell of the Corps of Engineers. Nichols and Cornell apologize to Governor Cooper for a letter sent by Colonel Thomas T. Crenshaw, Corps of Engineers, which questioned Tennessee's willingness to provide the federal government with the land to build Clinton Engineer Works, also known as Oak Ridge.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Governor Cooper responded positively to this letter and was invited to tour the Clinton Engineer Works site on November 3, 1943 with General Leslie R. Groves of the Manhattan Engineering District and Nichols, who had been promoted to the title of District Engineer. By this time, Oak Ridge had become the headquarters of the Manhattan Project.</dc:description>
