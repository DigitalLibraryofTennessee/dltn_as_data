<dc:description>Scientist, inventor, statesman, printer, philosopher, musician, and economist.  In 1784, discontent settlers in Colonial North Carolina's western counties formed a separate, independent state and named it  "Franklin." The December 1784 Provisional Constitution of Jonesborough used "Franklin," and the Second Constitutional Convention at Greeneville in November of 1785 fixed the name of the state at the request of John Sevier as "Franklin," in honor of Benjamin Franklin.  Sevier sought to curry the favor of Benjamin Franklin for the new state and wrote him a letter revealing the honor and requesting his support. Franklin, in Europe at the time, acknowledged the tribute in a 1787 letter to Sevier, but offered no further recognition. The State of Franklin existed from 1784 to 1788.</dc:description>
