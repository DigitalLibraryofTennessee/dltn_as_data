<dc:title>Letter from Mary Washington Frazer to her parents describing two field trips during basic training</dc:title>
<dc:description>Mary Washington Frazer begins this letter by describing a dance she attended with fellow Women Reservists and Coast Guard officers. She thanks her mother for recent letters containing family news and then begins describing two field trips. The first trip was to the Dog Training Detachment where they showed the usefulness of the dogs on the front lines, as attach dogs and as escorts under fire. The second field trip was to the Firing Range where the women were shown how to shoot the carbine. They shot the gun at a target and she tells how accurate she was at shooting. Then she describes the noise of the bullets. She mentions their weather, her hopes for requesting some leave to go to Washington, D.C., and ration coupons. This letter is hand-written on stationery from Marine base Camp Lejeune in New River, North Carolina.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Because of the volume of soldiers needed on the front lines during World War II, the United States government allowed women to fill non-combatant positions in the military in order to release as many men as possible for fighting. Every branch of the military incorporated women into their ranks in some fashion. The Marine Corps was the only United States military branch that provided any kind of combat training to its Women's Reserve during basic training. The Director of the Women's Reserve believed an introduction to combat training would give the women a better understanding and appreciation for what the men they were releasing for duty would be facing on the front lines. In 1948, with the Armed Forces Integration Act, women were made a permanent part of the military, although combat roles remained officially closed to women until 1994.</dc:description>
