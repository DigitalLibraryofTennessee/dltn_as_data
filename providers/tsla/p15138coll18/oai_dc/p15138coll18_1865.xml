<dc:title>Resolution in relation to the Texas annexation</dc:title>
<dc:description>Copy of a resolution by the General Assembly of Ohio which states that it does not support the annexation of Texas to the Union.</dc:description>
<dc:description>In 1845, the state of Texas was annexed to the United States by President James K. Polk. Prior to the annexation, many Americans opposed taking Texas into the Union because it was a slave holding state and it would contribute to the growing hostility between slave states and free states. Americans also feared that the annexation of Texas could lead to war with Mexico.</dc:description>
