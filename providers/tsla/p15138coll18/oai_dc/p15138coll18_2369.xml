<dc:description>Daniel Boone was the most famous and influential of the "long hunters" who explored the western reaches of the Virginia and North Carolina colonies prior to the Revolutionary War. These areas became the states of Tennessee and Kentucky in the 1790s. Boone's most famous exploit was to pioneer a route through the Appalachian mountain ranges of eastern Tennessee and southeastern Kentucky that became known as "the wilderness road." This route ran west from Virginia just below the northern border of Tennessee until it reached the Cumberland Gap, where it turned turned north to pass through the Gap into Kentucky. This road was the principal route used by settlers migrating from Virginia and the Middle Atlantic states into the "Bluegrass" areas of Kentucky.</dc:description>
