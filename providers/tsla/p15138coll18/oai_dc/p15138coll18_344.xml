<dc:title>Letter from Mr. and Mrs. Jesse L. Byrn to Governor Frank Clement</dc:title>
<dc:description>This letter is from Mr. and Mrs. Byrn, white Tennessee residents, who support both Clement's decision to send the National Guard to Clinton, TN and desegregation as a whole. Mrs. Byrn includes an inspiring story of her conversation with some neighbor children concerning school integration. One particularly impactful quote comes from one of the boys: They [African American children] have as much right to an education as I have, and I would do nothing to keep them from going to our school and would help them all I could.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Clinton High School, located in Clinton, Tennessee in Anderson County, was the first school in the state to be integrated in 1956 following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education. There were twelve African-American students who enrolled in the school in the fall of 1956, and they became known as the "Clinton 12." During the integration in the fall of 1956, Clinton was the site of anti-integration riots and protests, including the involvement of notorious white supremacist John Kasper. After the violence escalated on September 1, the National Guard was called into Clinton to keep the peace and protect citizens.</dc:description>
