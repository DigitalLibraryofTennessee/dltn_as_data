<dc:description>The Industrial Revolution was a period of time from the 1760s to the 1840s. During this time, people transitioned from using hand production methods to using machinery. With improved mechanization, Americans witnessed the rise of the factory system. Some of the factories that emerged during the early nineteenth century included textile mills that used steam or water power to spin cotton into yarn and thread.</dc:description>
