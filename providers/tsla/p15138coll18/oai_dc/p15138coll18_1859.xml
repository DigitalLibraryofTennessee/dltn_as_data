<dc:title>"Table IV - Summary of Age at Beginning of Work, by Industries," 1888 Fourth Annual Report of the Commissioner of Labor (U.S.): Working Women in Large Cities</dc:title>
<dc:description>This is a chart showing the beginning age of working women, categorized alphabetically by industry. Ages start at "Under 7" and 7, and proceed to 45 and "Over 45." There is a distinct concentration of numbers between ages 7 and 25.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This table of women's ages at the beginning of work is an excellent example of the use of female and child labor. The concentration of starting ages between 7 and 25 shows how prolific the use of children for labor became in the late nineteenth century. Growing numbers and factory standards such as these, coupled with moral, religious, and political outrage led to the institution of child labor laws.</dc:description>
