<dc:description>This postcard shows an African American man sitting on a cotton bale that is ready to be loaded on the steamboat at the water front.</dc:description>
<dc:description>During the 1800s, West Tennessee, similarly to the Mississippi River Delta, emerged as an agricultural region dominated by slave plantations growing a cash crop for export. Cotton was the cash crop of choice in West Tennessee because the plant was well suited to that region's climate and soil. Most of the cotton was shipped down the Mississippi River to New Orleans, where it was loaded on ocean going vessels and sent to the textile factories of England and New England.</dc:description>
