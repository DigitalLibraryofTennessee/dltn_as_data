<dc:title>Letter from D.B. Puryear and T.W. Harsh to Governor Thomas C. Rye</dc:title>
<dc:description>This two page letter is a plea from two members of the Shelby County Criminal Court staff. This letter concerns a man named Ell Parsons who was charged with raping and murdering a white girl. Puryear and Harsh explained how fear for Parsons' life and the risk of lynching in Shelby County caused him to be transferred to the Davidson County jail, although threats persisted against his life upon his return. Even the sheriff was threatened and the fear of his lynching was so great that he also fled Shelby County. This letter is an appeal to Governor Rye to send the Militia to Shelby County to protect against the lynching mobs.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Jim Crow Laws were policies and regulations regarding segregation of African Americans in the United States from the Reconstruction Era through the 1960s. Jim Crow laws dictated segregation in all aspects of life, including transportation, housing, entertainment, and access to things such as water fountains and entryways to buildings. Jim Crow was mainly prevalent in the Southern states, but was also found in some Northern states. The landmark Supreme Court case of Plessy v. Ferguson in 1892 resulted in the legal mandate of "separate but equal," a main tenant of Jim Crow. Although Jim Crow laws were very restrictive, African Americans were further persecuted by groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and other hate groups. Often, African Americans were lynched as a form of "justice" for alleged crimes. Lynchings were violent occurrences that often became town spectacles that citizens would attend much like a performance.</dc:description>
