<dc:title>Decorated for bravery - awarded the Bronze Star for action in Russia</dc:title>
<dc:description>Article announcing that Lt. Josilee Vest Callahan has been awarded the Bronze Star medal for her actions as a chief surgical nurse in Russia. The American base where she was stationed was attacked, but she continued to perform her duties, providing medical aid in an emergency operation for a wounded soldier. </dc:description>
<dc:description>Because of the volume of soldiers needed on the front lines during World War II, the United States government allowed women to fill non-combatant positions in the military in order to release as many men as possible for fighting. Every branch of the military incorporated women into their ranks in some fashion. Stars and Stripes was a daily periodical published by the U.S. Armed Forces for military personnel stationed in the European Theater of Operations. The Bronze Star Medal is awarded to military persons for heroic or meritorious achievement in combat zones. Women in any branch of the military during World War II were not allowed to participate in combat. However, many female medical personnel stationed in Europe were close to combat and were often underfire or even taken as prisoners of war. </dc:description>
