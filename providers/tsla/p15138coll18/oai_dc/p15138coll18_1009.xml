<dc:title>Archaeological investigations reveal stone chimney foundations -- with fireplaces -- Fort Loudon</dc:title>
<dc:description>A black-and-white photograph showing several rectangular stone foundations composed of rough-cut white stone  </dc:description>
<dc:description>The photograph was taken by Hobart Cooper, who served as supervisor of the 1936-1937 excavations of the Fort Loudon site.  These foundations were the only structures that survived from the original British fortifications constructed in 1756-57.   It is uncertain whether the fort was actively destroyed by the Cherokee after the Bristish surrender in 1760, or simply allowed to fall into ruin by weathering and neglect.  The excavation of the stone foundations allowed archaeologists to locate a line of wooden barracks built to house the British garrison.  The stone foundations may still be seen in the reconstructed fort at the Fort Loudoun State Historic Area near Vonore, Tennessee.</dc:description>
