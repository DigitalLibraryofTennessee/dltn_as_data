<dc:title>Talk made by Path Killer to Governor Joseph McMinn regarding a request for the Cherokees to cede all lands east of the Mississippi</dc:title>
<dc:description>This is a short, handwritten letter, transcribed by John Ross, dictated by Path Killer, a Cherokee Chief. This letter, or "talk," by Path Killer to Tennessee Governor Joseph McMinn is in reply to a request made by the United States for the Cherokee Nation to cede all lands east of the Mississippi. Path Killer rejects the Governor's proposal for the Cherokees to remove west of the Mississippi and states that the Cherokee people are, as a whole, opposed to the idea of surrendering their lands. He assures the Governor and the President of the United States that the Cherokee people are still allied with the U. S. and request the "mercy &amp; protection" of their white brothers. The letter was written for the Raleigh Register.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Path Killer was the last hereditary chief of the Cherokee tribe of Native Americans. John Ross was a member of the Cherokee Council and later became the first elected Cherokee chief. Though this letter was written before the Indian Removal Bill was enacted, it is a good example of the longterm pressure applied to the Native Americans to cede their lands and move to the west.</dc:description>
