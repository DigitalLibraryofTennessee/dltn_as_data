<dc:title>Constitution of the Colored Farmers National Alliance and Co-operative Union of the United States</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pamphlet containing the printed constitution of the Colored Farmers National Alliance</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Colored Farmers  National Alliance and Cooperative Union was the natural result of the Alliance s refusal to allow membership to black farmers, who faced the same rising prices and stagnant profits that plagued all agricultural pursuits. Formed in 1886, the organization absorbed colored wheels in numerous states, including Tennessee, and surged to a membership of 1.2 million by 1891. Although they shared the general aims and philosophy of the Farmers  Alliance, the two found themselves at odds over certain legislation; discontent was furthered by a proposed, and ultimately failed, strike of black cotton-pickers. Lacking significant political clout of their own, the Colored Alliancemen were courted by the People's Party in the early 1890s.</dc:description>
