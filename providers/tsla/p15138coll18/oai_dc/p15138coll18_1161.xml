<dc:description>Newspaper article announcing Cornelia Fort's death in a plane crash on March 21, 1943.

<dc:description>Cornelia Fort was the first female pilot in Nashville to earn her pilot's license. Before the United States entered World War II, she worked as flight instructor and was giving a lesson in Hawaii when she nearly collided with a Japanese plane headed for Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Shortly after, Fort returned to the United States and was the second woman to join the Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron (WAFS). She became the first woman to die in military service during WWII when her airplane collided with another aircraft during a ferrying mission.</dc:description>
