<dc:title>"It's a long way to get the Kaiser" by Hettie Butler</dc:title>
<dc:description>Patriotic song written by Hettie Butler of Martin, Tenn. during World War I and sent to Governor Tom C. Rye. This song celebrates the United States' military involvement in the conflict and emphasizes social and political motivations for entering the war, such as protecting liberty and democracy. It is intended to be sung to the tune of "It's a Long Way to Tipperary."</dc:description>
<dc:description>During World War I, communities across the United States regularly participated in Liberty Sings. The purpose of these events were to boost patriotic spirit, bring communities together, and encourage people to participate in local and national war efforts, such as Liberty Loan drives. American musicians and citizens alike were inspired to compose their own tunes in support of the United States and its military.</dc:description>
