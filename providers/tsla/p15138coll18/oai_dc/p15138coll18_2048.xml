<dc:title>Draft of treaty for cession and Cherokee removal dated 1838</dc:title>
<dc:description>This is a draft of the treaty the Cherokee Nation developed after the Treaty of New Echota was made. It is hand written by Chief John Ross and there are several places left blank for negotiations. This treaty was an effort to gain better terms for the removal west. It contains 11 articles (although Article 11 is mislabeled at Article 12) as follows: the Cherokees cede all their lands east of the Mississippi to the United States; the United States will pay a certain sum (left blank) for the land; another sum (left blank) for expenses of removal; a fee will be paid to the Cherokee for previously exchanged land; the improvements made by the Cherokees east of the Mississippi will be assessed by the U.S. Agents and Cherokee delegation and paid for by the Cherokees; the Cherokees will withdraw no later than 2 years from ratification; the U.S. will protect the Cherokee during removal; the Cherokees will vacate Georgia first with the understanding that the U.S. will pay an allowance for lost crops; and all Cherokees imprisoned will be released and allowed to remove with the rest of the nation under the same conditions.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the American government continually pressed the Cherokee Nation to cede their ancestral lands and remove to lands west of the Mississippi River. The Cherokee Council, led by Chief John Ross, ardently opposed the idea of removal. However, in 1835, a minority group of Cherokees supporting removal negotiated with the United States without the approval of the Cherokee Council. This fraudulent treaty, which became known as the Treaty of New Echota, ceded all Cherokee lands to the United States and allotted two years for the voluntary relocation of the Tribe. The Cherokee Council made several attempts to renegotiate an approved treaty over the following two-year period when the enforced removal began in 1838.</dc:description>
