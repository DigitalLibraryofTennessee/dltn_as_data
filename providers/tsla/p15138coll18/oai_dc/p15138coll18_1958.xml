<dc:title>Save and serve the cause of freedom</dc:title>
<dc:description>This poster from World War I lists four ways that individuals can ration and substitute food needed for soldiers. The text of the poster reads, "Save-1. Wheat-use more corn 2. Meat-use more fish and beans 3. Fats-use just enough 4. Sugar-use syrups-and serve the cause of freedom."</dc:description>
<dc:description>The U.S. Food Administration sought to supply American and Allied troops with food supplies during World War I by instituting voluntary rationing initiatives. Herbert Hoover, the director of this administration, worked to inspire Americans to ration by disseminating posters, articles, workshops, and other materials that taught Americans food substitution and discouraged waste. He also implemented voluntary Meatless Mondays and Wheatless Wednesdays to conserve needed supplies.</dc:description>
