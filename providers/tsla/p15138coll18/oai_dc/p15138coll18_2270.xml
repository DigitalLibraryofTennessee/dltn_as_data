<dc:title>Letter from E. C. Franklin to Mary Washington Frazer regarding life in the United States Marine Corps Women's Reserve</dc:title>
<dc:description>In her letter, Franklin describes the trails of her new assignment including long hours, difficult grading of exams, and living quarters. She explains that the Marines have been split up among the Navy's Women's Reserve in lodging. She compliments the closeness of the educational campus to several large cities and the recreational facilities. She shares news of fellow Marines, asks Frazer how her leave at home went, and tells her about the new theme song they have adopted entitled, "Take us back to New River."</dc:description>
<dc:description>Because of the volume of soldiers needed on the front lines during World War II, the United States government allowed women to fill non-combatant positions in the military in order to release as many men as possible for fighting. Every branch of the military incorporated women into their ranks in some fashion. The United States Marine Corps Women's Reserve (MCWR) were authorized in July, 1942, when the Navy created its women's reserve, Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES). However, the MCWR was not formed until February of 1943. At the end of WWII, most of the women who had enlisted were discharged and expected to return to traditional feminine roles. However, small numbers of women remained a part of each branch and were able to continue their military careers. The MCWR was made a permanent part of the U.S. Marine Corps in 1948 with the Armed Forces Integration Act.</dc:description>
