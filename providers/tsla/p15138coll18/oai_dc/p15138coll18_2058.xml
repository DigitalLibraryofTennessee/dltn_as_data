<dc:title>Letter from John Ross to President Martin Van Buren regarding a treaty made without approval</dc:title>
<dc:description>In this letter 4-page letter, Cherokee Chief John Ross writes to Martin Van Buren regarding confusion over a treaty made with the Cherokee Council's approval. He states that he and Edward Gunter were supposed to meet with John Mason, a representative of the American government, for an informal negotiation before the formal delegation was to meet in an effort to create a treaty. He explains that they were baffled to receive word that negotiations had been closed before they had even been opened, and a circular informing the Nation about a treaty made was sent to the Nation. He states that he presented a protest about this treaty to Congress but they told him to present it to the President. He closes his letter by saying that, since the proposal for a treaty in which the Cherokees would be able to keep their lands and become citizens of the United States was rejected by the U. S. Government, the Cherokee viewed it necessary to enter into a treaty of cession.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the American government continually pressed the Cherokee Nation to cede their ancestral lands and remove to lands west of the Mississippi River. The Cherokee Council ardently opposed the idea of removal. However, in 1835, a minority group of Cherokees supporting removal negotiated with the United States without the approval of the Cherokee Council. This fraudulent treaty, which became known as the Treaty of New Echota, ceded all Cherokee lands to the United States and allotted two years for the voluntary relocation of the Tribe. At the end of this two-year period, in 1838, the U. S. Government began forcibly removing the Cherokee people to their new territory in the West.</dc:description>
