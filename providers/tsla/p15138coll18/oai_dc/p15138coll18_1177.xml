<dc:title>Cornelia Fort, early Tennessee aviator present at the attack on Pearl Harbor.</dc:title>

<dc:description>Cornelia Fort was the first female pilot in Nashville to earn her pilot's license. Before the United States entered World War II, she worked as flight instructor and was giving a lesson in Hawaii when she nearly collided with a Japanese plane headed for Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Shortly after, Fort returned to the United States and was the second woman to join the Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron, a predecessor of the Women's Airforce Service Pilots. She became the first woman to die in military service during WWII when her airplane collided with another aircraft during a ferrying mission. Because of the volume of soldiers needed on the front lines during World War II, the United States government allowed women to fill non-combatant positions in the military in order to release as many men as possible for fighting. Every branch of the military incorporated women into their ranks in some fashion. In the Army Airforces, women were hired to ferry military aircraft across the United States for the government.</dc:description>
