<dc:title>Daily report from Inspector T.J. Tyner, M.D. to J.D. Plunket, M.D., president of the State Board of Health, Nashville, Tenn.</dc:title>
<dc:description>This detailed report provides information on the progress of yellow fever in two patients, Miss Lizzie Rhodes, age 19 and Arnold Rhodes, age 5, who were siblings. For Miss Rhodes, Dr. Tyner lists her temperature and pulse from her initial "attack" on August 19th until her death on August 23rd. He notes "She had black vomit 21st 4 p.m. which continued till death. She also had suppression of urine. Her condition was very favorable until the death of her brother, when her nervous system became so excited as to render her recovery hopeless." Arnold Rhodes fell ill on August 20th at 1 a.m.. Dr. Tyner records his temperature and pulse until his death 48 hours later, on August 21st. Arnold Rhodes experienced similar symptoms but the doctor notes that his temperature must have risen above 104 1/2 degrees for his death to have occurred so quickly. Dr. Tyner also notes that "These cases were more malignant than any I have seen in the city." He concludes by saying that he had kept the patients isolated and then burned all their clothing and bedding after death and that the father informed him that no other members of his family had been "attacked" by yellow fever.</dc:description>
<dc:description>J.W. Ross, the Assistant Superintendant of Quarantine instructed physicians in October 1878 to make daily reports that would provide full, covering details of everything done related to cases of yellow fever. Those reports were submitted to J.D. Plunket, President of the State Board of Health in Nashville. Yellow Fever devastated the city of Memphis in the 1870s. In 1873, 2,000 were killed by the disease. When the disease returned in late July 1878, 25,000 residents fled the city. Between August and October of 1878, the disease killed more than 5,000 people. Towns along the railroads leading out of Memphis also experienced significant losses due to the epidemic. Yellow Fever caused fever, chills, hemorrhaging, severe pain, a yellowing of the skin, and vomit that was black in color.</dc:description>
