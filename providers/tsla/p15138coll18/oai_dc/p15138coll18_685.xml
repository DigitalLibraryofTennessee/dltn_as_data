<dc:title>Old Joe said to young Joe</dc:title>
<dc:description>This World War II era poster features two images, "Young Joe", a soldier, and his father "Old Joe". The image is meant to suggest what a farmer would be saying to his soldier son about what is at stake in the war. Between the two images is an hourglass featuring the sands of time. The text below the images provides quotes that "Old Joe said to Young Joe..." and includes statements about why soldiers fought, what their home situations might have been, what their educational backgrounds might be, and the power of America. The poster is an advertisement for Republic Steel and appeared in several newspapers. According to the reverse of the poster, more than 30 million people would see the advertisement in various farm newspapers and magazines. This copy of this poster was mailed to the Honorable Joe Carr, Secretary of State for Tennessee during the World War II era.</dc:description>
