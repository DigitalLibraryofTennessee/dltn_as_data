<dc:title>Statement of Robert A. Degen</dc:title>
<dc:description>Typed, four-page statement by Robert A. Degen of Sewanee (Tenn.) supporting Highlander Folk School and comending its programs and activities. Degen frequently visited the school and discusses his positive experiences, particularly with guest speakers, such as Eleanor Roosevelt. He believes that ""it is most important for the Committee to know that Highlander is a place where the ideals of democracy as we know them in the United States are cherished"".</dc:description>
<dc:description>Inspired by Danish Folk Schools, Highlander Folk School was founded by Myles Horton in 1932 near Monteagle, Tenn. The early workshops at Highlander educated mine, mill and timber workers on labor issues, literacy and voter's rights. As the civil rights era emerged, Highlander led workshops on desegregation. As the popularity of the school grew, it attracted the leaders of the civil rights movement: Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Rosa Parks and Revered Ralph Abernathy. Because of the school's involvement in southern labor issues and civil rights, it was deemed a "Communist training school" and was investigated by the Federal Government.</dc:description>
