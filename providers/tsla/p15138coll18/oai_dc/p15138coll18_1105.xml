<dc:description>The Mexican- American War lasted for a year and a half, from spring of 1846 through the fall of 1847. Mexican military forces invaded southern Texas, which had recently been annexed into the United States, in the spring of 1846 in an attempt to reclaim some of their former territory. President Polk responded by asking Congress to declare war and appointed General Winfield Scott to command the U.S. troops. U.S. forces eventually defeated the Mexican troops and Mexico signed a treaty giving the California Territory to the United States.</dc:description>
