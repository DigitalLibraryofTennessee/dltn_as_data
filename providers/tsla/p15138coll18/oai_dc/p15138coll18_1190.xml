<dc:title>Civil Air Patrol enlarged cadet recruit program memorandum</dc:title>
<dc:description>This memorandum, dated November 15, 1943, was made by the Commander of the Tennessee Wing of the Civil Air Patrol (CAP), Herbert T. Fox, to the Wing Staff Officers and Unit Commanders. The documents gives nine points of interest discussing a new program to recruit more cadets into the CAP. It mentions one of the top functions of the CAP is to be a training outlet for pilots who will rapidly transfer into service in the armed forces. The document stresses the need for experienced pilots and teachers who can help prepare these young cadets for military service. Of particular interest is number 8, which states that since women are badly needed in the Army, the CAP should enlist as many women as possible to either teach or train those interested in joining the Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron (WAFS).</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron (WAFS) was an auxiliary unit of the Air Transport Command of the Army Air Forces. It was eventually merged with the Women's Flying Training Detachment to become the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASPs). Shortly before United States entrance into World War II, the Civil Air Patrol was created as an civilian auxiliary to the United States Army Air Force. Its purpose was to provide air support for patrols, training and other activities. Youth were encouraged to join the program to gain experience that would benefit them in classification and service after enlisting in the military. </dc:description>
