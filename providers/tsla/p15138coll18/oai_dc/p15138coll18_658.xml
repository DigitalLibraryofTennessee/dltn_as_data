<dc:title>Letter to General William Trousdale from Benjamin F. Allen</dc:title>
<dc:description>In this letter to his father-in law, Benjamin F. Allen writes about the successes and membership of the Know-Nothing party. He says "The Know-Nothings wage war against foreigners and Roman Catholics, and have for their motto 'Americans must rule America.' They advocate principles in direct conflict with the free institutions of our country, and they must fall (as I think) as rapidly as they have risen." He goes on to talk about his own efforts to run for political office and offers details on his wife Louisa's illness.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Benjamin F. Allen married William Trousdale's daughter, Maria Louisa. Between 1853 and 1857, William Trousdale served as the United States ambassador to Brazil. Benjamin F. Allen managed William Trousdale's finances while he was in Brazil.</dc:description>
