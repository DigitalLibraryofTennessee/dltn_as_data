<dc:description>Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the American government continually pressed the various tribes of Native Americans to cede their ancestral lands and remove to lands west of the Mississippi River. President Andrew Jackson, often referring to himself as a father or brother to the Native Americans, believed the best hope for the survival of the Native American tribes was removal and signed the Indian Removal Act of 1830 which authorized the U. S. Government to negotiate with the Native American tribes treaties for the cession of lands and removal west.</dc:description>
