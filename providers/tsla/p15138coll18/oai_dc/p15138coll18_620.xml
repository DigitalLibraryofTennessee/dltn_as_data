<dc:title>Letter from Chief Old Tassel of the Overhill Cherokee to his Elder Brother, the Governors of Virginia and North Carolina</dc:title>
<dc:description>Photostat of a two-page handwritten letter interpreted and written for the Overhill Cherokee chief Old Tassel to his "Elder Brother" (the Governors of Virginia and North Carolina) detailing the injustices heaped upon his Native American tribe by the infringement and encroachment of white settlers.  In this case, Old Tassel is specifically referring to the offenses of "a new people," residents of the newly formed State of Franklin.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This letter from Overhill Cherokee chief Old Tassel to the white powers that be illustrates the angst suffered by the Native Americans in the vicinity of the State of Franklin by, not only white encroachment, but also the conflicting treaties that had arisen in the area. The confusion that the chief describes with treaty negotiations refers to the differing interpretations by participants in the June 1785 Treaty of Dumplin Creek. A token delegation of Cherokee attending John Sevier's negotiations on behalf of the State of Franklin contended they only agreed to allow white settlers present south of the French Broad River to remain. The Franklinites interpreted the treaty as opening the entire area between the French Broad and the Little Tennessee for settlement.  The negotiations Old Tassel referenced being held "by orders of the great men of the thirteen States" took place in November of 1785, and resulted in the Treaty of Hopewell with the United States government that ignored Franklin's Treaty of Dumplin Creek.  Continued encroachment of white settlers into Native American lands and these conflicting treaties turned sporadic clashes into warfare and sparked atrocities from both sides--one of them being the killing of Old Tassel in 1788.</dc:description>
