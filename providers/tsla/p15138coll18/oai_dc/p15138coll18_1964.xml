<dc:title>Ready for Work at Box Factory</dc:title>
<dc:description>Photograph of two women from the Old Hickory Powder Plant Box Factory dressed in their work uniforms, called "womanalls." One of the women is seated on a box, presumably made at the factory. In the accompanying article published in the Old Hickory News, the women's foreman describes the women as "doing a man's work at a man's pay and doing it better than a man can do."</dc:description>
<dc:description>After the Selective Service Act of 1917 was passed, many American men were drafted into military service during World War I. Drafts and the need for war supplies led to labor shortages, which gave women the opportunity to apply for jobs in places they would have been denied employment before the war, such as munitions factories. More than 10,000 women worked at the Old Hickory Powder Plant, a large smokeless powder plant opened by DuPont Engineering Company in 1918 in Old Hickory, Tenn. near Nashville. The powder produced at the plant could be used for firearms and artillery. Though plant construction was not completed by the time the Armistice was signed, five of the six powder units were operational and produced 501,000 pounds of powder a day.</dc:description>
