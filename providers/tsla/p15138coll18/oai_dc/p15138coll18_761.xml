<dc:description>In the 1920s, American fashion underwent drastic changes. For women in particular, clothing became less conservative with hemlines progressively heightening to just below the knee, close fitting hats and bobbed hair, bare arms, straight and loose waistlines, and heavy makeup. In particular, "the flappers," or "new breed" of women, were known for wearing these fashions, and were considered brash women who smoked, drank, drove automobiles, and flouted social and sexual norms.</dc:description>
