<dc:title>V-Mail letter from Mary Washington Frazer to George Preston Frazer regarding Victory Gardens</dc:title>
<dc:description>Mary Frazer begins her letter describing the evidence of Spring's arrival and commenting on the weather her brother, Preston, might be having in Africa. She talks about people planting victory gardens, lamenting her lack of ability to plant one, and how difficult it can be to buy food with the coupons. She relays an update on a mutual friend's health through Jean Anderson's latest letter.</dc:description>
<dc:description>During World War II, Mary Washington Frazer was commissioned as an officer in the United States Marine Corps Women's Reserve. After completing her training courses, she was assigned positions at Quantico Marine Base in Virginia as well as Camp Lejeune in New River, North Carolina. After the war ended, Frazer remained in service for almost a year before being discharged. Because many of the resources needed for the war industry were in limited supply, many products were rationed during World War II, including gasoline. Civilians were given ration books that contain a small number of coupons for a limited amount of rationed products. In order to supplement their coupons, civilians were encouraged to grow their own vegetables in small "Victory" gardens. George Preston Frazer was Mary Washington Frazer's older brother. Preston was drafted into the Army in 1941 and served in the 2nd Armored Division's Headquarters. He served with the 2nd Armored Division in the European theater, including North Africa, Siciliy, France and Germany. The siblings maintained a friendship with Jean Anderson, a Red Cross worker who served in Europe during the war and relayed news from her family to the Frazers.</dc:description>
