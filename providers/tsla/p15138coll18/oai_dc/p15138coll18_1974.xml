<dc:title>Letter to Governor Tom C. Rye from F. A. McKenzie, President of Fisk University</dc:title>
<dc:description>Letter dated April 17, 1917 to Governor Tom C. Rye from Fayette Avery McKenzie, President of Fisk University and copy of telegram sent to President Woodrow Wilson also from McKenzie. These documents describe the willingness of the African American students at Fisk University to participate in the war effort. McKenzie also suggests organizing a network of African American schools in Tennessee to create programs for military training and volunteer service in organizations such as the Red Cross.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Selective Service Act of 1917 called for the compulsory registration and enlistment of American men regardless of race. While some African Americans were hesitant to support the United States' involvement in the war, many hoped that participation might lead to securing equal rights for the black population. Over 370,000 African American men were inducted into the army. The military remained segregated and most black soldiers were assigned to service units that performed manual labor, though the army did create two combat divisions for African American troops. Black college students were instrumental in getting an officer's training camp for black soldiers established in Des Moines, Iowa. Black women joined in the war effort as well by leading liberty loan drives, hosting rallies, and supporting black servicemen through clubs such as the National Association of Colored Women (NACW), Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA), Red Cross, and women's auxiliaries for black soldier unit</dc:description>
