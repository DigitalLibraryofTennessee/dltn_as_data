<dc:title>Tennessee secession election returns from Greene County</dc:title>
<dc:description>Sherriff James Reaves of Greene County sent this notice to the Tennessee Secretary of State certifying the results of the June 8th, 1861 election to confirm Tennessee's declaration of independence. According to this document, Greene County residents voted overwhelmingly not to separate from the Union. 744 citizens voted for no separation, 2,691 citizens voted for separation. The numbers for and against representation reflect the interest in providing representation to the government of the Confederate States of America. </dc:description>
<dc:description>In January 1861, Governor Isham Harris convened a special session of the Tennessee General Assembly. There, he requested a popular referendum to decide whether to convene a special state convention to consider Tennessee's federal relations. Secessionists and Unionists argued their sides. Held on February 9th, Tennesseans rejected the proposal for a special state convention. By the spring of 1861, circumstances were changing. Governor Harris calls another special session of the Tennessee General Assembly, asking legislators to adopt a declaration of indpendence. On May 6, the legislators voted by large margin to declare Tennessee's independence, but stipulated that their decision be put to a public referendum to be held on June 8th. Tennesseans voted 69 to 31 percent to support independence and secede from the Union. </dc:description>
