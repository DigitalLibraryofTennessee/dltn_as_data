<dc:title>Letter from wife of Henry Benton Henegar to Ed Porter Thompson regarding Indian removal</dc:title>
<dc:description>This letter, dictated by H. B. Henegar and transcribed by his wife, is a response to a request from Ed Porter Thompson for more information regarding the removal of the Cherokee Indians in 1838 and 1839. Henegar, who was employed by John Ross during the Removal period, starts his reply to Thompson by describing the place in Bradley County, Tennessee, where the Cherokees he accompanied were collected by the United States troops under the orders of General Winfield Scott. He explains the division of the Cherokee people into smaller groups, called detachments, and the process for each group's removal. According to his letter, Henegar states all the Cherokee detachments that were collected at this spot in Bradley County traveled the same route to the West through Tennessee and parts of Kentucky and Illinois before crossing the Mississippi River into Missouri. He describes his detachment getting stuck in the middle of the Mississippi River for three weeks when it froze. From there they traveled to the Indian Country in Arkansas where they dispersed and settled. He goes on to describe the events that happened after their relocation, including the creation of a new constitution and the conflict between the Ross and Ridge parties. He also gives an account of the assassinations of several Ridge party members who signed the Treaty of New Echota, though he believes Ross was not involved in organizing these attacks.</dc:description>
<dc:description>After the signing of the fraudulent Treaty of New Echota in 1835 by a minority group of Cherokees, led by Major Ridge, conflict over the tribe's removal and the treaty resulted in a fraction of the tribe into two parties, one supporting removal led by Ridge and the other against removal led by Chief John Ross. In 1838, the United States began forcibly removing nearly 17,000 Cherokees to lands west of the Mississippi River. Their long journey, coupled with little food or protection from disease and extreme elements, led to the death of thousands of Cherokees and became known as the Trail of Tears. Upon reaching the new Indian Territory the two groups of Cherokees faced more conflict over which party should maintain control over the Tribe. However, because the Cherokee Nation Council had established a law ordering the execution of anyone who negotiated the cession of Cherokee lands, most of the leaders of the Ridge party were assassinated shortly after the Tribe arrived in Arkansas. Henry Benton Henegar served as wagonmaster and secretary to Chief John Ross.</dc:description>
