<dc:title>Letter from Return Meigs to John Sevier</dc:title>
<dc:description>A letter from Indian agent Return Meigs to John Sevier regarding the intent to purchase about one million three hundred thousand acres of Cherokee lands. Meigs states that the Cherokees' claim to the land should be extinguished.</dc:description>
<dc:description>John Sevier served as a colonel during the Revolutionary War and led several Tennessee militias into battles against the Cherokee and Chickamagua. By 1798, he was governor of the newly-formed state of Tennessee. In the late 1700s, territorial clashes between white settlers and American Indians including the Cherokees and Chickasaws led to a hostile and often violent environment between the two groups. Several series of treaties between the United States government and tribal governments were signed in an attempt to establish boundary lines and prevent further violence.</dc:description>
