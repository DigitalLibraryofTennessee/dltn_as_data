<dc:title>Dedicated to the United States Marine Corps Women's Reserve songbook</dc:title>
<dc:description>This songbook contains lyrics to 34 songs sung by the Marine Corps and women's reserve branches of the Navy (WAVES), Coast Guard (SPARs) and Marines. The booklet has official songs like the Marines' Hymn and the Star Spangled Banner as well as short, playful songs.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Because of the volume of soldiers needed on the front lines during World War II, the United States government allowed women to fill non-combatant positions in the military in order to release as many men as possible for fighting. Every branch of the military incorporated women into their ranks in some fashion. The United States Marine Corps Women's Reserve (MCWR) were authorized in July, 1942, when the Navy created its women's reserve, Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES). However, the MCWR was not formed until February of 1943. At the end of WWII, most of the women who had enlisted were discharged and expected to return to traditional feminine roles. However, small numbers of women remained a part of each branch and were able to continue their military careers. The MCWR was made a permanent part of the U.S. Marine Corps in 1948 with the Armed Forces Integration Act.</dc:description>
