<dc:title>Letter from Gov. Hill McAlister to Senator K.D. McKellar regarding banking deposit refunds</dc:title>
<dc:description>Gov. McAlister writes to Senator McKellar outlining his support for a proposed congressional bill that would repay despositors in state, national, and private banks that lost money in the bank crashes.</dc:description>
<dc:description>After the stock market crash in 1929, many banks closed and depositors lost their savings. To remedy this and restore faith in the banking system, Congress and FDR passed several laws for banking reform. They also created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insures bank deposits if a bank closes. </dc:description>
