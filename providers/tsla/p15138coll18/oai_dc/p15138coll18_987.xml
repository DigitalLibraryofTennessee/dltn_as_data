<dc:title>Negro sit-ins resumed here</dc:title>
<dc:description>A newspaper article and photo from The Nashville Tennessean dated March 26, 1960, found on page one and page two, column two. The demonstrations end a three week truce between Negroes and merchants which had been agreed to in deference to the mayor's biracial committee. The article incudes quotes from John Sloan, owner of Cain-Sloan Department Store and activist, John Lewis, one of four students arrested during the protests. CBS television cameramen film a meeting of demonstrators at the First Baptist Church for an upcoming documentary film.</dc:description>
<dc:description>John Lewis was born on February 21, 1940 in Troy, Alabama. He graduated from both the American Baptist Theological Seminary and Fisk University. Lewis was an active participant and early student leader of the civil rights movement in Tennessee. In 1960, he became a founding member and later was named chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. He was one of the original Freedom Riders and was a prominent speaker at the March on Washington. Lewis was elected to Congress in 1986 and serves as a member of the United States House of Representatives from Georgia's 5th Congressional District.</dc:description>
