<dc:title>Folsom Points, McCall Collection, Tenn.  </dc:title>
<dc:description>A black-and-white photograph of seven Native American spear points arranged on a dark surface.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The spear points shown were made by PaleoIndians prior to about 8000 BCE.  While the note on the back of the photograph identifies these artifacts as belonging to the prehistoric Folsom culture, state prehistoric archaeologist Aaron Deter-Wolf asserts that they are actually from the earlier Clovis and Cumberland periods.  Numerous artifacts from these periods have been found in Tennessee, providing evidence that PaleoIndians were present in our area more than 10000 years ago.  </dc:description>
