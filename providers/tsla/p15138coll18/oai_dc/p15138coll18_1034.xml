<dc:title>Letter from L.Kirby Matherne to Governor Buford Ellington</dc:title>
<dc:description>This letter, written by attorney L.Kirby Matherne, expresses appreciation to Ellington for his work in the Supreme Court case regarding voting rights in Haywood and Fayette Counties. In describing the Federal Government s involvement with Fayette and Haywood Counties, Matherne writes:  [a]pparently the Government did not want to dismiss the suit in exchange for the food program deal. They chose instead to accept a proposed compromise which the lawyers had worked out whereby the Government took an injunction against fifty of the defendants here in Haywood County and dismissed the suit against twenty-three defendants[ .]we realize that the people with whom you were dealing have a tendency to say one thing and do another. </dc:description>
<dc:description>During the 1950s, the African American citizens of Fayette and Haywood Counties struggled for full voting rights. Although African Americans had the legal right to vote, white citizens of these counties imposed roadblocks to keep blacks from voting. In response to this, African American leaders formed the Fayette County Civic and Welfare League and the Haywood County Civic and Welfare League. In June and July of 1959, these leagues held voter registration drives for African Americans so they could vote in the August Democratic primary. However, African Americans were blocked by whites from voting in the primary. This prompted the Leagues to file a legal suit against the local Democratic Party under the Civil Rights Act of 1957. As a way to penalize African American voters, white citizens of these counties compiled a list of all the registered African American voters and circulated it amongst white merchants, doctors, and other white business people. In response, many African Americans were refused goods, services, and insurance, and some lost employment and credit. Also, in the winter of 1960, many African American tenant farmers were evicted from the land they were living on and forced to move elsewhere. In response to this, several African American property owners allowed ""Tent Cities"" to be erected on their land. ""Tent Cities"" were where several African Americans established tent homes. The residents were sent food and other supplies from supporters from across the country while facing opposition and violence from groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and the White Citizens Council. By 1962, the situation in Fayette and Haywood Counties had been brought to the attention of the United States Government, and the Justice Department ruled that interfering with voting rights, including land discrimination based on voting, was illegal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </dc:description>
