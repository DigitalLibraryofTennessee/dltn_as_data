<dc:title>The Hun-his Mark</dc:title>
<dc:description>This poster from World War I shows a bloody handprint, presumably from a German soldier. The text of the poster reads, "The Hun-his Mark. Blot it out with Liberty Bonds."</dc:description>
<dc:description>President Woodrow Wilson established the Committee on Public Information to create and disseminate information that would influence public opinion on the United States' participation in World War I. The committee, which operated from 1917-1919, was also known as the Creel Committee after its director George Creel. The Division of Pictorial Publicity created one of the most popular formats for these messages, the propaganda poster. Liberty loans, or liberty bonds, were war bonds created by U.S. Secretary of the Treasury William Gibbs McAdoo. They were sold in the United States to boost patriotism and support the Allied powers during World War I. Bonds were sold to the public in different amounts as loans, which the U.S. government agreed to repay in full with interest in a specified number of years. There were four Liberty Loan Bond issues and one post-war Victory Bond issue. Altogether, these bonds raised about 21 billion dollars.</dc:description>
