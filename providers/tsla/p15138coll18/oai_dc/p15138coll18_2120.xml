<dc:title>Chief John Ross' house located in Rossville, Georgia</dc:title>
<dc:description>This is a picture of a two-story log structure with a stone chimney and covered porch. The structure is located at the foot of a tree-covered hill with two trees in front. All of the trees are barren. In the foreground of the picture there is a wooden fence. There is a sign on the front porch that reads, "Tom Thumb Miniature Gold Course." In the top lefthand corner there is an insert that contains a sketch of Cherokee Chief John Ross. The stamp in the bottom right hand corner reads, "Cline Studios, Chattanooga." The caption of the whole image reads, "The John Ross House, Rossville, Georgia."</dc:description>
<dc:description>John Ross was the first and only elected Cherokee chief. He served in this capacity from 1828 to 1866 and is most known for his opposition to the removal of the Native Americans to lands west of the Mississippi River. When the Cherokee tribe was forced to remove during 1838-1839, John Ross sold his property and traveled to Arkansas with his people and continued to serve as their chief in this new territory.</dc:description>
