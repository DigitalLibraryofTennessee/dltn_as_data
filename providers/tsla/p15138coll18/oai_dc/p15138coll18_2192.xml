<dc:description>This map offers a colorful view of the different dams and reservoirs that were created on the river to control the river's navigation and help with flood control.

<dc:description>During the 1930s, America was experiencing an economic downturn known as the Great Depression. As a way to help Americans recover, President Franklin D. Roosevelt introduced his "New Deal" programs. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was founded to help the hard-hit Tennessee Valley, where it was tasked with improving the quality of life in the region. One of the ways TVA improved the area was creating dams and reservoirs on the Tennessee River to control the river's navigation and help with flood control.</dc:description>
