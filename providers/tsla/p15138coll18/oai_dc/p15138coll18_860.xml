<dc:title>An income tax</dc:title>
<dc:description>Clipping from the Daily American discussing the possibility of the U.S. Congress imposing a graduated income tax. The writer supports the measure as common sense, quoting the New York Tribune in refuting the labeling of the tax's supporters as "socialists and property haters."</dc:description>
<dc:description>Populists were ardent supporters of a graduated income tax, including it in their platform of 1892. Until this point, federal taxation had been focused on imports, exports, and sales. To impose an income tax would help ensure the wealthier class shouldered a heftier portion of the tax burden.</dc:description>
