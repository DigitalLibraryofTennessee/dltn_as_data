<dc:title>Letter from Governor Joseph McMinn to Secretary of State Daniel Graham regarding McMinn's speeches to the Cherokees on cession of lands</dc:title>
<dc:description>In this letter, Tennessee Governor Joseph McMinn writes to Secretary of State Daniel Graham to assure him that he is doing all he can to encourage the Cherokee people to surrender their lands to the United States and remove west of the Mississippi River. He describes the previous day's speeches to the Cherokees and their reactions, and confesses he will be glad when his work is finished in that place so he can have a more relaxing life. He states that nothing in that place would be accomplished if he was not there. The letter is handwritten and has several stamped seals on the pages.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the American government continually pressed the Cherokee Nation to cede their ancestral lands and remove to lands west of the Mississippi River. Though this letter is dated before what is typically held as the Removal Period, it is a good example of how many years the United States had been pressuring the Native Americans to give up their ancestral lands.</dc:description>
