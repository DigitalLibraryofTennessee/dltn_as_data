<dc:title>Letter from Reverend J.A. Jones to Governor Thomas C. Rye</dc:title>
<dc:description>This two page letter is from Reverend J.A. Jones, a former slave who was once owned by a prominent white Tennessee family. Jones, also an elder of a Nashville African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church, discussed the lynching of a black man that occurred in Lexington, Tennessee. Not only did Jones reflect on this lynching, he also compared the lynching in Lexington to a lynching that occurred in Estill Springs, Tennessee. Jones particularly looked at the Estill Springs event and explained how a white posse, led by a former sheriff, turned the black man over to the "hands of an 'orderly,' infuriated crowd of respectable citizens, who proceeded to hang him." Written during World War I, Jones mentioned the African American soldiers fighting overseas and his desire to make the home front a safe place for them and a place that is worthy of them defending with their lives. At the end of his letter, Jones appealed to Governor Rye to bring those responsible for the lynching to justice.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Jim Crow Laws were policies and regulations regarding segregation of African Americans in the United States from the Reconstruction Era through the 1960s. Jim Crow laws dictated segregation in all aspects of life, including transportation, housing, entertainment, and access to things such as water fountains and entryways to buildings. Jim Crow was mainly prevalent in the Southern states, but was also found in some Northern states. The landmark Supreme Court case of Plessy v. Ferguson in 1892 resulted in the legal mandate of "separate but equal," a main tenant of Jim Crow. Although Jim Crow laws were very restrictive, African Americans were further persecuted by groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and other hate groups. Often, African Americans were lynched as a form of "justice" for alleged crimes. Lynchings were violent occurrences that often became town spectacles that citizens would attend much like a performance.</dc:description>
