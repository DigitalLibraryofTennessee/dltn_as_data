He attended Cumberland Law School and Vanderbilt University.He served as a state senator before being elected mayor of Nashville in 1951, a position he held until 1963. Mayor West died in 1974. Diane Nash was born May 15, 1938 in Chicago, Illinois. She attended Howard University in Washington, D.C. and later transferred to Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee. A vocal leader of civil rights and anti-war movements, particularly from 1959 to 1967, she was a strong supporter of the non-violent protest philosophy. She was instrumental in organizing the Freedom Rides and the 1963 March on Washington. Nash returned to Chicago in 1965 where, as an educator and lecturer, she continues to be a passionate and prominent voice for political and social change. The author of this article, David Halberstam, would go on to become a Pulitizer prize winning journalist and historian. </dc:description>
