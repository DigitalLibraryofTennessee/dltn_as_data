<dc:title>Letter from John Sevier to Andrew Jackson regarding a challenge to duel</dc:title>
<dc:description>Andrew Jackson and John Sevier were bitter enemies. In 1803, John Sevier writes this letter to Andrew Jackson in response to Jackson's challenge to a duel. Sever writes "I have heard after all your gasconading conduct that you are preparing to leave town within a day or two, you have not named a place out of the limits of this State when you and myself can have a personal interview." Dueling is illegal in Tennessee at the time so Sevier is suggesting a location outside the state.  </dc:description>
