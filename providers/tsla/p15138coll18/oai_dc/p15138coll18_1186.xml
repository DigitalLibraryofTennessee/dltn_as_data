<dc:title>Carmene Jordan in Army uniform</dc:title>

<dc:description>Because of the volume of soldiers needed on the front lines during World War II, the United States government allowed women to fill non-combatant positions in the military in order to release as many men as possible for fighting. Every branch of the military incorporated women into their ranks in some fashion. In 1996, in an effort to expand its holdings about World War II, the Tennessee State Library and Archives sent surveys to WWII veterans from or currently living in Tennessee. Over 7000 veterans, or family members of veterans, returned completed questionnaries, often submitting additional supplemental materials, such as photographs, with their surveys. </dc:description>
