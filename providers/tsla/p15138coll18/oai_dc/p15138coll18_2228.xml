<dc:description>A promotional booklet for the United States Marine Corps Women's Reserve. This illustrated booklet describes the heritage of the Marine Corps and the need for women to fill the roles men are leaving open by going to the frontlines. It lists the benefits a Woman Reservist would get and what qualifications are needed to enlist. It describes the pay, rank, enlistment and training processes. At the end, there is a frequently asked questions section. Illustrations include recruiting poster images, drawings to create visuals for the information given, portraits of high-ranking officers of the Marine Corps and the Women's Reserve.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Because of the volume of soldiers needed on the front lines during World War II, the United States government allowed women to fill non-combatant positions in the military in order to release as many men as possible for fighting. Every branch of the military incorporated women into their ranks in some fashion. The United States Marine Corps Women's Reserve (MCWR) were authorized in July, 1942, when the Navy created its women's reserve, Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES). However, the MCWR was not formed until February of 1943. At the end of WWII, most of the women who had enlisted were discharged and expected to return to traditional feminine roles. However, small numbers of women remained a part of each branch and were able to continue their military careers. The MCWR was made a permanent part of the U.S. Marine Corps in 1948 with the Armed Forces Integration Act.</dc:description>
