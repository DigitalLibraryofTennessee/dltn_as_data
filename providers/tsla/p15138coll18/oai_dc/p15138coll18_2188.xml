<dc:title>Douglas Dam on the French Broad River</dc:title>
<dc:description>This photograph shows a view of Douglas Dam that was created as part of the Tennessee Valley Authority project in the 1930s and 1940s.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Douglas Dam is located at the northeast border of Sevier County on the French Broad River. Douglas Dam is 202 feet high and 1,705 feet wide. In order to make the reservoir, Tennesee Valley Authority (TVA) personnel removed 525 families in Sevier, Jefferson, Cocke, and Hamblen Counties. As a result, many rural towns, schools, businesses and homes were destroyed for the construction of the dam and lake. In addition, TVA personnel relocated cemeteries. </dc:description>
