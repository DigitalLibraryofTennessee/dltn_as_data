<dc:title>Letter from Val Peterson of the Federal Civil Defense Administration to Frank G. Clement regarding preparation for an atomic attack</dc:title>
<dc:description>Val Peterson writes to Governor Frank Clement and includes the first official report on "Operation Doorstep", an atomic test held in March 1953, and a manual, "Home Shelters for Family Protection in an Atomic Attack." According to Peterson, "these two publications provide new pictorial and scientific evidence that it is possible for people to live through an atomic attack, if they are prepared." </dc:description>
<dc:description>"Operation Doorstep" was a nuclear test that evaluated the blast and thermal effects on mannequins, automobiles, and wooden frame houses. Conducted by the Federal Civil Defense Administration in Nevada, the study was intended to show the public the impact of nuclear weapons on major cities. </dc:description>
