<dc:title>"Child Labor"</dc:title>
<dc:description>Anne Porterfield Rankin wrote a manuscript in which she analyzes the problem of child labor and its causes.</dc:description>
<dc:description>In her manuscript on the problem of child labor, Rankin explores the root of the problem, in which she identifies not only employers but also the parents of working children. She explores the religious and moral backlash of needlessly putting helpless children to work. She also talks about education and economic status. In the addition to the topic of child labor, the manuscript acts as an example of the racist, sexist, and classist ideas prevalent in the early twentieth century. Anne Porterfield Rankin (1869-1942) was a journalist and writer. In 1899 she became the literary editor of the newspaper the Nashville American. In 1908 she became editor of the Sourthern Woman's Magazine. In 1927 she became editorial writer for the Knoxville Journal and began the "Rain Pool" column. She also reviewed books for several publications, and acted as a leader, teacher, and did community service work with the Red Cross. Critics in the South proclaimed her editorials and columns as outstanding.</dc:description>
