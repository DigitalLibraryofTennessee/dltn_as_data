<dc:title>Labor Day Proclamation</dc:title>
<dc:description>Governor's proclamation of Labor Day, Monday, September 2, 1901 in which he recognizes the dignity of labor, and realizes that upon it rests the prosperity of the state and well-being of the people.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Labor Day became an offical federal holiday in 1894, just days after President Cleveland ended the Pullman Strike with army troops. In the late 19th century, as trade union and labor movements grew, unionists proposed that a day be set adside to celebrate labor. Labor Day honors the American labor movement and the contributions that workers have made to the country's strength and prosperity.</dc:description>
