<dc:title>Letter to Governor Thomas C. Rye</dc:title>
<dc:description>This short letter, postcard size with writing on both the front and back side, is from a former mob leader whose name is not given. While not including explicit racial words, the language of this note definitely shows the racism that was strong among mob members. The author of this letter is urging Governor Rye to "not interfere with the electrocution of the black animals for such crimes as they have been doing lately." The author tells Rye that if justice is given by the government to black criminals (aka execution), then mob violence will end. The back of this note states, "womanhood is our glory and what keeps us all from being barbarians so let us all protect it and give thanks that we have it in this world to protect." This statement demonstrates the myth that permeated the time period that lynching black men was a way to protect white females.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Jim Crow Laws were policies and regulations regarding segregation of African Americans in the United States from the Reconstruction Era through the 1960s. Jim Crow laws dictated segregation in all aspects of life, including transportation, housing, entertainment, and access to things such as water fountains and entryways to buildings. Jim Crow was mainly prevalent in the Southern states, but was also found in some Northern states. The landmark Supreme Court case of Plessy v. Ferguson in 1892 resulted in the legal mandate of "separate but equal," a main tenant of Jim Crow. Although Jim Crow laws were very restrictive, African Americans were further persecuted by groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and other hate groups. Often, African Americans were lynched as a form of "justice" for alleged crimes. Lynchings were violent occurrences that often became town spectacles that citizens would attend much like a performance.</dc:description>
