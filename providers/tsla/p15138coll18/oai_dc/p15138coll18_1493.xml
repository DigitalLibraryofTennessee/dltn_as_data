<dc:title>Ratification ticket</dc:title>
<dc:description>Horace H. Harrison used this ticket to vote for the abolition of slavery on February 22, 1865. A handwritten note on the back reads: ""Copy of a ticket I voted on the 22nd of Febry 1865 to ratify the amendment to the State Constitution abolishing slavery in the State of Tennessee. Horace H. Harrison.""</dc:description>
<dc:description>In January 1864, Andrew Johnson calls for Tennessee to hold a constitutional convention to enact a reconstruction program for the state. He required voters to be willing to swear their support for an end to slavery. The convention was not held until a year later, after Johnson becomes Lincoln's vice-president. On February 22, 1865, the individuals participating in that convention voted to abolish slavery in the state. On April 5, 1865, Tennessee ratified the 13th Amendment which abolished slavery in the United States. Tennessee was the first of the seceded slave states to abolish slavery before the final ratification of the 13th amendment which abolished slavery in all states. On July 24, 1866, Tennessee became the first state readmitted into the Union. Horace Harrison was a district attorney at the time of this vote. Later, he served Tennessee as a judge for Tennessee's Supreme Court (1867-1878) and as a member of the United States House of Representatives for the 5th district (1873-1875).</dc:description>
