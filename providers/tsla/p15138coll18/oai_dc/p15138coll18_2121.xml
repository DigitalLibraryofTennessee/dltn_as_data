<dc:title>Daguerreotype portrait of Chief John Ross</dc:title>
<dc:description>This is a print made in 1948 of a daguerrotype made in the 19th century that shows the bust of John Ross.

<dc:description>John Ross was the first and only elected Cherokee chief. He served in this capacity from 1828 to 1866 and is most known for his opposition to the removal of the Native Americans to lands west of the Mississippi River. When the Cherokee tribe was forced to remove during 1838-1839, John Ross traveled to Arkansas with his people and continued to serve as their chief in this new territory.</dc:description>
