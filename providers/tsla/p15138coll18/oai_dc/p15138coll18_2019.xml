<dc:title>"'God Bless You All---I am Innocent': Ed Johnson's Last Words Before Being Shot to Death By a Mob Like a Dog"</dc:title>
<dc:description>This headline article actually makes up most of the entire front page of this newspaper issue, with a small portion of it continuing on the second page. This item discusses various aspects of a lynching event, including describing the lynch mob's acquisition of Ed Johnson, the involvement of the sheriff, and the lynching itself. This article explains lynching without using overly graphic language while still displaying lynching as a violent act.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Jim Crow Laws were policies and regulations regarding segregation of African Americans in the United States from the Reconstruction Era through the 1960s. Jim Crow laws dictated segregation in all aspects of life, including transportation, housing, entertainment, and access to things such as water fountains and entryways to buildings. Jim Crow was mainly prevalent in the Southern states, but was also found in some Northern states. The landmark Supreme Court case of Plessy v. Ferguson in 1892 resulted in the legal mandate of "separate but equal," a main tenant of Jim Crow. Although Jim Crow laws were very restrictive, African Americans were further persecuted by groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and other hate groups. Often, African Americans were lynched as a form of "justice" for alleged crimes. Lynchings were violent occurrences that often became town spectacles that citizens would attend much like a performance.</dc:description>
