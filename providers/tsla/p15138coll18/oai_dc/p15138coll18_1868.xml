<dc:title>Letter from Governor Archibald Roane to citizens dwelling on Indian Territory</dc:title>
<dc:description>In this letter, Governor Archibald Roane writes to the citizens living in Indian territory explaining that the president intended to honor the land treaties made with the Indians. Roane tells the settlers that if they do not heed his warning and move off the land, they will be forcibly removed either by the courts or by federal troops. Roane says he has no power over this command and suggests that the settlers should follow his warning. He further tells the settlers not to contact him again if they choose not to leave the Indian territory.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Archibald Roane served as Attorney General of the Southwest Territory in the 1790s. He then served as the third governor of Tennessee. In the late 1700s, territorial clashes between white settlers and American Indians including the Cherokees and Chickasaws led to a hostile and often violent environment between the two groups. Several series of treaties between the United States government and tribal governments were signed in an attempt to establish boundary lines and prevent further violence.</dc:description>
