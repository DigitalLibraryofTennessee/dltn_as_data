<dc:title>1893 House Bill 6</dc:title>
<dc:description>This is the first child labor bill, setting the minimum age limit of child workers at 12.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Tennessee, which in 1890 had nearly seventy thousand working children between the ages of 10-15, was one of the first states in the country to pass legislation putting restrictions on the use of child labor. In 1893, Governor Peter Turney signed into law House Bill 6, which made it illegal to employ children under the age of twelve in "work-shops, mines, mills, or factories in this State." Before this child labor bill, there was no age minimum for child workers. Children entered the workforce at very young ages, as soon as they were able to contribute to a family's income.</dc:description>
