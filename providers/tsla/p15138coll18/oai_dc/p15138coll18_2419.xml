<dc:title>Circular to the Governors of the Sixteen Southern States</dc:title>
<dc:description>Written by Wilmington, North Carolina resident W.B. Davis, this circular is addressed to Governor William Trousdale of Tennessee. It is a copy of a circular sent to the sixteen southern governors and includes a letter addressed to Governor Burnett of California, also from W.B. Davis. Davis' intent in this letter and circular is to encourage the governors to engage in mutual correspondence on the issue of slavery. He writes, "That deep "Yankee trick" of Abolition and "free-soil" conspiracy and corruption and imposition of that Wilmot proviso on California, has given the North all she wants at present."
