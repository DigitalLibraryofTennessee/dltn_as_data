<dc:title>1917 House Bill 997</dc:title>
<dc:description>This bill said that children between 14 and 16 years of age could be employed, during or after the school term, provided they secure from the County Superintendent of Schools, or his/her representative, a working certificate. It stipulated that such children could only be employed 8 hours in any one day, 6 days a week, and not before 6:00am or after 7:00pm of any day. Lastly, it mandated a time record be kept by the employer showing the hours that such children were actually employed, and the record had to be open to inspection by properly authorized officials at any time.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This labor legislation expanded upon the earlier 1911 Public Act 57, which forbade the employment of children under fourteen years of age and allowed the employment of children ages 14 to 16 under certain conditions. Those conditions were modified and extended in the 1917 Act to reflect compulsory school attendance laws for children. In addition to requiring a county school superintendent to sign a work certificate, it also required employees to keep strict time sheets that were subject to inspection by officials. The combination of strict work hours and need for work certificates helped ebb the number of child workers and encouraged education.</dc:description>
