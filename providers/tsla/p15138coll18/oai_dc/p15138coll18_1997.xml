<dc:description>This segregation law, known as the first Jim Crow law, permitted discrimination in public places. This law covered all public places such as trains, hotels, and theaters.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Jim Crow Laws were policies and regulations regarding segregation of African Americans in the United States from the Reconstruction Era through the 1960s. Jim Crow laws dictated segregation in all aspects of life, including transportation, housing, entertainment, and access to things such as water fountains and entryways to buildings. Jim Crow was mainly prevalent in the Southern states, but was also found in some Northern states. The landmark Supreme Court case of Plessy v. Ferguson in 1892 resulted in the legal mandate of "separate but equal," a main tenant of Jim Crow. Although Jim Crow laws were very restrictive, African Americans were further persecuted by groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and other hate groups. Often, African Americans were lynched as a form of "justice" for alleged crimes. Lynchings were violent occurrences that often became town spectacles that citizens would attend much like a performance.</dc:description>
