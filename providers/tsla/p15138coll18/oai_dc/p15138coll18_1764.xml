<dc:title>Letter to Creek chief Alexander McGillivray from James Robertson</dc:title>
<dc:description>In this letter to Creek chief Alexander McGillivray, James Robertson discusses the death of Anthony Bledsoe and asks for more information regarding the reports of war between the white settlers at Holston and the Cherokees. Robertson asks for McGillivray's help in keeping the peace between the two nations.</dc:description>
<dc:description>In the late 18th century, there was an increase in white settlers moving westward and settling on Indian territory in present-day Tennessee. The increase in white settlements on Indian territory intensified the already-hostile relations between the Indians and the settlers. Despite several treaties, white settlers continued to move westward, encroaching upon Indian territory. Poltical leaders from both the United States and the Indian tribes sought peace and compromise.</dc:description>
