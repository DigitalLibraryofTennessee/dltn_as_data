<dc:description>Many talented scientists in the United States were relocated from their homes and universities to work on the Manhattan Project at Oak Ridge. These scientists often brought their families with them or married and began families on the military reservation. The accommodations for these high-ranking members of this community were called "cemestos" due to the composition of their building material, cement and asbestos. Single workers on the project often lived in sex segregated dormitories. Others lived in temporary trailers when space ran out in cemestos and dormitories. African American workers lived in significantly worse conditions, segregated by race and sex, even for married couples. The "huntment" structures that they were housed in had no heat or air conditioning and were called hovels by newspapers of the period.</dc:description>
