<dc:title>An airplane spraying chemicals</dc:title>
<dc:description>This photograph shows an airplane spraying chemicals in the West Sandy area near Paris, Tennessee. The spraying was part of the TVA malaria control project.</dc:description>
<dc:description>When the Tennessee Valley Authority was incorporated in 1933, malaria affected a third of the population in the region. Death records kept by the Tennessee Valley counties indicated that mosquito borne diseases like malaria and yellow fever took an enormous toll in human life before TVA launched its mosquito-control programs. TVA's response to fighting these diseases was controlling water levels and applying insecticides to help reduce the mosquito breeding sites.</dc:description>
