<dc:title>Interview of George Parker describing the ethical debate on use of the atomic bomb</dc:title>
<dc:description>Interview of George Parker, nuclear chemist on Manhattan Project in Oak Ridge conducted by Ann Toplovich of the Tennessee Historical Society at his home at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. In this interview, Parker describes the ethical debate scientists and government officials engaged in over use of the atomic bomb, which was sparked by the circulation of The Szilard Petition.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Szilard Petition (dated July 17, 1945) was signed by Leo Szilard and 69 other scientists in Chicago and Oak Ridge. This petition asked President Truman to demonstrate the power of the bomb to the Japanese before detonation. At Oak Ridge, this document prompted discussion among Clinton Engineer Works scientists about the use of nuclear weapons in warfare. Scientists, including Parker, wrote letters to the president detailing their positions for or against using atomic weapons to end World War II.</dc:description>
