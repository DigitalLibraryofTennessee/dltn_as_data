<dc:title>Executive Order Authorizing Purchase of Land for Emergency Conservation Work</dc:title>
<dc:description>This executive order from FDR authorized the purchase of land for several national parks, including the Great Smoky Mountains, Shenandoah, and Mammoth Cave, to help relieve unemployment. </dc:description>
<dc:description>By issuing an exectutive order calling for land purchases for these national parks under the umbrella of emergency relief, Roosevelt forced the issue of funding to become a reality. The creation of more national parks gave projects to relief organizations like the Civilian Conservation Corps, which built infrastructure to make the parks publically accessable.</dc:description>
