<dc:description>The original walls of Fort Loudon were destroyed after its surrender to the Cherokee in 1760.  The fort was reconstructed in the mid-1900s from the original plan by the immigrant Dutch military engineer William Gerard de Brahm.  (See 42220.)  The walls are in the form of a log palisade, which consists of tree trunks sharpened at the top and driven several feet into the ground side-by-side to form the protective enclosure.  This method of construction was commonly used for forts constructed in the interior of North America before 1900, including the walled Mississippian towns encountered by the Spanish conquistadores in the 1540s.   </dc:description>
