<dc:title>Talk from Hanging Maw</dc:title>
<dc:description>A letter or "talk" from Cherokee leader, Hanging Maw, to Colonel Joseph Martin. Hanging Maw asks Martin for more information regarding Congress and the removal of Americans for Indian lands in East Tennessee.</dc:description>
<dc:description>"Joseph Martin was a Revolutionary War hero who lived on the border of the Virginia-Tennessee frontier. He married Betsy Ward, the daughter of Beloved Woman Nancy Ward and trader Bryant Ward. In 1777, he was appointed as an Indian agent where he was involved with the negotiations between American goverments and the Indian leaders. Hanging Maw was an Overhill Cherokee chief residing in East Tennessee. In the late 18th century, there was an increase in white settlers moving westward and settling on Indian territory in present-day Tennessee. The increase in white settlements on Indian territory intensified the already-hostile relations between the Indians and the settlers. Despite several treaties, white settlers continued to move westward, encroaching upon Indian territory. Poltical leaders from both the United States and the Indian tribes sought peace and compromise."</dc:description>
