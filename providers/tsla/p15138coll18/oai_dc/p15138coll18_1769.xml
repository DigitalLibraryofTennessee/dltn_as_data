<dc:title>Letter to M.H. Crowell</dc:title>
<dc:description>This letter discusses details about 1917 Public Act 77, particularly whether it is lawful that children be charged a fee to obtain their work certificates from the County Superintendent.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This labor legislation expanded upon the earlier 1911 Public Act 57, which forbade the employment of children under fourteen years of age and allowed the employment of children ages 14 to 16 under certain conditions. Those conditions were modified and extended in the 1917 Act to reflect compulsory school attendance laws for children. In addition to requiring a county school superintendent to sign a work certificate, it also required employees to keep strict time sheets that were subject to inspection by officials. The combination of strict work hours and need for work certificates helped ebb the number of child workers and encouraged education.</dc:description>
