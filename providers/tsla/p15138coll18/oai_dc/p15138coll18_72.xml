<dc:title>The Kitchen Cabinet</dc:title>
<dc:description>This political cartoon is an adaptation of the nursery rhyme "House that Jack Built" with the major players in the 1833 Bank War are represented as characters from the rhyme.</dc:description>
<dc:description>In September 1833, President Andrew Jackson made a now infamous decision to remove federal deposits from the Second Bank of the United States, a privately chartered institution. Jackson was afraid that the bank would eventually become too powerful, since the federal government gave the bank the right of not only controlling federal funds, but printing money as well. Even those who shared Jackson's concern about the growing monopoly of the bank feared that completely removing the funds, especially all at once, would create a panic and hurt the general public. They also believed Jackson was abusing his office.  William J. Duane, the Secretary of the Treasury, who was dismissed by Jackson, was one of these men. In 1834, the Senate censured Jackson for assuming powers not conferred by the Constitution. In 1837, as Jackson was ailing, the Senate expunged the censure.</dc:description>
