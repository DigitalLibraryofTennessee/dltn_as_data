<dc:description>Samuel Slater was born on June 9, 1768 in Derbyshire, England. While in England, he worked in a cotton mill and became very familiar with the mill machines. In 1789, Slater emigrated to the United States with dreams of building a textile industry. With the support of a Quaker merchant named Moses Brown, Slater built America's first water-powered cotton spinning mill in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. To drive the machinery, a water wheel was used to generate power to card and spin the cotton into thread. Over time, Slater began to employ families to live and work at the mill site. To house his workers, Slater and his brother built a mill village that included a mill, tenement house for his workers, and a company store.</dc:description>
