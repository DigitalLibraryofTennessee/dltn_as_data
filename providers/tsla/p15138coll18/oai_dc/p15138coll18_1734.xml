<dc:description>The cotton gin is a device for removing the seeds from cotton fiber. In 1794, Eli Whitney developed a cotton gin that cleaned short-staple cotton. With this device, fifty pounds of cleaned cotton could be produced in a day. As a result, cotton production grew each decade after 1800. By the 1850s, America was growing three-quarters of the world's supply of cotton, most of it shipped to England or New England where it was manufactured into cloth.</dc:description>
