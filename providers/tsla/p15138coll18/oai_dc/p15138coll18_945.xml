<dc:title>The point of view</dc:title>
<dc:description>A political cartoon that addresses the conflict conservationists had with commercial loggers who were against the development of the Great Smoky Mountains area into a national park.</dc:description>
<dc:description>For many years visitors to the Great Smoky Mountains were impressed by the natural beauty and argued for the region to be protected as a national park. However, timber companies with options on the last areas of uncut forest in East Tennessee disagreed and attempts to create a park in the Smokies stalled for some time. By the 1920s, Knoxville civic leaders and others began serious efforts to promote the creation of the national park. </dc:description>
