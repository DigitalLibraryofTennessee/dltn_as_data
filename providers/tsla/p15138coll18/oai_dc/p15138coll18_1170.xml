<dc:title>Interview with Maggie Duffy about her experience working with the Japanese Red Cross</dc:title>
<dc:description>Video interview of Maggie Duffy by Susan Gordon of the Tennessee Historical Society. In this clip, Duffy states her most interesting experience with the Red Cross was when she was working with the Japanese Red Cross during the reorganization after World War II. She explains that her job was to "help them understand the meaning of volunteering as we know it here in this country." She also helped them develop a word for volunteer because the Japanese language did not have a word for volunteer, which she says was established as 'hoshidan.'</dc:description>
<dc:description>In the 1990s, the Tennessee Historical Society recorded oral histories of Tennesseans who had served in the armed forces, volunteered in civilian services, or worked in war industries during World War II. Maggie Duffy worked with the Red Cross overseas for twelve years, in Australia, the Philippines, Korea and Japan, in both the military operations and the volunteer operations. </dc:description>
