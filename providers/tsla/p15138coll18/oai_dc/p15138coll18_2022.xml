<dc:title>Letter from D.L. Robinson to Governor Austin Peay</dc:title>
<dc:description>This one page letter, from a citizen of Spencer, Tennessee, begged Governor Peay for protection from lynching. D.L. Robinson stated that he has had "two crowds to come to my house at night in clansmen robes and threaten to burn my house and hang me" if he did not leave town by a certain date. Although this letter does not state why Robinson was being threatened, it gives a good example of the fear that the Ku Klux Kan often instilled in citizens.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Jim Crow Laws were policies and regulations regarding segregation of African Americans in the United States from the Reconstruction Era through the 1960s. Jim Crow laws dictated segregation in all aspects of life, including transportation, housing, entertainment, and access to things such as water fountains and entryways to buildings. Jim Crow was mainly prevalent in the Southern states, but was also found in some Northern states. The landmark Supreme Court case of Plessy v. Ferguson in 1892 resulted in the legal mandate of "separate but equal," a main tenant of Jim Crow. Although Jim Crow laws were very restrictive, African Americans were further persecuted by groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and other hate groups. Often, African Americans were lynched as a form of 
"justice" for alleged crimes. Lynchings were violent occurrences that often became town spectacles that citizens would attend much like a performance.</dc:description>
