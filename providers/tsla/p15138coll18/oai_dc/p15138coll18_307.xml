<dc:title>Classified ads for Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA), Carbide and Carbon Chemicals Corporation, and Tennessee Eastman Corporation</dc:title>
<dc:description>Series of classified ads that ran in multiple local East Tennessee publications for World War II production jobs.</dc:description>
<dc:description>ALCOA produced aluminum products used to construct aircrafts. Boys too young to join the military were encouraged to "do their bit" by taking jobs at the plant during school breaks. Carbide and Carbon Chemicals Corporation and Tennessee Eastman Corporation were a part of the Manhattan Project's Clinton Engineer Works, which produced materials to construct the atom bomb. The military chose the location of Oak Ridge in part for its remote location and cheap land, but the site's proximity to Knoxville was key, as the plants would require a large, local workforce to employ. The opening of these plants, combined with the draft of a large portion of the young men in the population, meant that many jobs both in Knoxville and Oak Ridge were open to and filled by local women.</dc:description>
