<dc:title>Just a Little Rocking-Chair and You</dc:title>
<dc:description>Political cartoon that appeared in the Nashville Tennessean newspaper on June 13, 1908. The cartoon features Governor Malcolm Patterson sitting in a rocking chair with a larger character sitting in his lab representing "liquor interests." The phrase, "Just a Little Rocking-Chair and You" was the title of a popular song released in February 1906. </dc:description>
<dc:description>As governor, Malcolm Rice Patterson oversaw creation of the State Highway Commission and led a movement for improvements in public education. With regard to prohibition, the governor was inconsistent with his opinion. During his campaign, he pledged to support the temperance movement but in 1909, he vetoed a bill prohibiting liquor sales within four miles of a school which angered temperance supporters.
