<dc:title>View of the Chickamauga Dam</dc:title>
<dc:description>This photograph shows a view of Chickamauga Dam that was created as part of the Tennessee Valley Authority project in the 1930s and 1940s.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Chickamauga Dam is located in Hamilton County, Tennessee. It was constructed as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal project known as the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). The Chickamauga Dam project was notable for having the highest percentage of African American workers of any TVA project in Tennessee. After it was completed, the Chickamauga Dam was 5,800 feet long, 129 feet high and held 506,400 cubic yards of concrete. In addition to the dam, a lake known as Chickamauga Lake was created with the project. The lake is almost fifty-nine miles in length and contains 35,400 acres and 800 miles of shoreline.</dc:description>
