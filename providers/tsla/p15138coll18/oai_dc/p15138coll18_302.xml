<dc:title>Letter to Guy Smith, editor of The Knoxville Journal, from Major General Leslie R. Groves</dc:title>
<dc:description>Reprint of letter dated August 8, 1945 from Major General Leslie R. Groves, Manhattan Engineer District, thanking Guy Smith, editor of the The Knoxville Journal, for censoring news about atomic research and the Manhattan Engineering Districts published August 12, 1945.</dc:description>
<dc:description>While most of the workers at Clinton Engineer Works did not know that they were playing a major role in the development of the atomic bomb, many in the newspaper profession had begun to piece together the significance of the top-secret military reservations in Tennessee, Washington, and New Mexico. When Germany surrendered in May of 1945, the government was concerned that reporters might expose the projects or demand more information on the atomic bomb, as there had been speculation and information leaks in the past. To combat the release of any sensitive information, the Office of Censorship mailed confidential letters in May to editors in Tennessee, Washington, and their surrounding states that asked the publications to keep these projects a secret until the end of the war.</dc:description>
