<dc:title>Nine negros return today at Clinton high; one moves to California</dc:title>
<dc:description>This article records the ongoing problems occurring from the integration of the high school three months after the event. This article mentions the closing of the school for a week in December, resulting from the continuing tension, and the status of the African American students after the school reopened. A particularly emotional quote comes from the father of one of the black students who decides to move his family to California due to the difficulties of integration in the South. This article also includes quotes from Clinton's mayor, Everette Lewallen, and Reverend Turner, famous for walking the African American students to the school on the first day of desegregation.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Clinton High School, located in Clinton, Tennessee in Anderson County, was the first school in the state to be integrated in 1956 following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education. There were twelve African-American students who enrolled in the school in the fall of 1956, and they became known as the "Clinton 12." During the integration in the fall of 1956, Clinton was the site of anti-integration riots and protests, including the involvement of notorious white supremacist John Kasper. After the violence escalated on September 1, the National Guard was called into Clinton to keep the peace and protect citizens.</dc:description>
