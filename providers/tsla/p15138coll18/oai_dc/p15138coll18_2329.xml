<dc:title>Members of the Women's Army Corps at a beer party in Germany</dc:title>
<dc:description>This black and white photograph was taken by George Preston Frazer while stationed in Germany. It shows three women serving in the Women's Army Corps beside a pool with some United States Army soldiers behind them. The women pictured are in recreational clothing. In the background of the picture, there is a house. On the back of the photograph, Frazer notes that the Headquarters Company "billeted in this house on Wannsee Lake. These are WACs at a beer party the men had."</dc:description>
<dc:description>Because of the volume of soldiers needed on the front lines during World War II, the United States government allowed women to fill non-combatant positions in the military in order to release as many men as possible for fighting. Every branch of the military incorporated women into their ranks in some fashion. The Women's Army Corps was the first women's reserve unit formed during World War II. It was originally created in 1942 as an auxiliary unit, known as the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps. However, when complications arose because of their civilian status in this auxiliary, the unit was changed into a women's reserve of the Army. The Women's Army Corps was the only women's reserve unit, aside from the nursing corps, to station women outside of the United States or U. S. controlled territories of Hawaii and Alaska. At the end of WWII, most of the women who had enlisted were discharged and expected to return to traditional feminine roles as civilians. However, small numbers of women remained a part of each branch and were able to continue their military careers. The Women's Army Corps became a permanent part of the U.S. Army in 1948 with the Armed Forces Integration Act.</dc:description>
