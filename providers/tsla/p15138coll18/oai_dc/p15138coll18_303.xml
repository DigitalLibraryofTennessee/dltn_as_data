<dc:title>Son of Eve</dc:title>
<dc:description>Political cartoon by unknown artist that compares humanity's use of the atomic bomb to the Biblical story of the fall of Adam and Eve.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Published two days after the bombing of Hiroshima, this cartoon is representative of the moral and ethical objections to nuclear warfare raised by many people around the world. It also echoes sentiments that humanity had reached a "point of no return" where important aspects of life would be forever altered after the use of nuclear weapons.</dc:description>
