<dc:description>Clinton High School, located in Clinton, Tennessee in Anderson County, was the first school in the state to be integrated in 1956 following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education. There were twelve African-American students who enrolled in the school in the fall of 1956, and they became known as the "Clinton 12." During the integration in the fall of 1956, Clinton was the site of anti-integration riots and protests, including the involvement of notorious white supremacist John Kasper. After the violence escalated on September 1, the National Guard was called into Clinton to keep the peace and protect citizens.</dc:description>
