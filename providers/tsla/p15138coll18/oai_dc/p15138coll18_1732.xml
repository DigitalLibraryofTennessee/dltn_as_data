<dc:description>A water mill is a mill that uses moving water as its power source. With the turning of the water wheel, mechanical processes such as grinding, rolling, or hammering items can be achieved. Some of the material goods water mills can be used for include flour, lumber, paper, textiles and many metal products.</dc:description>
