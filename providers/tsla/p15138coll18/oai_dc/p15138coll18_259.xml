<dc:title>Tennessee-Memphis under quarantine rule- scenes in the plague stricken city</dc:title>

<dc:description>Yellow Fever devastated the city of Memphis in the 1870s. In 1873, 2,000 were killed by the disease. When the disease returned in late July 1878, 25,000 residents fled the city. Between August and October of 1878, the disease killed more than 5,000 people. Towns along the railroads leading out of Memphis also experienced significant losses due to the epidemic. Yellow Fever caused fever, chills, hemorrhaging, severe pain, a yellowing of the skin, and vomit that was black in color. Several treatments were proposed for yellow fever by physicians and medical journals of the day. One recommendation was the use of &#65533;concussion&#65533; to kill the parasite causing yellow fever. Believing the disease was contagious, they thought that shooting cannons into the atmosphere would create a &#65533;concussion&#65533; that would kill the parasite causing yellow fever. Ultimately, yellow fever only ended in a community when a hard freeze killed the mosquitos transmitting the disease.</dc:description>
