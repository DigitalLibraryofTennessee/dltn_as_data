<dc:title>Follow the Pied Piper</dc:title>
<dc:description>This poster from World War I shows Uncle Sam playing a fife, leading children carrying gardening tools (a hoe, rake, trowel, and shovel) and a seed bag. There are fields of crops in the background. The text of the poster reads, "Follow the Pied Piper. Join the United States School Garden Army."</dc:description>
<dc:description>The United States School Garden Army (USSGA) was created in 1917 by the Bureau of Education and funded in part by the War Department. The program encouraged children, especially those in urban or suburban areas, to start gardens in their homes or at school. The United States government hoped that the food produced by these young gardeners would help America avoid a food crisis and foster patriotic attitudes in its youth. By the war's end in 1918, an estimated one and a half million children had joined the war garden effort.</dc:description>
