<dc:title>Dr. Seuss cartoon about tire rationing</dc:title>
<dc:description>This cartoon was featured in the July 3, 1942 issue of the Vultee Volunteer to remind employees to conserve their tires by using their cars as little as possible and make their tires last during the rationing. The drawing depicts a woman driving a car that, instead of tires, is being supported by her husband, a cat and a dog. The license plate says, "1944," and the husband's comment is, "You know, dear... sometimes I wish we'd gone easy on our tires back in 1942."</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Vultee Volunteer was a weekly newsletter published by the Nashville Division of Vultee Aircraft, Inc. for the employees of the plant. Within the issues, the newsletter contains cartoons, articles about the plant and the company, and people of interest. Each issue also commended someone for their efforts to suggest cost-saving changes in production. Vultee Aircraft often encouraged employees to carpool together to conserve rationed items like tires. </dc:description>
