<dc:title>Letter from Dr. G.B. Thornton, President of the Office of the Board of Health in Shelby County, to Dr. J.D. Plunket of the State Board of Health of Tennessee regarding yellow fever</dc:title>
<dc:description>This letter from Dr. G.B. Thornton to Dr. J.D. Plunket details the efforts of disinfecting and sanitary work underway in Memphis to defeat yellow fever. In closing, Thornton states "I do not propose to declare the disease epidemic until the deaths from Yellow Fever exceed those from all other good. There is no practical good to arrive for any official announcement of epidemic soon." This is in response to the 1879 epidemic which resulted in approximately 600 deaths from 2,000 cases. In 1878, more than 5,000 died from 17,000 cases of the disease.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Dr. G.B. Thornton was President of the Office of the Board of Health in Memphis-Shelby County, Tenn. Yellow Fever devastated the city of Memphis in the 1870s. In 1873, 2,000 were killed by the disease. When the disease returned in late July 1878, 25,000 residents fled the city. Between August and October of 1878, the disease killed more than 5,000 people. Towns along the railroads leading out of Memphis also experienced significant losses due to the epidemic. Yellow Fever caused fever, chills,hemorrhaging, severe pain, a yellowing of the skin, and vomit that was black in color.</dc:description>
