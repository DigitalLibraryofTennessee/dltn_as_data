<dc:title>Help wanted advertisements in the Nashville Tennessean</dc:title>
<dc:description>These help wanted ads list several job opportunities for women during World War II. One of the large ads on the page requests men or women for war work in 14 different war industry jobs. Another requests men or women to take an aircraft mechanic course and be assigned a job at an air base. There are other smaller ads on the page that request women for other jobs, like a soda dispenser or stenographer. </dc:description>
<dc:description>World War II was the catalyst that brought change in the gender roles held for women. Because of the labor shortage produced by men joining the armed forces during World War II, women were encouraged to takes jobs in nearly every industry. Traditional gender roles had limited the job descriptions of women, but the need for manpower during the war allowed women to extend the boundaries of the work they could perform outside the home.</dc:description>
