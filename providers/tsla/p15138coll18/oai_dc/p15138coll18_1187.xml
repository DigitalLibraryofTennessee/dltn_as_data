<dc:title>United States women chalk up proud year both at home and on battlefront</dc:title>
<dc:description>Newspaper article reviewing the events of 1943 and their impact on women in the United States. The article discusses important events for women and their careers, both in the armed forces and in industry. The article starts out by saying 1943 presented many challenges to women - in the armed forces recruitment was down, and in the workforce women found it difficult to work and take care of the home. However, it continues by saying that by mid-autumn women had proven their capability to face the added pressure. The article also references the debate of that time to include women in the draft. Also included is an illustrated collage of various women's positions.</dc:description>
<dc:description>World War II was the catalyst that brought change in the gender roles held for women. Because of the labor shortage produced by men joining the armed forces during World War II, women were encouraged to takes jobs in nearly every industry. Traditional gender roles had limited the job descriptions of women, but the need for manpower during the war allowed women to extend the boundaries of the work they could perform outside the home. In addition, because of the volume of soldiers needed on the front lines during World War II, the United States government allowed women to fill non-combatant positions in the military in order to release as many men as possible for fighting. Every branch of the military incorporated women into their ranks in some fashion.</dc:description>
