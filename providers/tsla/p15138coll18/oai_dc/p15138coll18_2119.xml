<dc:title>A visit to Col. Bates by George Frederick Mellen
</dc:title>
<dc:description>This newspaper article was written by George Frederick Mellen, a journalist for the Knoxville Sentinel in the early 1900s. The article describes Mellen's visit to Col. Thomas Leroy Bates' home in Tasso in Bradley County, Tennessee. At the time the article was written in 1914, Bates was the last living person connected with the Cherokee Removal. Bates was nineteen years old at the time of the removal in 1838, and helped his father furnish two wagon teams for the Cherokees' journey. Though Bates did not travel the entire journey to the Indian Territory, he did travel the first day with them to help break the horses on an unexperienced team. The article continues by relaying Bates' knowledge of the Cherokee people and their lives before removal, describing the people, the festivities, and religion, as well as the camps in which the Cherokee people were gathered by General Scott's force before beginning their journey. The article ends with Mellen's description of their attempt to visit Rattlesnake Springs, one of the collection sites for the Cherokees. It also contains a small, black and white portrait of Mellen.</dc:description>
