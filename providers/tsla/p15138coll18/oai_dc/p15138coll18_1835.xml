<dc:title>Cleveland's labor record</dc:title>
<dc:description>This is a political pamphlet discussing Grover Cleveland's opposition to labor reform, specifically during his time as Governor of New York and first term as president (1886 -1888). The pamphlet, most likely published just before the presidential election of 1888, is ultimately about the debate over convict labor, but it also talks about 10-15 other pieces of legislation, including child labor. It criminalizes Cleveland, the "Convict Labor Candidate," and ultimately presents Benjamin Harrison as the choice for the "honest workingmen." This is a good example of the federal climate with regard to labor reform.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Labor reform became a point of contestation in national politics. Later in Cleveland's seconrd term as U.S. President, he would send the army to break the Pullman Strike of 1894. The action was considered harsh and was protested against. In the wake of the strike, legislation was pushed through creating Labor Day. The leglislation, which Cleveland signed, arrived on his desk just six days after the Pullman strike broke.</dc:description>
