<dc:title>Letter from Thomas Williams to General John Coffee regarding suggestions for stipulations to offer the Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians in Mississippi</dc:title>
<dc:description>In this letter, Thomas Williams writes to General John Coffee to offer his suggestions about the land in Mississippi held by Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians. He begins by acknowledging Coffee, as a Commissioner, is fully aware of the negotiations being held for the cession of Indian claims to land within the boundaries of the state of Mississippi. He continues to give his opinion on what stipulations and proposed borders should be offered to the Nations, and gives alternate suggestions should the Tribes refuse the first suggestions.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the American government continually pressed the various tribes of Native Americans to cede their ancestral lands and remove to lands west of the Mississippi River.</dc:description>
