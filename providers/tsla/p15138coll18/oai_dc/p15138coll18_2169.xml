<dc:description>Although he lived considerably later than the long hunters of pre-Revolutionary times, David Crockett (1786-1836) is a good example of the long hunter way of life. Throughout his career, which included service in the War of 1812 and terms served in the Tennessee General Assembly and the U.S. House of Representatives, Crockett would disappear into the Tennessee wilderness on hunting trips lasting several months. Publications like the Crockett Almanac helped make him an example of the American frontiersman in his own lifetime and for many generations after. The image shown is the cover illustration of the 1842 Crockett Almanac, printed in Boston in that year. It presents the popular image of Crockett in frontier dress, holding a muzzle-loading long rifle and standing over a dead predator He is not, however, wearing the coonskin hat featured in later portrayals such as the Walt Disney television series of the 1950s.The Crockett Almanacs were examples of the "comic almanac," a type of humorous publication filled with tall tales, exaggerated descriptions of frontier "characters," and woodcut illustrations depicting dramatic or ridiculous situations. The first Crockett Almanac was published in Nashville in 1835. Between 1835 and 1856, some fifty-five editions were published in a variety of locations. Almost nothing is known about the writers, illustrators, or publishers of the first four editions, the "Nashville imprints" of 1835-1838. Subsequent editions were printed in northern cities such as Boston and Philadelphia. Scholars are reasonably certain that Crockett himself had nothing to do with these publications, and there is no record that he or his heirs ever received any payments from their sales.</dc:description>
