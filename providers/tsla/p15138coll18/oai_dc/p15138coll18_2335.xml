<dc:title>Copy of a letter addressed to "Trustee" from Andrew B. Wood, Superintendent of the Tennessee Anti-Saloon League
</dc:title>
<dc:description>Superintendent Andrew Wood states in this letter that he believes "...that the state of Tennessee, with its own laws upholding prohibition, can very well undertake to demonstrate the interest which it has in promoting law and order in its various communities." It is Superintendent Wood's opinion that there should be state officers who can cross county lines to apprehend "rum runners" and "automobile speeders." He references a law enforcement conference held by the Governor and Attorney Generals of the State to discuss the enforcement situation and the President of the United State's comments that "States assume more of their responsibility in the enforcement of the prohibition amendment."

<dc:description>The Prohibition movement was organized in the middle of the 19th century as part of a religious movement. As its popularity increased, several states banned consumption of alcohol. The 18th Amendment (passed 1917, ratified 1919) and the Volstead Act (passed 1920) both supplemented the movement, attempting to ban all alcohol in the United States. The 21st Amendment repealed the Prohibition laws in 1933. </dc:description>
