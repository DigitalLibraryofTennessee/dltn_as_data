<dc:description>"Many Saw Portents of Stax End, But Disagree on the Causes," The Commercial Appeal, Memphis, TN Second in a series of three articles. This second article focuses on Stax Records legal battle with their records distribution company, CBS, Inc., in the mid-1970s.</dc:description>

It had a racially integrated team of staff and artists, at that time unprecedented both in Memphis and the South.</dc:description>
