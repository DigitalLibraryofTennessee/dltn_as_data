<dc:title>Sears refrigerators</dc:title>
<dc:description>Shows advertisements for refrigerators people could purchase through the Sears, Roebuck and Company catalog.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Prior to the development of the mail order catalog, farmers typically had to purchase their goods at the local general store that often charged high prices and had a narrow selection. Richard Sears along with his business partner Alvah Curtis Roebuck, developed a mail order catalog that offered people a wide selection of products with clearly stated prices. The mail order catalog provided rural people the opportunity to obtain a vast amount of consumable products without having to travel to the city to purchase the items.</dc:description>
