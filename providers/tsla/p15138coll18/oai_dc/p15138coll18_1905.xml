<dc:title>Passport to Indian Territory</dc:title>
<dc:description>Passport written by John Sevier which allowed a group of settlers to go into the Indian territory in order to tend their grain. Each permitted settler signed the passport. A type of watermark is also present on the passport.</dc:description>
<dc:description>John Sevier served as a colonel during the Revolutionary War and led several Tennessee militias into battles against the Cherokee and Chickamauga. By 1798, he was governor of the newly-formed state of Tennessee. In the late 1700s, territorial clashes between white settlers and American Indians including the Cherokees and Chickasaws led to a hostile and often violent environment between the two groups. Several series of treaties between the United States government and tribal governments were signed in an attempt to establish boundary lines and prevent further violence.</dc:description>
