<dc:title>Fame of Memphis being spread throughout nation by establishment of chains of Piggly Wiggly stores</dc:title>
<dc:description>This newspaper article discusses the growing development of the Piggly Wiggly store chain and the self-service grocery store concept.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Clarence Saunders invented the modern supermarket in Memphis, Tennessee in 1916. Prior to Saunder's innovation, grocery stores usually were places where merchandise was stacked to the ceiling along the walls behind counters. A customer would have to tell the clerk what items she/he wanted and then the clerk would retrieve them. Saunders's "Piggly Wiggly" stores allowed customers to get merchandise themselves by taking a basket and going up and down aisles until they reached the check out stand where they would purchase their groceries they had collected.</dc:description>
