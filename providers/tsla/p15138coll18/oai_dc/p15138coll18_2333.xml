<dc:title>Correspondence from Martin Boyd of Newbern, Tennessee in Governor Austin Peay's papers</dc:title>
<dc:description>This piece of correspondence from Martin Boyd of Newbern, Tennessee is found in Governor Austin Peay's papers. It references publicity found in the newspaper The Press-Scimitar of Memphis suggesting that Governor Austin Peay received a stimulant in the form of intoxicating liquor when he was ill. Mr. Boyd suggests that the "manner in which this commonplace information is presented arouses suspicion that an attempt will be made to get the prohibition laws modified" and poses the question, "Can it be that the Press-Scimitar desires a return of the 'prescription saloon'?"</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Prohibition movement was organized in the middle of the 19th century as part of a religious movement. As its popularity increased, several states banned consumption of alcohol. The 18th Amendment (passed 1917, ratified 1919) and the Volstead Act (passed 1920) both supplemented the movement, attempting to ban all alcohol in the United States. The 21st Amendment repealed the Prohibition laws in 1933. </dc:description>
