<dc:description>A letter from Representative Chandler to Gov. Browning detailing the progress of the bill to create the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.

<dc:description>For many years visitors to the Great Smoky Mountains were impressed by the natural beauty and argued for the region to be protected as a national park. By the1920s, Knoxville civic leaders and others began serious efforts to promote the creation of the national park. A bill to establish the Smokies as a national park was presented to Congress in 1937 and passed with little resistance. In September of 1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt came to East Tennessee to officially dedicate the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. </dc:description>
