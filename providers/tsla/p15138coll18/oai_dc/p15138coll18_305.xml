<dc:title>Electromagnetic plant, also known as Y-12</dc:title>
<dc:description>This photograph shows the Y-12 electromagnetic isotope separation plant at Oak Ridge used to separate the fissile u-235 isotopes from natural uranium. On the back of the photo is written: Electromagnetic plant at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, also known as Y-12. Operated for the Atomic Energy Commission by Union Carbide Corporation.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Y-12 was the World War II code name for the electromagnetic isotope separation plant at Oak Ridge. The plant began operations in 1943 using an electromagnetic process developed at the University of California, Berkeley. A large portion of the u-235 used in the "Little Boy" atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima was harvested at this site. This site is now known as the Y-12 National Security Complex.</dc:description>
