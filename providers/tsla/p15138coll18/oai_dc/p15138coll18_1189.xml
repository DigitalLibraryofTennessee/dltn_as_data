<dc:title>Map of Cornelia Fort Airport</dc:title>
<dc:description>Hand-drawn map of Cornelia Fort Air Park. This small airport was established near Cornelia Fort's childhood home, Fortland Farms. The land was purchased by Nashville's Metro Park Service in 2011 to become part of the Shelby Bottoms Greenway and Nature Park. Though the airport is no longer in service, there is a historical marker about Cornelia Fort on the property. </dc:description>
<dc:description>Cornelia Fort was the first female pilot in Nashville to earn her pilot's license. Before the United States entered World War II, she worked as flight instructor and was giving a lesson in Hawaii when she nearly collided with a Japanese plane headed for Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Shortly after, Fort returned to the United States and was the second woman to join the Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron, a predecessor of the Women's Airforce Service Pilots. She became the first woman to die in military service during WWII when her airplane collided with another aircraft during a ferrying mission. </dc:description>
