<dc:title>How efficient is a great big hungry army</dc:title>
<dc:description>This political cartoon was drawn by the famous Tennessean newspaper artist, Jack Knox. The drawing shows an idle plow labeled "food production" in an overgrowing field. A sign hangs on the handle of the plow saying, "Gone to the war and war industries."</dc:description>
<dc:description>World War II brought a great need for soldiers on the battlefield and employees in the war industries. The need for food production also increased in order to provide food for all of the soldiers and aid to other countries in need. The government used the "Plant to Prosper" campaign in an effort to encourage farmers to stay on their farms instead of leaving for a job in industry.</dc:description>
