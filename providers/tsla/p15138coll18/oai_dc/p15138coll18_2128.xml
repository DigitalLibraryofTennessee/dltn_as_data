<dc:title>Letter from John Ross to Majors Irwin and Barron regarding the Treaty of New Echota</dc:title>
<dc:description>This is a 2-page letter written by Cherokee Chief John Ross and addressed to Majors Irwin and Barron. Ross states that the Cherokee Council does not approve of the "nefarious 'treaty' and declared it to be a fraud... and an act of oppression on the Cherokees." He goes on to say that the Cherokee Council is willing to meet with officers from the United States Government to create an approved treaty that will satisfy both the Cherokees and the United States. He goes on to say it is his goal to serve the wishes of the Cherokee people as a whole. Additionally, in a post script, Ross states that there are pending cases in court about illegal fees collected that have not been dealt with and expects the recipients will take care of them.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the American government continually pressed the Cherokee Nation to cede their ancestral lands and remove to lands west of the Mississippi River. The Cherokee Council, led by Chief John Ross, ardently opposed the idea of removal. However, in 1835, a minority group of Cherokees supporting removal negotiated with the United States without the approval of the Cherokee Council. This fraudulent treaty, which became known as the Treaty of New Echota, ceded all Cherokee lands to the United States and allotted two years for the voluntary relocation of the Tribe. The Cherokee Council made several attempts to renegotiate an approved treaty over the following two-year period when the enforced removal began in 1838.</dc:description>
