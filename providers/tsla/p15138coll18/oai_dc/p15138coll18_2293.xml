<dc:title>Letter from Jean Anderson to Sadie Warner Frazer regarding the latest news from Europe</dc:title>
<dc:description>Jean Anderson begins her letter by acknowledging receipt of Sadie's letter and her appreciation of the news from home. She comments on the quality of life for the people living in the combat areas of Europe and how she does not understand how people can still live in such devastated areas. She expresses disbelief of the blind faith of the German people in Hitler's propaganda. She closes her letter by hoping to see Preston soon and feeling comforted knowing he is also in Europe.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Frazer and Anderson families became acquainted while Colonel George Augustine Frazer was stationed in Hawaii in the late 1930s. After the United States entered World War II, Jean Anderson joined the Red Cross and served overseas in the Civilian War Relief department. Anderson maintained consistent correspondence with the Frazer framily throughout and after the war.</dc:description>
