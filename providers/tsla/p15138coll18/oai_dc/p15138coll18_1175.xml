<dc:title>Interview with Elise Steiner about the hospitality of the Nashville community when soldiers came into town from their nearby stations</dc:title>
<dc:description>Video interview of Elise Steiner by Susan Gordon of the Tennessee Historical Society. In this clip, Gordon states that there were thousands of men stationed in the areas surrounding Nashville for maneuvers who would come into town on the weekends and asked what the town was like when they were visiting. Steiner responds that a lot of people opened their homes and invited them home to dinner or to stay the weekend with them, including her and her husband. Gordon asks what they did with the soldiers, and she responds that they did not try to set the men up on dates; they just tried to be a mother and father figure to the men and talk to them and feed them. She said often it would be the same group that would call on the weekends and ask to stay with them.</dc:description>
