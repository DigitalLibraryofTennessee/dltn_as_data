<dc:title>Elizabethton Hosiery Mill employees</dc:title>
<dc:description>Shows employees, mostly women, in front of the Elizabethton Hosiery Mill</dc:description>
<dc:description>Elizabethton was the site of a textile strike in 1929. The strike for higher pay started when young women, many not older than teenagers, led workers out of two German-owned rayon mills. Many citizens sided with the strikers. Governor Horton sent in the National Guard to protect strikebreakers and the rayon plants. The Guard set up defenses on the mills' rooftops, while women workers blocked the access roads to the plants, and men dynamited the houses of "scabs" and the Elizabethon water main. About 1,250 people were arrested for confrontations with the Guard. Eventually, the strikers lost and many were blacklisted. The Elizabethton strike demonstrated the militancy of supposedly docile workers and the independence of young rural women. The organizers of the strike considered Elizabethton a test case for textile organizing in the South. Though the result was negative, labor militancy lingered in Elizabethon.</dc:description>
