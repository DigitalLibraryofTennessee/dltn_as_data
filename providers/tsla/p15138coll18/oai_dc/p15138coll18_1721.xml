<dc:description>Letter from F. A. Carter, President and General Manager of the American Textile Woolen Company encouraging Governor Hill McAlister to oppose the child labor amendment to the U.S. Constitution. </dc:description>
<dc:description>In 1938, President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Fair Labor Standards Act, which, in part, restricted the employment and abuse of child workers. The Act restricted children under age 16 from working during school hours. Prior ot the Act, many employers preferred hiring children because they were usually cheaper, more manageable, and less likely to strike.</dc:description>
