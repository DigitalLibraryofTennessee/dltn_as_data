<dc:title>Circular by General Winfield Scott regarding a military escort for the Cherokee detachments during Removal </dc:title>
<dc:description>This circular is General Winfield Scott's reply to a letter sent from the Secretary of War to Tennessee Governor Newton Cannon. In his circular to Governor Cannon, General Scott states he was asked by the War Department if a military escort would be necessary to protect the emigrants and maintain order during the removal of the Cherokee people to the western territory. General Scott states that he does not think an escort is needed because everyone will show orderly behavior. He states that the conductors of the detachments have sworn to keep order among their poeople and punish offenders if necessary. He goes on to say that since August, the good opinion of the Cherokees has not changed and he hopes that opinion will remain the same during their travels. He assures Governor Cannon that a copy of this circular will be distributed to the conductors of each detachment and he is waiting to hear from those groups that have already begun their journey.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the American government continually pressed the Cherokee Nation to cede their ancestral lands and remove to lands west of the Mississippi River. President Andrew Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act of 1830 which authorized the U. S. government to negotiate with the Native American tribes treaties for the cession of lands and removal west. The Cherokee Council, led by Chief John Ross, ardently opposed the idea of removal. However, in 1835, a minority group of Cherokees supporting removal negotiated with the United States without the approval of the Cherokee Council. This fraudulent treaty, which became known as the Treaty of New Echota, ceded all Cherokee lands east of the Mississippi River to the United States and allotted two years for the voluntary relocation of the tribe. At the end of this two year period, General Winfield Scott was ordered to the Eastern Cherokee Territory to oversee the military-enforced removal of the remaining Cherokees.</dc:description>
