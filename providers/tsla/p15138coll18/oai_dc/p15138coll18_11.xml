<dc:description>The Rev. A. Powell Davies and others, including reporters in the Soviet Union, used this image to support their argument that the United States had a callous and flippant attitude toward use of nuclear weapons after World War II. In the summer of 1946, after World War II had ended, a Joint Army Navy task force conducted the largest American nuclear weapon tests at Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Known as Operation Crossroads, the purpose of these tests was to determine how effective nuclear bombs would be against navy ships. Two tests, known as ABLE and BAKER were conducted. Navy Vice Admiral William H.P. Blandy led the operation. Ninety-five decommissioned ships were present and live animals were placed on these ships to determine how the bombs would impact living creatures. They were the first tests publicly announced and observed by an audience, which included a large press contingent. Operations Crossroads ended on August 10, 1946 due to concerns about radiation. However, the United States would go on to test nuclear weapons in the Marshall Islands until 1958. </dc:description>
