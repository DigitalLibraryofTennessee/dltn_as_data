<dc:title>Letter from Lewis Ross to John Ross updating him on the latest news about an election and treaty for removal</dc:title>
<dc:description>This 4-page letter was written by Lewis Ross to his brother, Cherokee Chief John Ross. In the letter, L. Ross describes a vote that was taken by the Cherokees about the payment of monies due the Tribe according to former treaties. He describes the location of the vote, to whom the payments would be made, how many voted, and who was appointed as judges of the vote. He goes on to describe how General Wool announced there had been a treaty made that would require the removal of the Cherokees within two years and if they did not comply, they would be forcibly removed by United States Troops, and there were various provisions being offered to them. Ross says that the people did not seem impressed by the speech, remarking that they had no desire for the items being offered. At the end of the election, General Wool invited several of the leading men to visit him, and they discussed the removal and he encouraged them to take some of the provisions. Ross immediately suggests his brother look into the amount of money that was reported as due to the Cherokees, thinking they were quoted the wrong amount. He also describes the arrests of several Cherokees on charges of opposing the Treaty and exciting the people against it. He conveys the anxiety of the people waiting to know what the results of the delegation in Washington will mean for their Nation.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the American government continually pressed the Cherokee Nation to cede their ancestral lands and remove to lands west of the Mississippi River. The Cherokee Council, led by Chief John Ross, ardently opposed the idea of removal. However, in 1835, a minority group of Cherokees supporting removal negotiated with the United States without the approval of the Cherokee Council. This fraudulent treaty, which became known as the Treaty of New Echota, ceded all Cherokee lands to the United States and allotted two years for the voluntary relocation of the Tribe. The Cherokee Council made several attempts to renegotiate an approved treaty over the following two-year period when the enforced removal began in 1838.</dc:description>
