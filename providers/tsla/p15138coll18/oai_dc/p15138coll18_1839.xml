<dc:title>Condensed facts about the south from "Manufacturers' Record", Baltimore</dc:title>
<dc:description>This pamphlet presents "facts" about the South between 1865 and 1900, and concisely illustrates the South's economic growth during the Reconstruction due to industrialization. It comes from a larger booklet called "Manufacturers' Record's Baltimore-Southern Supplement."</dc:description>
<dc:description>During Reconstruction, industrialization was key to the South's economic recovery and growth. More so, the large-scale industrialization is indicative of the New South, an ideal based on modernization of the South's society and attitudes in order to integrate more fully with the rest of the nation. In other words, the New South meant moving away from the economy and traditions of the Old South and slavery-based plantation system.</dc:description>
