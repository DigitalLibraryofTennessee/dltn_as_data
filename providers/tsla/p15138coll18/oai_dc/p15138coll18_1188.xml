<dc:title>Gasoline Alley comic strip about women in industrial work during WWII</dc:title>
<dc:description>This comic strip features a woman working in a bronze foundry who has asked to learn how to do a new job, but her supervisor tells her it is a man's job. She insists she thinks she could learn it and asks if he will show her. He makes the declaration at the end of the strip that the trouble with women in the work place is that they think they can do anything a man can. </dc:description>
<dc:description>World War II was the catalyst that brought change in the gender roles held for women. Because of the labor shortage produced by men joining the armed forces during World War II, women were encouraged to takes jobs in nearly every industry. Many men were resentful of women's presence in the work place and traditional gender roles had limited the job descriptions of women. However, the necessity for manpower during the war allowed women to extend the boundaries of the work they could perform outside the home.</dc:description>
