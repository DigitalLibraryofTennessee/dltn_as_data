<dc:title>Letter from superintendent of quarantine to president of state board of health about grave depths and drainage in fever victim cemeteries</dc:title>
<dc:description>The Superintendant of Quarantine John Johnson writes this letter to the President of the State Board of Health, J.D. Plunket, to discuss the depths of graves in a cemetery called Elmwood which contains yellow fever victims. Johnson is worried because the grave diggers in that cemetery were digging graves only four and a half feet deep. He suggests that the graves be dug five and a half feet deep because drainage from the Elmwood cemetery goes right through the city of Memphis. </dc:description>
<dc:description>Yellow Fever devastated the city of Memphis in the 1870s. In 1873, 2,000 were killed by the disease. When the disease returned in late July 1878, 25,000 residents fled the city. Between August and October of 1878, the disease killed more than 5,000 people. Towns along the railroads leading out of Memphis also experienced significant losses due to the epidemic. Yellow Fever caused fever, chills, hemorrhaging, severe pain, a yellowing of the skin, and vomit that was black in color.</dc:description>
