<dc:title>Letter to John V. Wright from Frances O. Smith regarding women's suffrage</dc:title>
<dc:description>Letter dated January 30, 1917 to John V. Wright from his presumed neighbor and landlord, Frances O. Smith. Writing on stationery from the Union County Woman Suffrage Organization, Smith describes her upcoming position as secretary of the organization. In the letter, she also describes her curiosity with the Tennessee senate and their upcoming vote on suffrage. She questions why there has been a delay in the vote since she believes suffrage is "certainly coming."</dc:description>
<dc:description>The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Josephine A. Pearson (1868-1944) was an educator from Monteagle who became president of the Tennessee State Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage and the Southern Woman's League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment. She worked tirelessly with various women's groups, religious and political leaders throughout Tennessee in an unsuccessful effort to prevent the passage of women's suffrage.</dc:description>
