<dc:title>And When It Does--!</dc:title>
<dc:description>This political cartoon depicts the world dressed as a farmer, addressing a hen labeled "German Terrorism" sitting atop artillery labeled "DuPont Products." The world is saying "Pardon me, Madame, but that hardware is going to hatch any minute-!" A rooster with a mustache, representing German Emperor Wilhelm II, observes their conversation in the background near a coop.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Old Hickory Powder Plant in Old Hickory, Tenn. near Nashville was a large smokeless powder plant opened by DuPont Engineering Company in 1918. The powder produced at the plant could be used for firearms and artillery. Though plant construction was not completed by the time the Armistice was signed, five of the six powder units were operational and produced 501,000 pounds of powder a day.</dc:description>
