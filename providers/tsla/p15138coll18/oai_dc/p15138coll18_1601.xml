<dc:title>Letter from Wesley Class No. 3</dc:title>
<dc:description>Letter from the Wesley Class No. 3 of the Carroll Street Church to Governor Hill McAlister offering support for a recent address he made to the Tennessee State Legislature encouraging adoption of the Child Labor Amendment. The letter goes on to say "We believe that children in industry or other employment cannot adequately be protected without Federal legislation." Twelve women have added their signatures to the letter. </dc:description>
<dc:description>In 1938, President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Fair Labor Standards Act, which, in part, restricted the employment and abuse of child workers. The Act restricted children under age 16 from working during school hours. Prior ot the Act, many employers preferred hiring children because they were usually cheaper, more manageable, and less likely to strike. </dc:description>
