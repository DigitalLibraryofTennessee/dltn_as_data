<dc:description>The Office of Price Administration (OPA) was a New Deal agency created in 1941 to: (1) stabilize prices and rents, (2) prevent profiteering and hoarding, (3) protect citizens with fixed incomes from lower living standards, and (4) encourage production. During the war, the government asked Americans to sacrifice certain luxuries and necessities, so the OPA established a system of rationing that included gasoline, tires, cars, bicycles, shoes, zippers, bobby pins, nylons, stoves, sugar, butter, coffee, meat, and cooking fat, and many other items for military use.The war in Europe and in the Pacific caused many shortages on the home front, and rationing was a way to fairly distribute items. (Unfortunately, the black market thrived on the illegal resale of ration books.) On the back cover of Mrs. Avery's Ration Book Four is an important statement: "When you have used your ration, salvage the TIN CANS and WASTE FATS. They are needed to make munitions for our fighting men." On the home front people organized scrap metal, tire, tin foil, and shoe drives. Bacon fat, for instance, was used in making ammunition and explosives. Each ration booklet contained several pages of coupons, labelled variously for sugar, coffee, gasoline, etc. Others were printed with mysterious combinations of letters and numbers. </dc:description>
