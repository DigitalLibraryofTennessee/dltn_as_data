<dc:title>The income tax</dc:title>
<dc:description>Clipping from the Nashville American concerning the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan and Trust Co. The writer notes that effect of the ruling will "absolutely protect the class of capitalists most offensive to the populistic element."</dc:description>
<dc:description>Though the U.S. Congress passed an income tax law in 1894, it was rendered impracticable by the Supreme Court in 1895. An exemption on income from rent or interest on personal property did not completely overturn the law, but made it toothless from the standpoint of the Populists. Not until the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913 would their vision of an effective income tax be realized.</dc:description>
