<dc:title>Letter from W.R. Hamilton to Senator Edward Ward Carmack</dc:title>

</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Prohibition movement was organized in the middle of the 19th century as part of a religious movement. As its popularity increased, several states banned consumption of alcohol. The 18th Amendment (passed 1917, ratified 1919) and the Volstead Act (passed 1920) both supplemented the movement, attempting to ban all alcohol in the United States. The 21st Amendment repealed the Prohibition laws in 1933. </dc:description>
