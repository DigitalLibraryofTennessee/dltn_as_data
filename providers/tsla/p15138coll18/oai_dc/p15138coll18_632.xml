<dc:description>Home canning already had a long history in Tennessee. During the World War II period it received new attention. Through the use of posters, the United States government encouraged Americans to start "victory gardens" and can produce at home. Victory gardens would reduce reliance on limited food rations and help families put aside for winter. Convincing citizens to can at home also relieved pressure on the canning industry, allowing them to focus on producing food for soldiers and reducing the amount of tin used. Like all other war efforts, home canning and victory gardens brought US citizens together in support of the war effort.</dc:description>
