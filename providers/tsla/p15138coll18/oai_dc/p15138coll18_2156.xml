<dc:title>Letter from Samuel Cooper to Newton Cannon regarding the possible need for a military escort for the Cherokee emigrants</dc:title>
<dc:description>This letter was written by the Secretary of War, Samuel Cooper, to Tennessee Governor Newton Cannon suggesting he may need to supply soldiers to General Winfield Scott to serve as a guard to escort the Cherokee people to the West. He expresses concern that there could be hostile behavior against or by the Cherokees during their removal and General Scott has the authority to request forces from Tennessee if needed.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the American government continually pressed the Cherokee Nation to cede their ancestral lands and remove to lands west of the Mississippi River. President Andrew Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act of 1830 which authorized the U. S. government to negotiate with the Native American tribes treaties for the cession of lands and removal west. The Cherokee Council, led by Chief John Ross, ardently opposed the idea of removal. However, in 1835, a minority group of Cherokees supporting removal negotiated with the United States without the approval of the Cherokee Council. This fraudulent treaty, which became known as the Treaty of New Echota, ceded all Cherokee lands east of the Mississippi River to the United States and allotted two years for the voluntary relocation of the Tribe. At the end of this two year period, General Winfield Scott was ordered to the Eastern Cherokee Territory to oversee the military-enforced removal of the remaining Cherokees.</dc:description>
