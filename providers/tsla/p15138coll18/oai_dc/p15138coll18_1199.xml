<dc:title>Explosion of biddle and company's congress water fount</dc:title>
<dc:description>A political cartoon that satirizes the failure of the combined efforts of Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, John Calhoun, and Nicholas Biddle to thwart Andrew Jackson's treasury policy of ending the National Bank of the United States.</dc:description>
<dc:description>During the presidency of Andrew Jackson, one of the issues he faced was the rechartering of the Second Bank of the United States. Since the Bank of the United States was a privately owned entity, Jackson and his followers distrusted the institution on the basis that it answered only to its directors and stockholders. Jackson, like his western constituents, felt the Bank of the United States was a greedy monopoly, catering to the financial elites of the nation, rather than the public. With the Bank charter due to expire in 1836, the President of the Bank of the United States, Nicholas Biddle, in alliance with the National Republicans under Senator Henry Clay (KY) and Senator Daniel Webster (MA), decided to make rechartering a referendum on the legitimacy of the institution in the general election of 1832. After Andrew Jackson was reelected as president, he quickly turned his attention to ending the Bank of the United States. In 1833, President Andrew Jackson ordered that federal deposits be removed from the Bank of the United States. This action was very controversial and it eventually led to the destruction of the Bank of the United States.</dc:description>
