<dc:title>Careless talk...got there first</dc:title>
<dc:description>This poster from World War II shows a soldier attached to a parachute landing. He is clearly injured or dead. Additional parachuting soldiers are featured in the background. The reverse of the poster explains its content by saying "This poignant poster, graphically portraying a possible result of someone's thoughtless talk, is the work of Herbert Morton Stoops." According to the poster, Mr. Stoops was a battery commander during World War I who gained notoriety as an artist in the field of military activity.</dc:description>
