<dc:title>Help us strike the liquor vampire from the breast of Tennessee</dc:title>
<dc:description>This broadside details the evils of liquor consumption by Tennesseans. It provides a list of items and behaviors currently prohibited in the United States, and states that the "liquor vampire" is the "greatest public curse; the vilest deceiver; the most fruitful breeder of discord, poverty, crime, and immorality." It also suggests that liquor helped "plunge us into war at Pearl Harbor" and costs Tennesseans over $285,000,000.00 per year in Federal Income Tax. </dc:description>
<dc:description>The Prohibition movement was organized in the middle of the 19th century as part of a religious movement. As its popularity increased, several states banned consumption of alcohol. The 18th Amendment (passed 1917, ratified 1919) and the Volstead Act (passed 1920) both supplemented the movement, attempting to ban all alcohol in the United States. The 21st Amendment repealed the Prohibition laws in 1933. </dc:description>
