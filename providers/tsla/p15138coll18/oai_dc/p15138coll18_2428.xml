<dc:title>Photograph of the atom bomb burst at Bikini Atoll- DA-PEM-3-55-8</dc:title>
<dc:description>According to note on the reverse of image, this photograph was taken within a few minutes after the detonation of the atomic bomb tested at Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands. The photograph shows a billowing cloud of smoke and flame caught in various stages of formation by a Navy patrol bomber flying beyond range of the explosion. The photograph is identified as file number DA-PEM-3-55-8 and was one of the first series of aerial view photographs to be flown to the United States for publication. </dc:description>
<dc:description>In the summer of 1946, after World War II had ended, a Joint Army Navy task force conducted the largest American nuclear weapon tests at Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Known as Operation Crossroads, the purpose of these tests was to determine how effective nuclear bombs would be against navy ships. Two tests, known as ABLE and BAKER were conducted. Navy Vice Admiral William H.P. Blandy led the operation. Ninety-five decommissioned ships were present and live animals were placed on these ships to determine how the bombs would impact living creatures. They were the first tests publicly announced and observed by an audience, which included a large press contingent. Operations Crossroads ended on August 10, 1946 due to concerns about radiation. However, the United States would go on to test nuclear weapons in the Marshall Islands until 1958. </dc:description>
