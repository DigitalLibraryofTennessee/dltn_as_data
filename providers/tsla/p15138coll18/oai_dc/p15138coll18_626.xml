<dc:title>A Letter from James Robertson, of Tennessee, to His Excellency John Sevier, Esquire, Governor of the State of Franklin, 1 August 1787</dc:title>
<dc:description>Five-page privately printed and numbered (Number 21 of 100) portfolio containing an August 1, 1787 letter penned by James Robertson to John Sevier. Writing from Nashville, Robertson recounts Native American atrocities in the region and informs the governor of Franklin of the anticipated danger posed to the Cumberland settlements by the uniting of the Chickasaws, Creeks, and Cherokees to cut off the area in the upcoming fall. Robertson is hoping for the construction of a military station near the mouth of the Elk River or military intervention, and he asks the Governor to use his influence.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Feeling cut-off from a distant, uncomprehending, and unresponsive seat of government in North Carolina, western residents of the Holston-Watauga region felt compelled to seize the opportunity and establish the order, justice, and security they craved and felt was their inalienable right. Thus, they established the independent State of Franklin in 1784.  The Native Americans inhabiting the area proved the chief threat to that security in both the settlements of Franklin and the Cumberland, as this entreating letter from James Robertson to Franklin governor John Sevier attests.  Robertson, seeking aid for the embattled Cumberland settlers in 1787, clearly expected Governor Sevier to relate to their plight.  In the case of the State of Franklin, continued encroachment of white settlers on Native American territories and conflicting treaties sparked atrocities from both sides and turned sporadic clashes into warfare.  Lack of recognition from the United States, continued conciliatory offers from North Carolina, confusion in government operation springing from dual elections and courts, factionalism, and Native American conflicts undermined support for the fledgling State of Franklin and led to its undoing in 1788.</dc:description>
