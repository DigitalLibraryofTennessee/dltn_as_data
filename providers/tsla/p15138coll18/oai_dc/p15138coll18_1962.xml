<dc:title>Mexican Village Interesting Feature of Old Hickory</dc:title>
<dc:description>Photograph and article describing the community of Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Native American workers at a Tennessee munitions plant printed in the Old Hickory News, a newsletter for the Old Hickory Powder Plant.</dc:description>
<dc:description>At the Old Hickory Powder Plant, an entire city was established for the more than 30,000 people who lived in the worker's housing. About 1,400 of these residents were men, women, and children of Mexican and Puerto Rican descent who lived in a community known as the "Mexican Village." About 50 Native Americans from a reservation in Navajo, New Mexico also lived in this community. These workers were mainly employed by subcontractor, Mason &amp; Hanger Company, who maintained the village. Between 1910 and 1920, there was an influx of Mexican immigrants to the United States due to the Mexican Revolution and provisions under the Immigration Act of 1917 that allowed Mexican immigrants to forego literacy tests. These immigrants filled manufacturing and agricultural jobs in the South left vacant by the military draft and the Great Migration of African Americans. The Old Hickory Powder Plant in Old Hickory, Tenn. near Nashville was a large smokeless powder plant opened by DuPont Engineering Company in 1918. The powder produced at the plant could be used for firearms and artillery. Though plant construction was not completed by the time the Armistice was signed, five of the six powder units were operation and produced 501,000 pounds of powder a day. </dc:description>
