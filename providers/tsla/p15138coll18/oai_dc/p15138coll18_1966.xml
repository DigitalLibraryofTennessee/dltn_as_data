<dc:title>Two female Red Cross volunteers, another woman, and a man at a Red Cross booth during World War I</dc:title>
<dc:description>According to the volume, Davidson County Women in the World War, 1914-1919, this photograph depicts one of the first Red Cross booths erected in Davidson County. Volunteers at these booths solicited memberships for the Nashville Chapter, A.R.C. Miss Reba Wilson Gray is seated inside the booth, and Miss Annie Laurie Campbell is pinning a Red Cross button on a subscriber. The two women are dressed in Red Cross volunteer uniforms, including white veiled caps with the Red Cross insignia.  The booth's sign says: "10,000,000 Members By Christmas for the American Red Cross. $1.00" The poster behind the booth says: "Ten Million New Members by Christmas. Join the American Red Cross and on Christmas Eve a candle in every window, a service flag for every home."</dc:description>
<dc:description>After the Selective Service Act of 1917 was passed, many American men were drafted into military service during World War I. Shortage of male labor provided women with opportunities to enter the workforce or volunteer to participate in the war effort. American women volunteered on the homefront and overseas in organizations like the Red Cross in various roles. Some women assisted soldiers' families or produced garments and medical supplies for troops and victims of war through local chapters, while others took on various positions within the organization, such as nurses and drivers.</dc:description>
