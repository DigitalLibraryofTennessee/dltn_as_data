<dc:title>The banker, or the crank</dc:title>
<dc:description>Clipping from the Farmers' Alliance, reprinted from the National Economist, highlighting the anti-banking views popular among Alliancemen. The author discusses disparities in business practices between other industries and the banking sector, which lords over goverment, railroads, and the people to "rule with despotic power every condition of life." Also included is a piece on the conflict with the jute-bagging trust, a primary foe of cotton farmers, who fought soaring packaging costs due to the trust's monopolistic practices.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Populism may be best seen as a movement to support the economic interests of the common man, or the populace at large versus monopolies and moneyed interests. The explosion of investment banking that accompandied the rapid growth of the American economy was therefore ripe for criticism from the populist element. The Populists' insistence on cooperation in opposition to monopoly has in turn left them vulnerable to a pejorative association with socialism.</dc:description>
