<dc:description>The Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area is a United States National Recreation Area located in Kentucky and Tennessee between Lake Barkley and Kentucky Lake. The recreation area was originally formed by the Tennessee Valley Authority in the 1940s. As a result of the development of a dam, a lake known as Kentucky Lake was formed and flooded some of the low-lying land in the area. Some of the farmers that lived in the area were forced to move to other places. Although the recreation area was managed by the TVA for awhile, it was eventually transferred to the United States Forest Service. The area was designated a national recreation area by President John F. Kennedy in 1963.</dc:description>
