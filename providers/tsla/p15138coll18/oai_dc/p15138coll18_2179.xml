<dc:title>Kasper Mansker's narrative</dc:title>
<dc:description>A four-page manuscript handwritten in ink on paper.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Kasper Mansker (1750-1820) was one of the few long hunters to leave a record of his hunting travels for posterity. The manuscript shown was found in the papers of Justice John Haywood, author of The Civil and Political History of the State of Tennessee, the first history of our state. It is uncertain whether Mansker wrote this account himself or dictated it to another person, possibly to Haywood. His narrative indicates that on their first hunt in the Middle Tennessee area Mansker and several of his fellow long hunters were familiar enough with the geography of the land to embark on a journey down the Cumberland to the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. They then followed the Mississippi all the way to New Orleans, where they sold the hides and meat they had gathered on their hunt. Mansker returned to the Middle Tennessee area several times with different parties before settling there permanently about 1780. He was a signer of the original Cumberland Compact, and played a very active role in the Indian Wars of the 1780s and 1790s, serving as an officer in the militia and participating in the Nickajack raids of 1794. He is reputed to have fought at the Battle of New Orleans as a private soldier in the Second Regiment of Tennessee Volunteer Mounted Gunmen, when he would have been more than sixty years old. He died at his home in Sumner County in late 1820, having traveled and lived in the Middle Tennessee area for more than fifty years from the time he first visited the area in 1768.
