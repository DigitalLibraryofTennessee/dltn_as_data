<dc:title>Veteran survey for Eleanor Virginia Harris</dc:title>
<dc:description>WWII veteran survey submitted by Eleanor Virginia Harris who served in the U.S. Coast Guard Women's Reserve (SPARs) between 1943 and 1946. In this survey, she describes her enlistment, responsibilities and living conditions during the war. In her survey she confesses that her mother was opposed to her joining the military, but she enlisted before hearing her mother's opinion. This was a common occurance during World War II. Harris submitted a supplemental photograph along with her survey.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Because of the volume of soldiers needed on the front lines of World War II, the United States government allowed women to fill non-combatant positions in the military in order to release as many men as possible for fighting. Every branch of the military incorporated women into their ranks in some fashion. In 1996, in an effort to expand its holdings about World War II, the Tennessee State Library and Archives sent surveys to World War II veterans from or currently living in Tennessee. Over 7000 veterans, or family members of veterans, returned completed questionnaires, often submitting additional supplemental materials, such as photographs, with their surveys.</dc:description>
