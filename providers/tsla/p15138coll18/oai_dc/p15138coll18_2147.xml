<dc:title>Letter from Lewis Ross to Robert Houston regarding a survey of his land</dc:title>
<dc:description>In this hand-written letter, Lewis Ross is expressing concern about the surveying of his land. Ross states that he and the surveyer of his property, Robert Armstrong, are under differing opinions of where Ross can establish his property line according to a recent treaty. Ross was under the impression the provisions only specified that the property had to be in a square and had to include certain improvements. According to Ross, Armstrong believed Ross' house must be located in the center of the property. Ross' concern with his house being in the center of the property is that he would lose a large portion of fields below his ferry.</dc:description>
<dc:description>An 1819 treaty between the Cherokee Nation and the United States made provisions for the reservations of lands for the Cherokee. Robert Armstrong III was appointed to be the U. S. Surveyor for the reservations provided for by this treaty.</dc:description>
