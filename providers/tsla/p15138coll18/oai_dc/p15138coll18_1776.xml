<dc:title>"State Child Labor Law Not Changed"</dc:title>
<dc:description>This article states that though the federal child labor law was deemed unconstitutional by the US Supreme Court, the Tennessee child labor law will still be enforced.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The federal labor law made it illegal for goods made with child labor to cross state lines. In declaring it unconstitutional, the Supreme Court said that it was an overly broad use of the Commerce Clause, which is why it didn't have any effect on state child labor laws.</dc:description>
