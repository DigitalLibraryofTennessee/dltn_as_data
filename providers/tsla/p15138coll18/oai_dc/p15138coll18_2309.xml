<dc:title>Letter from Mary Washington Frazer to her parents regarding her discharge</dc:title>
<dc:description>In this letter, Mary Frazer announces that she has received the news of her discharge date, comments that she will miss the Marine Corps, and says she will begin shipping her possessions home. She mentions an ad that she enclosed and asks to know the family's plans for the summer.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Because of the volume of soldiers needed on the front lines during World War II, the United States government allowed women to fill non-combatant positions in the military in order to release as many men as possible for fighting. Every branch of the military incorporated women into their ranks in some fashion. At the end of World War II, most of the women who had enlisted in the military were discharged and expected to return to traditional feminine roles. However, small numbers of women remained a part of each branch and were able to continue their military careers. The MCWR was made a permanent part of the U.S. Marine Corps in 1948 with the Armed Forces Integration Act.</dc:description>
