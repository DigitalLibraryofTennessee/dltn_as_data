<dc:title>A call for a convention</dc:title>
<dc:description>This article announces a convention to be held in Nashville on May 19, 1875 for the purpose of deciding whether Tennessee's black citizens should remain in the state or migrate elsewhere. The announcement was placed in the paper by the Edgefield Real Estate Association. Benjamin "Pap" Singleton was one of the association's members.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Born a slave in Davidson County, Tennessee Benjamin "Pap" Singleton (1809-1892?) was one of the foremost exponents of black migration to the northern states. During his years as a slave, Singleton was sold to the Gulf States several times, but always managed to escape. He eventually fled to Canada, then settled in Detroit, Michigan. In the years following the Civil War Singleton became dismayed at the conditions under which the former slaves lived, and became convinced that his people's best chance for success lay in establishing independent communities far away from the South. The Edgefield Real Estate Association, which Singleton helped organize, was created to help the former slaves locate affordable land that they could settle and farm. Singleton found Kansas attractive because it offered federal homestead land. He travelled back and forth between Tennessee and Kansas, taking parties of emigrants with him, and&#65533;founded the "Singleton Colony" in Cherokee County, Kansas. Many of the communities that were established in Kansas failed for a variety of reasons, their residents moving elsewhere. Singleton eventually abandoned the idea of Kansas as a suitable place for black settlement, but never lost his conviction that the best solution would be the creation of a separate black state within the United States or, failing that, relocation to Africa. For many years it was widely held that Benjamin Singleton died in Kansas in 1892 and was buried in an unmarked grave. The Kansas Historical Society recently discovered through digitized records that he actually died in Jackson County, Missouri on 17 February 1900 at the age of 91, and is buried in an unmarked grave in Union Cemetery in Kansas City, Missouri.</dc:description>
