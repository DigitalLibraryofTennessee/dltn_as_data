<dc:title>Treaty Signing at Fort Loudon</dc:title>
<dc:description>British Lt. Henry Timberlake traveled to the Overhill Cherokee villages on the Little Tennessee River in late 1761 to explain the provisions of a peace treaty between an army of Viriginia colonists and a party of Cherokee leaders that had been signed at Fort Robinson on the Holston River earlier in that year.  He remained with the Cherokee until March 1762, keeping a journal that was subsequently published in England in 1765.  In addition to this map, his journal contained a detailed account of Cherokee customs. He later accompanied several Cherokee leaders, including Attakullakulla, the Little Carpenter, to London to meet with King George of England.  </dc:description>
<dc:description>This pencil sketch was created in 1941 for the mural "Discovery" located in the lobby of the John Sevier state office building in Nashville.  Fort Loudon was constructed by the English in 1756-57 on Cherokee land near modern-day Vonore, Tennessee, with the permission and encouragement of the Cherokee.  But relations between the English colonists and the Cherokee degenerated over the next three years.  In March 1760, the Cherokee laid seige to the fort, in large part due to the English detention and subsequent murder of twenty three members of a Cherokee peace party that had been promised safe passage.  Facing starvation, the English surrendered  the fort on August  8, 1760, in return for a promsie of safe passage back to the English settlements in the Carolinas.  The fort was evacuated on August 9.  On August 10 the retreatig English garrison was attacked by the Cherokee near Tellico Plains and twenty-nine members were killed, allegedly in retribution for the twenty-three Cherokee killed by the English.  Most other members of the garrison were imprisoned by the Cherokee and eventually ransomed by the English.  </dc:description>
