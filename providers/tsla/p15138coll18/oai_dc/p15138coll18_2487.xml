<dc:description>In the early decades of the Cold War, the United States government, through the Department of Defense, produced both literature, film, and training to help prepare the public against the threat of nuclear weapons. Geared toward both children and adults, this material advised the public on how to respond to the use of a nuclear weapon within the United States by a foreign government without always revealing how severe the impact of a nuclear attack would be. By the 1960s, the literature was more open about the impact of radiation on the body and focused on encouraging the public to contruct shelters.</dc:description>
