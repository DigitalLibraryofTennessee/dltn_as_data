<dc:title>Newspaper article containing a letter from President Andrew Jackson to the Cherokee Nation East concerning the treaty</dc:title>
<dc:description>This newspaper article announces a treaty was made between Indian Commissioner John F. Schermerhorn and a delegation from the Cherokee Tribe. Because of the length of the treaty, the publication could not print the entire treaty, but an included letter from President Andrew Jackson gives a summary of the treaty. In his letter, Jackson states that he has a longstanding regard for the Cherokee people and it is his wish that they know his feelings on their situation. He states that living among the white population is destroying their culture and to continue living in their ancestral lands would seal their doom. He refers to their numerous rejections of the United States to relocate though it would mean a better life, and the refusal to relocate has only brought more difficulty to their people. He continues to announce that a delegation of leaders who are favorable to remove have agreed to a treaty, though it must be approved by the full council of the Cherokee Nation, and the Nation is to be removed to a land "with a very fine climate adapted to your habits." Jackson then lists a summary of the stipulations and provisions that were included in the treaty, and the total sum that is to be paid to the Nation and acreage the Nation will receive in the West. He states it is his hope that the Nation will choose to remove and not subject their future generations to the turmoil that fate would bring should they stay.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the American government continually pressed the Cherokee Nation to cede their ancestral lands and remove to lands west of the Mississippi River. President Andrew Jackson, often referring to himself as a father or brother to the Native Americans, believed the best hope for the survival of the Native American tribes was removal and signed the Indian Removal Act of 1830 which authorized the United States government to negotiate with the Native American tribes treaties for the cession of lands and removal west. The Cherokee Council, led by Chief John Ross, ardently opposed the idea of removal. However, in 1835, a minority group of Cherokees supporting removal, known as the Ridge Party, negotiated with the United States without the approval of the Cherokee Council. John F. Schermerhorn served as an Indian Commissioner during the Removal Era and represented the U. S. Government during the negotiations with the Ridge Party. This fraudulent treaty, which became known as the Treaty of New Echota, ceded all Cherokee lands to the United States and allotted two years for the voluntary relocation of the Tribe. The Cherokee Council made several attempts to renegotiate an approved treaty over the following two-year period when the enforced removal began in 1838.</dc:description>
