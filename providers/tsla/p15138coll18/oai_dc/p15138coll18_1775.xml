<dc:title>"Child Labor"</dc:title>
<dc:description>This is an article from the Birmingham Ledger, printed in the Nashville American charging Tennessee Governor Patterson with the protection of children with regard to labor issues. This article comes after Patterson called a congress of manufactuers and leaders of organized labor to meet to discuss child labor.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This article from the Birmingham Ledger, reprinted in the Nashville American, is an example of larger involvement and interest in the child labor movement. Citizens of the state of Alabama called for Tennessee's Governor Patterson to support child labor legislation in a conference called by him. The pressure exerted by forces inside and outside of Tennessee on Governor Patterson to approve legislation on child labor is indicative of the national political climate, as other states' and the federal government were pressed to pass similar laws.</dc:description>
