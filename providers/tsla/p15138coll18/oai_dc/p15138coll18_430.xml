<dc:title>Issue of the Memphis Commercial Appeal, dated August 7, 1945</dc:title>
<dc:description>Issue of the Commercial Appeal, a newspaper based in Memphis, Tennessee. This issue was published the day after the United States dropped the first nuclear bomb in Hiroshima, Japan. Of special note are the editorial cartoon "No Japan" and the editorial article "Tremendous Power Unleashed," which presents arguments in favor of the United State's use of the atomic bomb for strategic and moral reasons.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The American public and most of the industrial workers on the Manhattan Project were surprised by the news of the development and use of the atomic bomb when it was announced on August 6, 1945. In addition to releasing information on the attack, the federal government also prepared press releases on atomic energy and the sites of the Manhattan Project. For many Tennesseans, especially those in the Middle and Western divisions, these reports were the first time that they had ever heard of Clinton Engineer Works and the "secret city" of Oak Ridge, which they were also surprised to learn was the fifth largest city in their state.</dc:description>
