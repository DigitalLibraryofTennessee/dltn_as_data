<dc:description>Jack Knox was a noted conservative political cartoonist. He became the staff cartoonist for the Evening Tennessean in 1933. He moved a year later to The Memphis Commercial Appeal where he worked for 11 years before finally joining The Nashville Banner in 1946. Mr. Knox retired in 1975 after 29 years with The Banner. Reverend James Lawson was a divinity student at Vanderbilt University and a leader in the "passive resistance movement." Critics referred to him as an "agent of strife."  He was dismissed from the university because of his espousal of civil disobedience. John Kasper was an outspoken segregationist who was convicted in 1957 of inciting people to riot in Nashville, Tennessee. He also spoke out publicly against the decision to integrate Clinton High School, in Clinton, Tennessee.</dc:description>
