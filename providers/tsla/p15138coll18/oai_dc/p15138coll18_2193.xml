<dc:title>TVA Agricultural Extension, showing methods to limit mosquito breeding</dc:title>
<dc:description>This photograph shows an aircraft spraying insecticide in the swampy areas to help control the breeding areas of mosquitos.</dc:description>
<dc:description>When the Tennessee Valley Authority was incorporated in 1933, malaria affected a third of the population in the region. Death records kept by the Tennessee Valley counties indicated that mosquito borne diseases like malaria and yellow fever took an enormous toll in human life before TVA launched its mosquito-control programs. TVA's response to fighting these diseases was controlling water levels and applying insecticides to help reduce the mosquito breeding sites.</dc:description>
