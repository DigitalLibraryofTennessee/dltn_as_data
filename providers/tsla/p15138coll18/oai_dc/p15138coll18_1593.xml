<dc:title>Letter from Gov. Hill McAlister to President Roosevelt requesting aid from the PWA</dc:title>
<dc:description>Gov. Hill McAlister requests an allocation of funds from the Public Works Administration to build National Guard armories in Tennessee.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Public Works Administration (PWA) was one of the first of the New Deal "alphabet agencies" intended to alleviate the effects of the Depression. It was created as part of the National Industrial Recovery Act in 1933. In cooperation with state, county, and city governments, the PWA spent $4 billion constructing 70 percent of the nation's new educational buildings; 65 percent of its new courthouses, city halls, and sewage plants; 35 percent of its new public health facilities; and 10 percent of all new bridges, roads, and subways.</dc:description>
