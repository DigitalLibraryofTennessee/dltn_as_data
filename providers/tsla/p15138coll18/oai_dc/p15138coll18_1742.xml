<dc:title>Race between the Natchez and the Robert E. Lee steamboats</dc:title>
<dc:description>This postcard depicts a scene of a race between the Natchez and the Robert E. Lee steamboats that took place in June of 1870. The race was from New Orleans up the Mississippi River to St. Louis.</dc:description>
<dc:description>During the 1800s, rivers became an important part of Tennessee's economy with the introduction of the steamboat. As a result of the innovations of Robert Fulton, an American engineer and inventor from Pennsylvania, steamboats became a popular source to transport goods. With the development of the steamboat, goods could travel faster and be more maneuverable than the flatboats people had used previously. Over time, the busy river ports helped cities such as Nashville and Memphis grow and prosper.</dc:description>
