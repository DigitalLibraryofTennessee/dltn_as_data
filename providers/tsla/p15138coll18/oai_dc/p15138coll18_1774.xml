<dc:title>Letter from T. C. Ashcroft to Governor Rye</dc:title>
<dc:description>Cashcroft, Mayor of Memphis, writes the governor, informing him that W.L. Mitchell, office of Factory Inspector, was in Memphis in the interest of a local strike that was causing trouble to Cashcroft. Cashcroft stated, "I desire to suggest that it would be well if the Factory Inspector were kept in Nashville, where he could attend to his duties and not be allowed to stir up trouble here."</dc:description>
<dc:description>A strike is a work stoppage caused by the mass refusal of employees to work, usually in response to employee grievances. Strikes are sometimes used to pressure governments to change policies.</dc:description>
