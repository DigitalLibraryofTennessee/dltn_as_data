<dc:title>Daniel Boone (1734-1820) shown sitting on a cliff edge, holding a rifle. This image depicts his first sighting of Kentucky.</dc:title>
<dc:description>A grayscale plate made from a copy of Sulley's 1774 portrait, apparently torn out of a book, with a lengthy legend below the image and handwritten notes pencilled in above and below.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Daniel Boone was the most famous and influential of the "long hunters" who explored the western reaches of the Virginia and North Carolina colonies prior to the Revolutionary War. These areas became the states of Tennessee and Kentucky in the 1790s. Boone's most famous exploit was to pioneer a route through the Appalachian mountain ranges of eastern Tennessee and southeastern Kentucky that became known as "the wilderness road." This route ran west from Virginia just below the northern border of Tennessee until it reached the Cumberland Gap, where it turned turned north to pass through the Gap into Kentucky. This road was the principal route used by settlers migrating from Virginia and the Middle Atlantic states into the "Bluegrass" areas of Kentucky. The plate shown was used as an illustration for an article on Boone that appeared in the Register of the Kentucky Historical Society, May, 1907 (V. 5, No. 14, p. 38). According to the legend on the page, this portrait of Boone was originally painted by artist Thomas Sulley during Boone's 1774 visit to the colonial Virginia capital at Richmond. The colonial governor of Virginia, Lord Dunmore, had invited Boone to the city to consult on ways to improve the Wilderness Road and thereby encourage more colonists to settle in the undeveloped western lands of the Virginia colony. The attribution of the painting to Thomas Sully is erroneous, as that artist was not born until 1783.</dc:description>
