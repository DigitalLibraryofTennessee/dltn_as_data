<dc:title>2nd Tennessee Infantry</dc:title>
<dc:description>2nd Tennessee Infantry at Camp Fornance in Columbia, South Carolina</dc:description>
<dc:description>In all, Tennessee contributed four regiments (more than 4,200 men) to the Spanish-American War. Just one, the First Tennessee Infantry, saw combat, and that was in the Philippine Insurrection. The First Tennessee was disbanded in November 1899, but almost a third of its men joined the 37th U.S. Infantry, which became popularly known as the "Tennessee Brigade." The Second Tennessee, raised mostly from men in West Tennessee, trained for war but never saw combat. They were discharged in February 1899.</dc:description>
