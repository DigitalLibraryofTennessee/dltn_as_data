<dc:title>Ladies and Lynchings</dc:title>
<dc:description>This four page pamphlet discusses why women formed the Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching and why they stood against lynching, specifically the lynching of blacks by white men. From 1921-1930, 211 lynchings were conducted. After the Association was founded in 1930, 21 lynchings took place that year. This pamphlet also gives lynching statistics through 1938 which saw the lowest number of lynchings until that time. This work argues against the common myth that lynchings were conducted to protect white women. This work also gives examples of how real women were instrumental in preventing lynchings.The publication ends by describing how the Association was working with law enforcement to sign a pledge to educate against lynchings and prevent mob action.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Jim Crow Laws were policies and regulations regarding segregation of African Americans in the United States from the Reconstruction Era through the 1960s. Jim Crow laws dictated segregation in all aspects of life, including transportation, housing, entertainment, and access to things such as water fountains and entryways to buildings. Jim Crow was mainly prevalent in the Southern states, but was also found in some Northern states. The landmark Supreme Court case of Plessy v. Ferguson in 1892 resulted in the legal mandate of "separate but equal," a main tenant of Jim Crow. Although Jim Crow laws were very restrictive, African Americans were further persecuted by groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and other hate groups. Often, African Americans were lynched as a form of "justice" for alleged crimes. Lynchings were violent occurrences that often became town spectacles that citizens would attend much like a performance.</dc:description>
