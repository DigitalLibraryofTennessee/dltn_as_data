<dc:title>Letter from administrator Prentiss M. Brown to the members of War Price and Ration Boards in Tennessee</dc:title>
<dc:description>This letter from Prentiss Brown, administrator of the Office of Price Administration, commends the members of local War Price and Ration Boards for their untiring effort, excellent judgement, and ability to adjust national policy to local conditions. He states that without their efforts, ""we would long ago have failed in our efforts to control inflation and to maintain the fair distribution of scarce commodities.""</dc:description>
<dc:description>During World War II, Americans were frequently called upon to salvage raw materials for the war effort. Tennessee created the Tennessee State Defense Council to cooperate with the federal government on its National Defense Program. One of its activities was to aid in the rationing of products. Many counties in Tennessee also created rationing boards. Robert Boyte Crawford Howell served as the chairman of the War Price and Rationing Board in Davidson County from 1942-1945 during the World War II era.</dc:description>
