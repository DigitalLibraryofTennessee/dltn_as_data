<dc:description>The State of Franklin movement was a short attempt at the creation of a new state in the trans-Appalachian settlement of present-day East Tennessee. After North Carolina passed an act to cede its western lands to Congress in 1784, leaders in the trans-Appalachian region held a convention in Jonesborough to vote on statehood and to draft a new constitution. John Sevier was elected governor in 1785. Sevier faced opposition from an anti-Franklin faction in the region, led by John Tipton. The opposition grew and the movement for statehood slowly dissipated. By 1789, the Franklin movement had ended and John Sevier was appointed brigadier general of militia for Washington County.</dc:description>
