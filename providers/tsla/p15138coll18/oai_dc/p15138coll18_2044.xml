<dc:title>Letter from Lewis Ross to John Ross regarding the options for Cherokee removal</dc:title>
<dc:description>In this 2-page letter, Lewis Ross writes his brother, Cherokee Chief John Ross, about the options for the removal of the Cherokee Tribe. He states that given the circumstances, he fears there is nothing his brother will be able to do in Washington but to negotiate the terms of removal. He states that there are only two options presented to the people - either to stay and be forced off their lands under the terms of the false treaty or to negotiate their own terms that could be more satisfactory to the Nation. He suggests that they should negotiate for more time to remove, their own control of the money, and to be allowed to remove to where they choose. He goes on to say they will likely receive nothing more from the United States Government than more oppression as long as they are within the limits of the country and perhaps they could find a different country in which to settle. He knows the people place high expectations and pressure on his brother and they are all waiting in suspense for the news from him.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the American government continually pressed the Cherokee Nation to cede their ancestral lands and remove to lands west of the Mississippi River. The Cherokee Council, led by Chief John Ross, ardently opposed the idea of removal. However, in 1835, a minority group of Cherokees supporting removal negotiated with the United States without the approval of the Cherokee Council. This fraudulent treaty, which became known as the Treaty of New Echota, ceded all Cherokee lands to the United States and allotted two years for the voluntary relocation of the Tribe. The Cherokee Council made several attempts to renegotiate an approved treaty over the following two-year period when the enforced removal began in 1838.</dc:description>
