<dc:description>Governor of Tennessee, 1891-1893. The nomination and subsequent election of John Price Buchanan as Governor was the high-water mark for agrarian politics in Tennessee. Buchanan beat out Jere Baxter and Josiah Patterson for the Democratic nomination, then defeated Republican Lewis Baxter in the general election. Though unable to secure the nomination again in 1892, he stuck to his agrarian principles, running independently and earning the support of the Populists.</dc:description>
