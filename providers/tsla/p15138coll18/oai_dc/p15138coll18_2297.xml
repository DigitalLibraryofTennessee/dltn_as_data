<dc:title>Postal Telegraph message from the United States Marine Corps giving Mary Washington Frazer her orders</dc:title>
<dc:description>This telegram is from G. G. Wheeler, of the United States Marine Corps, to Mary Frazer, ordering her to report immediately to the Nashville Courthouse to be sworn in to Officer Candidate School of the U.S. Marine Corps Women's Reserve. The message gives her the name of the officer to whom she is to report. The original address to which the telegram was to be sent is marked out and replaced with the forwarding information of "James Robertson Hotel" in handwriting.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Mary Washington Frazer was living in the James Robertson Hotel temporarily with her family while they prepared to move into their new house in Belle Meade. Frazer volunteered to join the Marine Corps in 1943 and received her orders to report in June of that year. Frazer remained in the Marine Corps until her discharge in May of 1946.</dc:description>
