<dc:title>Weekend violence brings guards and peace: gatherings banned, traffic re-routed in moves to bring order, Kasper seeks to make bond after he gets one year for violating order</dc:title>
<dc:description>This article describes the National Guard involvement in the town of Clinton, mainly during Labor Day weekend in 1956. Beginning with a recap of the events leading up to the National Guard being sent to Clinton, this article gives details about the National Guard's role in keeping order in the town. This article also discusses the aftermath of the rioting that occured on Labor Day weekend, both in the town itself and at the school. This title feature of this article, however, refers to a short blurb about John Kasper and his court sentence of one year for violating a court order prohibiting interference with the integration of Clinton High School.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Clinton High School, located in Clinton, Tennessee in Anderson County, was the first school in the state to be integrated in 1956 following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education. There were twelve African-American students who enrolled in the school in the fall of 1956, and they became known as the "Clinton 12." During the integration in the fall of 1956, Clinton was the site of anti-integration riots and protests, including the involvement of notorious white supremacist John Kasper. After the violence escalated on September 1, the National Guard was called into Clinton to keep the peace and protect citizens.</dc:description>
