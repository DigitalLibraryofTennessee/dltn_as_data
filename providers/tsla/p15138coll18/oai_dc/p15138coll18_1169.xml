<dc:description>World War II was the catalyst that brought change in the gender roles held for women. Because of the labor shortage produced by men joining the armed forces during World War II, women were encouraged to takes jobs in nearly every industry. Traditional gender roles had limited the job descriptions of women, but the need for manpower during the war allowed women to extend the boundaries of the work they could perform outside the home.</dc:description>
