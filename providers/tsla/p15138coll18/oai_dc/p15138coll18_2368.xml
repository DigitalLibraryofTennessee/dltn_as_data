<dc:title>Waiting for the Finish </dc:title>
<dc:description>This political cartoon shows a badly injured German Emperor Wilhelm II, who has been run over by a car driven by Uncle Sam and an unidentifed man. The car is labeled "3rd Liberty Loan." The emperor is saying "Isn't nature wonderful! Think of all the pretty little blossoms, and oh, the music of the birds, and the stripes on zebras and the speckles on the potatoe bug-and-!!" Next to the emperor is an injured dachshund with a question mark over its head, an overturned basket of eggs, and a sheet of paper with the words "Peace Proposals" written on it. Another fast-moving car, next to a piece of paper that says "4th Liberty Loan" is preparing to run over the emperor.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Liberty loans, or liberty bonds, were war bonds created by U.S. Secretary of the Treasury William Gibbs McAdoo. They were sold in the United States to boost patriotism and support the Allied powers during World War I. Bonds were sold to the public in different amounts as loans, which the U.S. government agreed to repay in full with interest in a specified number of years. There were four Liberty Loan Bond issues and one post-war Victory Bond issue. Altogether, these bonds raised about 21 billion dollars. The Old Hickory Powder Plant in Old Hickory, Tenn. near Nashville was a large smokeless powder plant opened by DuPont Engineering Company in 1918. The powder produced at the plant could be used for firearms and artillery. Though plant construction was not completed by the time the Armistice was signed, five of the six powder units were operational and produced 501,000 pounds of powder a day.</dc:description>
