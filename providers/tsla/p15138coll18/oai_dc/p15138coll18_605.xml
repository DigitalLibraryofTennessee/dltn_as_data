<dc:title>Letter to Governor Prentice Cooper from Thomas T. Crenshaw</dc:title>
<dc:description>Letter dated July 14, 1943 to Governor Prentice Cooper from Lieutenant Colonel Thomas T. Crenshaw, Corps of Engineers, Clinton Engineer Works, Manhattan District. This correspondence demonstrates tensions between states and the federal government during World War II. In this letter, Crenshaw references an incident in which Governor Cooper is reported to have angrily torn up President Roosevelt's Public Proclamation No. 2 that designated Clinton Engineer Works as total exclusion area no longer under state control.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Prior to the construction of Oak Ridge, the federal government issued notices to occupants of the Black Oak Ridge area of Anderson and Roane Counties that required them to evacuate their property. Governor Cooper had not been consulted before these notices were issued and had received reports from local citizens that the government was evicting them from their homes and undercompensating them for their property. Cooper had also heard that the federal government had not compensated the counties for the cost of building the roads and bridges for Oak Ridge. All of these factors created tension between the state and federal governments.</dc:description>
