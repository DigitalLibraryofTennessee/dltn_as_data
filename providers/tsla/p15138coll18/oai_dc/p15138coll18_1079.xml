<dc:title>Mexican war muster rolls</dc:title>
<dc:description>These militia muster rolls from the Mexican- American War list the names of Tennessee men who enlisted in the militia. When President Polk asked the state of Tennessee to muster 2,800 soldiers for the war, around 30,000 men volunteered to fight. The militia ultimately had to implement a lottery system for volunteering and raised five regiments. This overwhelming support for the war effort cemented Tennessee's nickname the 'Volunteer State'.   </dc:description>
<dc:description>The Mexican- American War lasted for a year and a half, from spring of 1846 through the fall of 1847. Mexican military forces invaded southern Texas, which had recently been annexed into the United States, in the spring of 1846 in an attempt to reclaim some of their former territory. President Polk responded by asking Congress to declare war and appointed General Winfield Scott to command the U.S. troops. U.S. forces eventually defeated the Mexican troops and Mexico signed a treaty giving the California Territory to the United States.</dc:description>
