<dc:title>Letter to Governor Tom C. Rye from Anne Dallas Dudley, Tennessee Equal Suffrage Association</dc:title>
<dc:description>Letter dated February 9, 1917 to Governor Tom C. Rye from Anne Dallas Dudley, President of the Tennessee Equal Suffrage Association. Dudley offers the services of 25,000 Tennessee women to participate in war work and fill jobs left open by drafted men.</dc:description>
<dc:description>After the Selective Service Act of 1917 was passed, many American men were drafted into military service during World War I. Drafts and the need for war supplies led to labor shortages, which gave women the opportunity to apply for jobs in places they would have been denied employment before the war, such as munitions factories. American women also volunteered on the homefront and overseas in organizations like the Red Cross and the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA). Anne Dallas Dudley was a national and state leader in the fight for women's suffrage who worked tirelessly to secure the ratification of the 19th Amendment in Tennessee.</dc:description>
