<dc:title>World War I era canning operation</dc:title>
<dc:description>This photograph shows a group of women carrying out an operation to can corn, tomatoes, green beans, and more in Oakland, Fayette County, Tennessee. They appear to be canning as part of a 4-H Club, as the cans have the ""4H Brand"" label. The women are dressed similarly, wearing white hats and aprons.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The National Food Administration encouraged Americans to grow and preserve greater amounts of food during the World War I era. The goal was for food consumption on the home front to decrease so that the surplus food production could be used to feed American soldiers overseas. This mobilization took place through home demonstration agencies, which networked with land-grant colleges all across the South. In Tennessee, this mobilization took place through the University of Tennessee County Extension Service agents. The UT Extension Service sponsored local 4-H programs which taught several domestic skills to Tennesseans at home.</dc:description>
