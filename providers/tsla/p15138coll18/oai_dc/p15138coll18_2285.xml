<dc:description>Because of the volume of soldiers needed on the front lines during World War II, the United States government allowed women to fill non-combatant positions in the military in order to release as many men as possible for fighting. Every branch of the military incorporated women into their ranks in some fashion. The United States Marine Corps Women's Reserve (MCWR) were authorized in July, 1942, when the Navy created its women's reserve, Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES). However, the MCWR was not formed until February of 1943. The Marine Corps was the only WWII women's reserve unit to use the same training curriculum for both men and women, modified only enough to account for differences in gender. At the end of WWII, most of the women who had enlisted were discharged and expected to return to traditional feminine roles. However, small numbers of women remained a part of each branch and were able to continue their military careers. The MCWR was made a permanent part of the U.S. Marine Corps in 1948 with the Armed Forces Integration Act.</dc:description>
