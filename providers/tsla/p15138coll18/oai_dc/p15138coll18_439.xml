<dc:title>Issue of The Knoxville News-Sentinel, dated August 6, 1945</dc:title>
<dc:description>Issue of the Knoxville News-Sentinel, a newspaper based in Knoxville, Tennessee. This issue was published on the day that the United States dropped the first nuclear bomb in Hiroshima, Japan. Of special note is the headline article, "Atomic Super-Bomb, Made at Oak Ridge, Strikes Japan," which describes the detonation of the "Little Boy" atomic bomb in Hiroshima and the development of the nuclear weapon by the Manhattan Project and Clinton Engineer Works.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The American public and most of the industrial workers on the Manhattan Project were surprised by the news of the development and use of the atomic bomb when it was announced. In addition to releasing information on the attack, the federal government also prepared press releases on atomic energy and the sites of the Manhattan Project. While many in East Tennessee had heard of the mysterious Oak Ridge, even those employed by the Clinton Engineer Works knew only what their positions required them to know.</dc:description>
