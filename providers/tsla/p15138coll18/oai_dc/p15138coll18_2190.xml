<dc:title>Boat passing through the lock, Pickwick Dam, Tennessee</dc:title>
<dc:description>This postcard shows the lock at Pickwick Dam that was created as part of the Tennessee Valley Authority project in the 1930s and 1940s.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Pickwick Dam is located in Hardin County. Construction at Pickwick began on March 8, 1935 and the lake formation began three years later on February 8, 1938. Pickwick Landing Dam rises 113 feet and is 7,715 feet long. Similarly to other TVA projects, the construction of Pickwick Dam affected the lives of five hundred families in Tennessee and northern Alabama and Mississippi. Many of the property owners and tenants in the area were displaced. </dc:description>
