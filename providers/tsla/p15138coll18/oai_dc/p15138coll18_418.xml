<dc:title>T.E.C. Bulletin, Monday, August 27, 1945</dc:title>
<dc:description>Issue of the T.E.C. Bulletin, a restricted, interoffice newsletter of the Tennessee Eastman Corporation during its wartime operation as part of the Manhattan Project. Of special note are the "Whereishima?" joke and the "Kill that Rumor" cartoon found on page three. These features are representative of the culture of the city of Oak Ridge and other parts of the United States where propaganda devices, such as posters, were prevalent.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This issue of the T.E.C. Bulletin was published about two weeks after Emperor Hirohito announced Japan's surrender to the Japanese over the radio. Despite hopes that this declaration would lead to the official end of World War II, security remained tight at Oak Ridge and concerns about espionage increased. This official publication expresses positive opinions and patriotic attitudes toward the use of the atomic bomb.</dc:description>
