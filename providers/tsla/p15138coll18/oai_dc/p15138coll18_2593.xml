<dc:title>Letter to John V. Wright from Frances O. Smith regarding the RMS Lusitania</dc:title>
<dc:description>Letter dated May 9, 1915 to John V. Wright from his presumed neighbor and landlord, Frances O. Smith. This letter describes Smith's observations of the war in Europe, relief movements in the United States, and the American public's reaction to the sinking of Lusitania and the impact of the event on the American governent. Smith states that she is "down on war," but doesn't believe her patience will continue if "war provocation" increases.</dc:description>
<dc:description>In 1915, Europe was in the middle of the first World War. At the time, many Americans, including President Woodrow Wilson were hesitant to enter the war, preferring to enact a policy of neutrality and isolation. As war intensified, German submarine attacks on Allied naval vessels increased, making ocean travel more dangerous for passengers. In April 1915, the Imperial German Embassy placed warning advertisements in American newspapers warning American travelers of possible destruction of ships traveling in the war zone. On May 7 1915, the Lusitania crossed in front of the German U-boat, U-20. The U-boat fired a torpedo into the starboard bow of the liner, which caused an explosion in the ship's hull. The ship quickly began sinking and was submerged within 18 minutes of the attack. Crewmembers attempted to launch lifeboats, but the conditions made it difficult and only 6 of the 48 lifeboats were launched. Due largely to hypothermia and drowning, 1,198 of the 1,962 passengers perished including 128 Americans. The loss of American lives to Germany submarine warfare caused an outcry of anger from American citizens.</dc:description>
