<dc:description>Because of the volume of soldiers needed on the front lines during World War II, the United States government allowed women to fill non-combatant positions in the military in order to release as many men as possible for fighting. Every branch of the military incorporated women into their ranks in some fashion.Stars and Stripes was a daily periodical published by the U.S. Armed Forces for military personnel stationed in the European Theater of Operations. The Women's Army Corps was the only women's military branch, aside from the Army and Navy Nurse Corps, to station women outside of the U.S. or U.S. controlled territories.  </dc:description>
