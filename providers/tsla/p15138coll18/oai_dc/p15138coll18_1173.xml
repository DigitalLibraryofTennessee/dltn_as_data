<dc:title>Interview with Margaret Sanders about victory gardens and shortages during World War II</dc:title>
<dc:description>Video interview of Margaret Sanders by Susan Gordon of the Tennessee Historical Society. In this clip, Gordon asks Sanders if she knew anyone who planted a victory garden during World War II. Sanders states that she did and that as a member of the board of the Nashville Council of Garden Clubs, she got permission from the Board of Education to use the kitchens in the Nashville public schools to set up classes where local gardeners could come to the public schools and learn how to can and preserve food. Sanders speculates there were about twenty-two million victory gardens across the United States during the war and the techniques were different then for preserving food than they are now.</dc:description>
<dc:description>In the 1990s, the Tennessee Historical Society recorded oral histories of Tennesseans who had served in the armed forces, volunteered in civilian services, or worked in war industries during World War II. Margaret Sanders was born in 1900 and joined the Motor Corps in Nashville during World War I. During World War II, she joined the Red Cross because she wanted to help people. </dc:description>
