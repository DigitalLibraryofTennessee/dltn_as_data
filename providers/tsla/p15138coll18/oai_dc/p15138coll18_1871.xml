<dc:title>Letter from Archibald Roane to Henry Deerborn, U.S. Secretary of War.</dc:title>
<dc:description>In this letter, Governor Archibald Roane alerts the Secretary of War of problems with bandits along the Natchez Trace. He expresses the urgent need to catch the perpetrators in order to protect the settlers traveling along the road. He says that it is unclear whether the bandits are primarily Indian or white. Roane worries that the bandits may put the treaties at risk if the settlers attack Indians out of fear, jeopardizing the treaties made between the United States and the various tribes.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Archibald Roane served as Attorney General of the Southwest Territory in the 1790s. He then served as the third governor of Tennessee. In the late 1700s, territorial clashes between white settlers and American Indians including the Cherokees and Chickasaws led to a hostile and often violent environment between the two groups. Several series of treaties between the United States government and tribal governments were signed in an attempt to establish boundary lines and prevent further violence. The Natchez Trace consisted of over 500 miles of Indian territories, including areas owned by the Cherokee and Chickasaw nations.Natchez was a well-known commercial road and essential in the development and settlement of present-day Tennessee.</dc:description>
