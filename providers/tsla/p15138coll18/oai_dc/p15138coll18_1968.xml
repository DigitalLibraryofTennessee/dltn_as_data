<dc:description>After the Selective Service Act of 1917 and the Immigration Act of 1917 were passed, there was a labor shortage caused by the draft that could not be filled by white women and immigrants alone. The increasing demand for materials during World War I provided southern African Americans the opportunity to transition from sharecropping to work in industries previously closed to them, such as manufacturing. Many southern African Americans moved to the North to pursue these opportunities in a movement known as the Great Migration, but some were able to find jobs in the South. The Old Hickory Powder Plant in Old Hickory, Tenn. near Nashville was a large smokeless powder plant opened by DuPont Engineering Company in 1918. The powder produced at the plant could be used for firearms and artillery. Though plant construction was not completed by the time the Armistice was signed, five of the six powder units were operational and produced 501,000 pounds of powder a day.</dc:description>
