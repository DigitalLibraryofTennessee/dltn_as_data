<dc:title>1891 Senate Bill 241</dc:title>
<dc:description>The Bureau of Labor Statistics was created by Senate Bill 241, which became Public Chapter 157 of the 1891 Public Acts. The Bureau was also known as the Bureau of Labor, Statistics and Mines, and incorporated the Office of Inspector of Mines which had been created by Chapter 247 of the Public Acts of 1887.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The primary responsibility of the Bureau was to inspect quarterly all mines, collieries, mills, and factories where human life may be endangered. In case of serious accident, the mine, colliery, or factory owner had to report the incident to the Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Statistics. The Commissioner was also responsible for collecting, arranging and presenting labor statistics to the Governor and General Assembly. The institution of of the Bureau of Labor Statistics is an example of how the state government was beginning to regulate industry in Tennessee.</dc:description>
