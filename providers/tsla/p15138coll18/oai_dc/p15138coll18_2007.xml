<dc:title>Letter from the Davidson County Woman's Christian Temperance Union to Governor Thomas C. Rye</dc:title>
<dc:description>This one page letter, from the ladies of the Davidson County branch of the Tennessee Woman's Christian Temperance Union, discusses the lynching of a black man that presumably occurred in Davidson County. While this letter does not give particular names, it states that the ladies were 'positively shocked at the double murder of two innocent men, and yet more so at the ghastly and horrible punishment meted out by white men to a negro brute' who was the alleged murderer. This letter shows the perspective of women involved in the Christian Temperance Union and their strong hatred of liquor which permeates this letter. Of the African American man who was the alleged murderer, the Union wrote that he was "probably crazed by bootlegger's liquor [and] knew not what he was doing when he committed the dastardly crime." The letter goes on to offer Governor Rye sympathy and prayers as he is faced with the hard problem of race relations and the lynching problem.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Jim Crow Laws were policies and regulations regarding segregation of African Americans in the United States from the Reconstruction Era through the 1960s. Jim Crow laws dictated segregation in all aspects of life, including transportation, housing, entertainment, and access to things such as water fountains and entryways to buildings. Jim Crow was mainly prevalent in the Southern states, but was also found in some Northern states. The landmark Supreme Court case of Plessy v. Ferguson in 1892 resulted in the legal mandate of "separate but equal," a main tenant of Jim Crow. Although Jim Crow laws were very restrictive, African Americans were further persecuted by groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and other hate groups. Often, African Americans were lynched as a form of "justice" for alleged crimes. Lynchings were violent occurrences that often became town spectacles that citizens would attend much like a performance.</dc:description>
