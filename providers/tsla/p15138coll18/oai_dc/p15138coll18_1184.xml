<dc:title>A shift change at the AVCO Aerostructures plant in Nashville, Tennessee</dc:title>
<dc:description>This picture shows a group of employees leaving the Avco Aerostructures plant in Nashville (Tenn.) after a shift change. In the center of the picture, two women can be seen among the employees. Although this picture is dated 1952, Avco was hiring women to work in their plants much earlier, during the labor shortage of World War II. </dc:description>
<dc:description>World War II was the catalyst that brought change in the gender roles held for women. Because of the labor shortage produced by men joining the armed forces during World War II, women were encouraged to takes jobs in nearly every industry. Traditional gender roles had limited the job descriptions of women, but the need for manpower during the war allowed women to extend the boundaries of the work they could perform outside the home.</dc:description>
