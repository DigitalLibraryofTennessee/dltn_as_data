<dc:title>Jimmy Polk of Tennessee</dc:title>
<dc:description>This is a folk song about the presidential election of 1844, in which the darkhorse Democratic candidate James K. Polk defeated more established Whig candidate Henry Clay. The song humorously speaks against Polk with lyrics like "Ha! Ha! Such a nominee as Jimmy Polk of Tennessee" and "They poked it to the cunning elf by poking Jimmy Polk himself." This song was likely propoganda written and circulated by Polk's political opponents in the election. These types of propoganda materials, like music sheets, were widely popular because they were so easy to spread to the public.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The presidential election of 1844 had a surprise outcome. Dark horse nominee James K. Polk, the little known former governor of Tennessee, ran on the popular promise of territory expansion. He grouped a conflict with Great Britian over the Oregon Territory with the annexation of the Republic of Texas. By promising to incorrporate these territories into the United States, Polk transcended fractions within the Decomcratic Party and defeated the much better known Whig candidate Henry Clay, as well as former president Martin Van Buren.</dc:description>
