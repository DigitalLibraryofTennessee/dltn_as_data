<dc:description>The U.S. Food Administration sought to supply American and Allied troops with food supplies during World War I by instituting voluntary rationing initiatives. Herbert Hoover, the director of this administration, worked to inspire Americans to ration by disseminating posters, articles, workshops, and other materials that taught Americans food substitution and discouraged waste. He also implemented voluntary Meatless Mondays and Wheatless Wednesdays to conserve needed supplies.</dc:description>
