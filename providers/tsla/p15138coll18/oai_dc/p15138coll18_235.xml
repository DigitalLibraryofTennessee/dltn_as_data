<dc:title>DeSoto at the Mississippi -The Review</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photographic reproduction of a sepia drawing or painting, showing Hernando DeSoto and members of his army confronting a large armada of Native American war vessels on the Mississippi River, at a point traditionally held to be just south of modern-day Memphis, Tennessee.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The provenance of the item illustrated is not indicated. Hernando De Soto (c.1500 - 1542) was a veteran of the Spanish Conquest of Peru.  In 1539 he landed in Florida with an army of some 600 men to conquer the lands of the American Southeast.  Over the next three years his expedition wandered as far north as North Carolina and eastern Tennessee, and as far west as Oklahoma.  In 1541 De Soto's expedition reached the Mississippi River at a site just south of modern-day Memphis, where it encountered the Native American fleet represented in the image. This drawing or painting, attributed to V. Perard, pictorializes Spanish accounts that the earliest European expedition into present-day Tennessee encountered Native American societies that were well-organized and capabile of fielding formidable military forces.  </dc:description>
