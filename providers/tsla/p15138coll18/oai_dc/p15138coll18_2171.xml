<dc:description>For his contemporaries, David Crockett (1786-1836) served as a latter-day embodiment of a way of life associated with the long hunters of the 18th century. His success as a politician (he served two terms in the Tennessee General Assembly and three in the U.S. House of Representatives) was in large part due to his ability to captivate audiences with humorous tales of his hunting adventures in the great forest that still covered much of Tennessee in the 1830s. The image shown, the cover illustration of the 1840 Crockett Almanac, printed in Boston four years after Crockett's death at the Alamo, is an example of the self-depricating humor that endeared Crockett to his fellow Americans.The Crockett Almanacs were examples of the "comic almanac," a type of humorous publication filled with tall tales, exaggerated descriptions of frontier "characters," and woodcut illustrations depicting dramatic or ridiculous situations. The first Crockett Almanac was published in Nashville in 1835. Between 1835 and 1856, some fifty-five editions were published in a variety of locations. Almost nothing is known about the writers, illustrators, or publishers of the first four editions, the "Nashville imprints" of 1835-1838. Subsequent editions were printed in northern cities such as Boston and Philadelphia. Modern historians assert that Crockett himself had no connection with these publications, and that neither he nor his heirs earned any money from them.</dc:description>
