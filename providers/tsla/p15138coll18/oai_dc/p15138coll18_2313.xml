<dc:title>Letter from Mary Washington Frazer to her parents regarding the end of World War II and lift of gas ration</dc:title>
<dc:description>In her letter, Mary Frazer refers to her mother's birthday and says she attempted to call the previous night. She expresses disbelief that the war is finally over and wonders when she will be discharged. She states that she heard on the radio that one can go to the gas station and fill up their car without a ration coupon. She admits she was unable to fill without coupons the previous day, but later states that she had interrupted her letter writing to go to the station to get gas.</dc:description>
<dc:description>During World War II, Mary Washington Frazer was commissioned as an officer in the United States Marine Corps Women's Reserve. After completing her training courses, she was assigned positions at Quantico Marine Base in Virginia as well as Camp Lejeune in New River, North Carolina. After the war ended, Frazer remained in service for almost a year before being discharged. Because many of the resources needed for the war industry were in limited supply, many products were rationed during World War II, including gasoline. Civilians were given ration books that contain a small number of coupons for a limited amount of rationed products.</dc:description>
