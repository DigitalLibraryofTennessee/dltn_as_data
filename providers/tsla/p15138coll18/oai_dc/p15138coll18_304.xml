<dc:title>The Clinton Pile, also known as the X-10 Pile and the X-10 Graphite Reactor</dc:title>
<dc:description>This photograph shows the X-10 Pile at Oak Ridge, a graphite-moderated nuclear reactor used to create plutonium-239 from uranium-238 and the neutrons emitted in the fission of uranium-235. On the back of the photo is written: Basic materials for Abbott Laboratories' radiopharmaceuticals are produced in this giant nuclear reactor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.</dc:description>
<dc:description>X-10 was the World War II code name for Clinton Laboratories, which is now Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The X-10 reactor served as a model for the construction of a larger plutonium production plant in Hanford, Washington, which created the plutonium used in the "Fat Man" atomic bomb detonated over Nagasaki. Here, the reactor is shown being used for one of its peacetime activities before its deactivation in 1963.</dc:description>
