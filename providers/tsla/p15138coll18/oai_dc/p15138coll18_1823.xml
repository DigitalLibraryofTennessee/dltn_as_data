<dc:title>1911 Senate Bill 867</dc:title>
<dc:description>This act forbids the employment of children under fourteen years of age, but permits the employment of children from fourteen to sixteen under certain conditions, which were modified and extended in 1917 House Bill 997, which became Public Act 77.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Tennessee, which in 1890 had nearly seventy thousand working children between the ages of 10-15, was one of the first states in the country to pass legislation putting restrictions on the use of child labor. In 1893, Governor Peter Turney signed into law House Bill 6, which made it illegal to employ children under the age of twelve in "work-shops, mines, mills, or factories in this State." In 1901, House Bill 545 raised the minimum age to fourteen. During this time and into the early 1900s, an argument to counter child labor was education. Parties against child labor pushed for and attained compulsory education legislation. The education legislation affected the development of child labor laws. In 1911, a caveate was added to previous legislation that, in addition to a minimum age requirement of 14, children from the ages of 14 to 16 were permitted to work as long as they maintained obtained permission from their county school superintendent. This ensured that children at least through the age of 16 were being educated and kept the majority of child under that age out of the workforce. However, the field of agriculture, in which the vast majority of the state's working children were employed, was not covered by either law.</dc:description>
