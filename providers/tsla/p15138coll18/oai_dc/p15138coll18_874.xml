<dc:description>"Stax Records: The Dream That Died," The Commercial Appeal, Memphis, TN. First in a series of three articles. This first article gives a detailed history of the start and development of Stax Records from 1960, up to its legal dispute with CBS, Inc. in the mid-1970s. The article talks about the Memphis Sound and the gradual development of the Soul sound from rhythm and blues. It touches on the popularization of black music in the 1960s and 70s.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Stax Records was a major catalyst in the creation of Southern and Memphis soul music. Founded in 1957 by two white siblings and business partners, Jim Stewart and Estelle Axton (STewart/AXton = Stax), the label was renowned for its output of African-American music and integrated bands. It had a racially integrated team of staff and artists, at that time unprecedented both in Memphis and the South.</dc:description>
