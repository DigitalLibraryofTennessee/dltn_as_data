<dc:description>Men are shown with tools and machinery in the finishing department at the Sparta Spoke Factory</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Sparta Spoke Factory was established on the Calfkiller River in 1896. It became the world's largest producer of wooden spokes. As the need for wooden spokes decreased, focus shifted to making other hardwood components. The company is still in business today as Sparta WoodWorks, which manufactures custom furniture components and specialty products.</dc:description>
