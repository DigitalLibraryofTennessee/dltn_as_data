<dc:title>Excerpts from Jane Washington's log of slave clothing and other plantation property</dc:title>
<dc:description>This log book, written by Jane Washington, wife of plantation owner George A. Washington, lists the names of slaves on the plantation by gender and size of clothing. The sizes seem to be generalized. Some types of clothing are ordered three times a year, usually in May, September and December. Others are ordered every other year or every three years. When a slave child is born, it is noted that the child receives all clothing. This log book contains information outside of slave clothing, however. It also includes a list of which slaves live together and the food they need, and lists of other plantation inventory, including: flower seeds, books, china, silver, cloth, portraits, alcohol, box candy, personal clothing, and clothing for some of her children (Martha, Mary, Bessie, Lucy and Joe).</dc:description>
