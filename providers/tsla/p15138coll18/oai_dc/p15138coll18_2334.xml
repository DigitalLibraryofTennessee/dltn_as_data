<dc:title>Broadside published by the Tennessee Anti-Saloon League</dc:title>
<dc:description>With the headline of "Nashville Police Force Pronounced Inadequate", this broadside is critical of the Nashville police force and their handling of enforcement of the prohibition amendment. The broadside provides sixteen incidents that the Tennessee Anti-Saloon League has determined are examples of the police force's inefficiency. The broadside also implicates Nashville mayor Hilary Howse as a supporter of police chief Smith and quotes him as saying "I am with Chief Smith to the Limit." </dc:description>
<dc:description>The Prohibition movement was organized in the middle of the 19th century as part of a religious movement. As its popularity increased, several states banned consumption of alcohol. The 18th Amendment (passed 1917, ratified 1919) and the Volstead Act (passed 1920) both supplemented the movement, attempting to ban all alcohol in the United States. The 21st Amendment repealed the Prohibition laws in 1933. </dc:description>
