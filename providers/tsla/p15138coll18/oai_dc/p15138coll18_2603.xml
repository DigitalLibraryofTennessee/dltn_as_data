<dc:description>The League of Nations was an international organization that was a result of the Paris Peace Conference at the end of World War I. It was a precursor to the United Nations. President Woodrow Wilson was a fierce supporter and advocate of the intergovernmental organization, but the United States Senate failed to approve American entry into the League promoted by a wave of disapproval from the American public. The League of Nations dissolved at the end of World War II when the United Nations was formed. The League to Enforce Peace was a similar organization created in 1915 in Philadelphia. The mission of the League to Enforce Peace was to campaign for an international organization for peace. Former president William Howard Taft served as the president for the League to Enforce Peace.</dc:description>
