<dc:title>Letter to Mrs. W.D. Freeman from Louis L. Allen</dc:title>
<dc:description>Louis L. Allen, Chief of the Labor Department of State and an Inspector of Workshops and Factories, tells Mrs. Freeman that her son Walter, though only a few months shy of 14 years old, cannot yet legally work despite her request for a permit. This is just one of several examples of letters written to the governor about obtaining work permits for underage children.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Letters to the governor such as this one are indicative of the need for children to work to help support their family, despite the legal age minimum. In the response, the governor refers to 1911 Public Act 57, which prohibits the employment of children under the age of 14.</dc:description>
