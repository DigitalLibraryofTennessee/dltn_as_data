<dc:title>Our Colored Heroes</dc:title>
<dc:description>This color lithograph illustrates the heroic fight waged by African American World War I soldiers Sergeant Henry Johnson and Private Needham Roberts on May 15, 1918 when they were attacked on guard duty in a French sector by a vastly superior German raiding party. Though both Johnson and Roberts sustained numerous wounds, they prevailed in a struggle that ended up in the hand-to-hand combat conveyed in this print.  These soldiers were cited for bravery and were the first Americans to receive the illustrious French Croix de Guerre.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Henry Johnson and Needham Roberts were members of the 369th Infantry, which came to be known as the Harlem Hellfighters and one of the most well known African American units of the war. The American military was segregated during World War I, with black soldiers prohibited from fighting alongside white soldiers. African American soldiers readily joined the military with the hope that their service would lead to better treatment at home. Most African Americans served in labor positions, the 369th Infantry, however, became part of the 93rd Division and then was attached to the French Army. In the summer of 2017, the 369th Infantry was integrated into the French 161st Division. Once combat operations began for the 369th, they distinguished themselves by spending over six months in combat and becoming the first to reach the Rhine. Henry Johnson and Needham Roberts were the first Americans to receive the Croix de Guerre.   </dc:description>
