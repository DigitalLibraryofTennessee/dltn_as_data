<dc:title>Aerial view of TVA's Cherokee Dam</dc:title>
<dc:description>This photograph shows an aerial view of Cherokee Dam that was created as part of the Tennessee Valley Authority project in the 1930s and 1940s.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Cherokee Dam is located on the Holston River on the boundary between Jefferson and Hamblen counties. As part of the Tennessee Valley Authority's wartime readiness program, the dam was built in a mere two years, with much of the work taking place around the clock. As a result of wartime concerns and budgetary restraints, recreational facilties were not created. However, during the 1960s, local, state and TVA officials eventually created Panther Creek State Park on the east side of the river to boost tourism and economic growth to the area. The Cherokee Dam is 175 feet high and 2,060 feet long.</dc:description>
