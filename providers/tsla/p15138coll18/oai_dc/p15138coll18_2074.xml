<dc:title>Letter from John Ross and Cherokee Council to Governor McMinn in reply to a proposition for total cession of Cherokee lands</dc:title>
<dc:description>This 3-page letter to Tennessee Governor Joseph McMinn was written by Chief John Ross and the Cherokee Council for publication in the Raleigh Register. In the letter, the Council states they have reviewed with close attention the proposal for a total cession of their ancestral lands east of the Mississippi River to the United States. The letter goes on to list several provisions in the latest treaty for a census of Cherokee people to be taken. They question why the treaty was not closed on the date provided by the treaty and acknowledge their desire for the Cherokee people to be allowed the choice to remove or to stay on their ancestral lands. They reject any proposal for total cession and desire the last treaty be closed as agreed.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the American government continually pressed the Cherokee Nation to cede their ancestral lands and remove to lands west of the Mississippi River. The Cherokee Council, led by Chief John Ross, ardently opposed the idea of removal.</dc:description>
