<dc:title>Fireman M. R. Mahaffey enters Navy to make it family affair</dc:title>
<dc:description>Newspaper clipping that announces the enlistment of Mr. Mahaffey and his daughter, Mrs. McClendon, in the Navy during World War II. The article states they are joining Mahaffey's two sons and son-in-law who are already in the military. The accompanying picture shows Mahaffey and his daughter at their local recruiting station. Mrs. McClendon is holding a recruiting poster for the WAVES (Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service), the women's reserve unit for the Navy. </dc:description>
<dc:description>Because of the volume of soldiers needed on the front lines during World War II, the United States government allowed women to fill non-combatant positions in the military in order to release as many men as possible for fighting. Every branch of the military incorporated women into their ranks in some fashion.</dc:description>
