<dc:description>In 1865, Congress created the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, known more commonly as the Freedmen's Bureau to offer assistance to newly emancipated slaves. Leaders within the Freedmen's Bureau considered education a key to the future; advancement of ex-slaves and established a number of freedmen's schools. Freedmen of all ages flocked to cramped buildings to learn basic reading, writing, and mathematical skills.</dc:description>
