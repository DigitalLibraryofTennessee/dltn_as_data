<dc:title>Extract from the Articles of Agreement between the Cherokee Nation and the United States</dc:title>
<dc:description>This is a re-written excerpt from a contract between the Cherokee Nation and the United States. In this contract, the leaders of the Cherokee Nation discuss the terms and conditions of the construction of a road through Cherokee territory. The contract states that the Cherokee will own houses of entertainment along the road as well as three ferries. Cattle is not allowed on the road in order to protect the Cherokee livestock. Additionally, the Cherokee will be in charge of the road's maintenance and will require Cherokee representation during the marking of the road by American surveyors.</dc:description>
<dc:description>In the late 1700s, territorial clashes between white settlers and American Indians including the Cherokees and Chickasaws led to a hostile and often violent environment between the two groups. Several series of treaties between the United States government and tribal governments were signed in an attempt to establish boundary lines and prevent further violence.</dc:description>
