<dc:description>Anne Porterfield was a notable journalist who served as the editor of the Southern Woman's Magazine and wrote or edited for the Knoxville Journal, Nashville American, Nashville Banner, and Tennessean. During World War I, she was on the verge of going to France to work for the YMCA as a canteen worker when the fighting ceased, thereby ending the need for canteen workers. Rankin also participated in Red Cross work, making bandages in the evenings, and served as a war worker in the powder plant in Old Hickory, Tennessee, during World War I. After the Selective Service Act of 1917 was passed, many American men were drafted into military service during World War I. Drafts and the need for war supplies led to labor shortages , which allowed women to apply for jobs in places they would have been denied employment before the war, such as munitions factories. American women also volunteered on the homefront and overseas in organizations like the Red Cross and the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA).</dc:description>
