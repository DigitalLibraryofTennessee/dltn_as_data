<dc:description>The Textile Conference (Oct. 15-16, 1907) called by Governor Patterson resulted in several resolutions. The employment of any child under 14 years of age in any manufactory or mercantile establishment was prohibited. They adopted a 60-hour per week schedule of all women and children under 18 years of age, with a provision that as soon as possible a 58-hour schedule would be adopted. It was established that a child under 16 years of age in any manufacturing establishment between the hours of 7 pm and 6 am was prohibited. A compulsory education law for all children between the ages of 7 and 15 years was adopted. The conference attendees also demanded punishment under the vagrancy laws of any able-bodied men who live in idleness upon the wages or earnings of their mother, wife or minor children.</dc:description>
