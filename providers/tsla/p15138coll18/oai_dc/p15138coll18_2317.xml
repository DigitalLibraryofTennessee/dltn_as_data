<dc:title>Letter from Mary Washington Frazer to her parents quoting a comical rhyme</dc:title>
<dc:description>Mary Frazer begins this letter by comments on the news she received about her brother, Preston. Then she copies a "jingle" she saw on a co-worker's desk that described how she believes everyone will feel by the end of the war. The rhyme discusses wishing one was a rock so as to be lazy and do nothing, and Mary comments that she feels that way a lot. She states that she does not see how men can sustain a working schedule all their lives. She closes with a question regarding her nephew.
