<dc:description>In the 1920s, many American homes began to have electricity for the first time. With the introduction of electricity, many products began to be developed that saved people time from their housework and chores. As a result, many people began to eagerly purchase these new electrical appliances in the hopes of having more leisure time. To encourage rural people to want to have electricity in their homes, many electric power companies held demonstrations and offered promotional booklets that illustrated the benefits of having electricity on the farm.</dc:description>
