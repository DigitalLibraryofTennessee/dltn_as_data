<dc:title>Shell gorget, Memphis, Tenn.</dc:title>
<dc:description>A black-and-white photograph of a shell ornament.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The subject of the photograph is a gorget (a small plate or ornament suspended from the neck and worn over the chest) crafted from shell.  The Tennessee Division of Archaeology has identified the shell as coming from a lightning whelk, a type of ocean shellfish found along the Gulf  and Florida Coasts.  The shell was most likely transported intact from that area to Middle Tennessee, where the outer whorl of the shell was fashioned into a "Cox style" ornament.   Archaeologists believe that Cox-style gorgets were produced during the Mississippian period,, and these artifacts are believed to have been created between A.D. 1250-1450.  The presence of marine shell in Tennessee is evidence of the wide extent of Native American trade networks operating during the Mississippian period. </dc:description>
