<dc:title>Lee S. Greene interview with Buford Lewallen</dc:title>
<dc:description>This interview was conducted by Lee S. Greene in the process of writing his book, ""Lead Me on: Frank Goad Clement and Tennessee Politics."" This interview with Buford Lewallen, son of W.E. Lewallen (the mayor of Clinton at the time of the desegregation of the high school), highlights his father's involvement in the Clinton High School desegregation. Lewallen specifically discusses the change in violence among the Clinton town members.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Clinton High School, located in Clinton, Tennessee in Anderson County, was the first school in the state to be integrated in 1956 following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education. There were twelve African-American students who enrolled in the school in the fall of 1956, and they became known as the ""Clinton 12."" During the integration in the fall of 1956, Clinton was the site of anti-integration riots and protests, including the involvement of notorious white supremacist John Kasper. After the violence escalated on September 1, the National Guard was called into Clinton to keep the peace and protect citizens.</dc:description>
