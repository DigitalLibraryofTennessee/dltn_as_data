<dc:description>The Office of Price Administration (OPA) was a New Deal agency created in 1941 to: (1) stabilize prices and rents, (2) prevent profiteering and hoarding, (3) protect citizens with fixed incomes from lower living standards, and (4) to encourage production. The war in Europe and in the Pacific caused many shortages on the home front, and rationing was a way to fairly distribute commodities and products. During this time the government asked citizens to sacrifice certain luxuries and necessities, so the OPA established a system of rationing that affected things most Americans took for granted. That meant scarcities of tires, cars, bicycles, stoves, gasoline, sugar, dairy, coffee, meat, cooking fat, bobby pins, shoes, zippers, nylon stockings, tin foil, and many other items. Tokens were used as a form of currency. Unfortunately, the black market thrived on the illegal resale of ration and token books. </dc:description>
