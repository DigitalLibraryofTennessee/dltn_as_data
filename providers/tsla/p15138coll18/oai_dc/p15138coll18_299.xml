<dc:title>Interview of George Parker describing a competition between women workers and physicists</dc:title>
<dc:description>Interview of George Parker, nuclear chemist on Manhattan Project in Oak Ridge conducted by Ann Toplovich of the Tennessee Historical Society at his home at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. In this interview, Parker describes the role of local women from East Tennessee who were employed as technicians at Oak Ridge.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Due to labor shortages on the homefront in the United States, women filled many of the growing number of production jobs left open by the military's draft of young men. Parker's anecdote about the production competition between the women employed at Y-12 and the University of California physicists who challenged them displays common attitudes toward women and people from the American South at this time.</dc:description>
