<dc:description>Henrietta Hickman Morgan was born in 1917 in Gallatin, Tennessee. The daughter of Davidson County Judge Litton Hickman, she attended Ward-Belmont Preparatory School and Vanderbilt University. At Vanderbilt she was a member of Kappa Alpha Theta sorority and Phi Beta Kappa honorary scholastic fraternity, and she was one of the first women to be editor of The Masquerader, the university's humor magazine. Morgan was also a member of the Junior League, the Girls Cotillion Club, the Nashville Query Club, and the Nashville Red Cross Motor Corps, of which she was captain. She graduated from Vanderbilt in 1938. In September 1942, Morgan volunteered for service with the WAVES and received her naval training at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. Appointed a midshipman in November 1942, she was commissioned an ensign the following month. She was among 50 students selected from a class of 900 for early graduation. Upon reporting for duty in Washington the day after receiving her commission, she became an aide to the director of convoy and routing. She was promoted to lieutenant, junior grade, in February 1944. Lieut. Morgan was hospitalized at Bethesda Naval Hospital on July 20, 1944, with an undisclosed illness. She died April 27, 1945, shortly before the end of the war.</dc:description>
