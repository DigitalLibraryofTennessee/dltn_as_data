<dc:title>Negroes reject biracial group's suggestions</dc:title>
<dc:description>A newspaper article from The Nashville Tennessean dated April 10, 1960, found on page one and page six-A, column three. Negroes reject the biracial committee's partial integration proposal and decide to resume demonstrations. In separate statements, both students and merchants express their objections to the committee's proposal. The article includes a photograph of Diane Nash, a Fisk University student and chairman of the student protest group and the Reverend Kelly Smith, pastor of the First Baptist Church and president of the Nashville Christian Leadership council.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Diane Nash was born May 15, 1938 in Chicago, Illinois. She attended Howard University in Washington, D.C. and later transferred to Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee. A vocal leader of civil rights and anti-war movements, particularly from 1959 to 1967, she was a strong supporter of the non-violent protest philosophy. She was instrumental in organizing the Freedom Rides and the 1963 March on Washington. Nash returned to Chicago in 1965 where, as an educator and lecturer, she continues to be a passionate and prominent voice for political and social change.</dc:description>
