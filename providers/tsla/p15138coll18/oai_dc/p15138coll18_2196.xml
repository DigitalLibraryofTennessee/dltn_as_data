<dc:description>Big Ridge State Park was one of five demonstration parks developed by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in cooperation with the National Park Service and the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) as an example of public recreation development along TVA lakeshores. The structures at Big Ridge State Park reflect the craftsmanship and stonework of the CCC. Today, visitors to the park can do a variety of recreational activities such as hiking, camping, and swimming.</dc:description>
