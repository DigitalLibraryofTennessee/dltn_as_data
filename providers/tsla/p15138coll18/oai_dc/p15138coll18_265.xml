<dc:title>Yellow terror</dc:title>
<dc:description>This article appeared in 1956 in the Nashville Tennessean Magazine. Written by reporter Louise Davis, it tells the story of the yellow fever epidemic of 1878 in Memphis, Tennessee. It provides statistics about how many were infected and how many died among both the African American and white populations in Memphis, discusses the physicians who came to the city to provide assistance, and explains why no one thought to suspect mosquitos were spreading the disease.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Yellow Fever devastated the city of Memphis in the 1870s. In 1873, 2,000 were killed by the disease. When the disease returned in late July 1878, 25,000 residents fled the city. Between August and October of 1878, the disease killed more than 5,000 people. Towns along the railroads leading out of Memphis also experienced significant losses due to the epidemic. Yellow Fever caused fever, chills, hemorrhaging, severe pain, a yellowing of the skin, and vomit that was black in color.</dc:description>
