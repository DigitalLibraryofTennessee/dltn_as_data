<dc:title>Anti Nullification, a letter from Andrew Jackson on the subject</dc:title>
<dc:description>This newspaper article is a transcription of a letter written by Andrew Jackson to William B. Lewis on the topic of nullification. In the letter, Jackson responds to Lewis's concerns over the tariff issue threatening the unity of the republic. By using examples from other southern states who do not support nullification, Jackson provides reasons why he believes that the states will not disband from the union despite the controversy over high tariffs.  </dc:description>
<dc:description>During the presidency of Andrew Jackson, one of the issues he faced was the nullification crisis that occurred from 1832 to 1833. The nullification crisis involved a confrontation between the state of South Carolina and the federal government over high tariffs. Many South Carolinians believed that the tariffs implemented by the federal government were unconstitutional and that they had the right to deny or nullify any tariff. Through a series of negotiations and a compromise that lowered the tariff, the nullification crisis with South Carolina and the federal government was adverted.</dc:description>
