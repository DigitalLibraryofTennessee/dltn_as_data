<dc:title>Common Sense newspaper article featuring Highlander Folk School</dc:title>
<dc:description>Front page of "Common Sense", an anti-communist newsletter from 1958-9-15. Main article discusses Highlander Folk School, focusing on a woman from Little Rock (Ark.) named Grace Lorch. The article names her and other attendees of "Communist Training Schools" like Highlander as "communist race mixers". Many supporters of segregation believed that the alternative (desegregation) was a Communist ideal. The front page also mentions Daisy Bates of the Little Rock chapter of the Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), calling her a "chronic troublemaker". </dc:description>
<dc:description>Clipping from the anti-communist newsletter "Common Sense", which was produced by Conde McGinley, his son and daughter-in-law. Initially, the newsletter focused on anti-communism but quickly developed into an anti-semitic publication. McGinley and his publication were investigated by the House Un-American Activities Committee for the spreading of hate propoganda. After McGinley's death, his son continued to publish "Common Sense" until 1972. </dc:description>
