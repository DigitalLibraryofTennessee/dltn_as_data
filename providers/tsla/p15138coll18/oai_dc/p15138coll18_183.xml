<dc:title>Letter from Mrs. Glen Rose Jackson to Gov. Clement regarding segregation</dc:title>
<dc:description>Typed three page letter from Mrs. Glen Rose Jackson to Gov. Clement regarding segregation</dc:description>
<dc:description>Frank G. Clement (1920-1969) was governor of Tennessee from 1953-1959 and 1963-1967. During his three terms as governor, he saw eight amendments added to the Tennessee State Constitution (the first since 1870), campaigned against capital punishment, and was the first Southern governor to veto a segregation bill. His anti-segregation stance did not sit well with most Tennesseans but he stood firm in his beliefs. Clement was known for his old-fashioned, rousing political speeches, which would eventually lead to his departure from politics. Clement died in a car accident in Nashville in 1969.</dc:description>
