<dc:description>Telegram reporting weather conditions in Memphis as well as new cases of yellow fever. </dc:description>
<dc:description>Yellow Fever devastated the city of Memphis in the 1870s. In 1873, 2,000 were killed by the disease. When the disease returned in late July 1878, 25,000 residents fled the city. Between August and October of 1878, the disease killed more than 5,000 people. Towns along the railroads leading out of Memphis also experienced significant losses due to the epidemic. Yellow Fever caused fever, chills, hemorrhaging, severe pain, a yellowing of the skin, and vomit that was black in color.</dc:description>
