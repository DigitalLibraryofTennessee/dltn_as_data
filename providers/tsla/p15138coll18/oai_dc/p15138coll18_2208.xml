<dc:title>Women's Army Corps Information Separation Pamphlet</dc:title>
<dc:description>This small pamphlet was given to women who were being discharged from the Women's Army Corps at the end of World War II. It explains that women who have spent the last few years in the regimented life of the military may find it difficult to readjust to civilian life. It offers tips on how the military or military support organizations, like the American Red Cross, can provide aid to women returning to civilian life. It also advises women on maternity care if they are being discharged because of a pregnancy and suggests women seeking employment contact the United States Employment Service to take advantage of the GI Bill of Rights. It gives information about maintaining the bands they bought while in service. It also reminds women that the skills they learned while serving in the Army can benefit them in the civilian world, thanks them for their service as a soldier and wishes them the best of luck as a civilian.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Because of the volume of soldiers needed on the front lines during World War II, the United States government allowed women to fill non-combatant positions in the military in order to release as many men as possible for fighting. Every branch of the military incorporated women into their ranks in some fashion. The Women's Army Corps was the first women's reserve unit formed during World War II. It was originally created in 1942 as an auxiliary unit, known as the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps. However, when complications arose because of their civilian status in this auxiliary, the unit was changed into a women's reserve of the Army. The Women's Army Corps was the only women's reserve unit, aside from the nursing corps, to station women outside of the United States or U. S. controlled territories of Hawaii and Alaska. At the end of WWII, most of the women who had enlisted were discharged and expected to return to traditional feminine roles as civilians. However, small numbers of women remained a part of each branch and were able to continue their military careers. The Women's Army Corps became a permanent part of the U.S. Army in 1948 with the Armed Forces Integration Act.</dc:description>
