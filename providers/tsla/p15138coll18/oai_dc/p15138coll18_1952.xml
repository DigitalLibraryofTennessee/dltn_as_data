<dc:title>Weapons for Liberty</dc:title>
<dc:description>This poster from World War I shows Columbia dressed in an American flag and holding a golden shield with the seal of the United States of America. A boy dressed in a khaki Boy Scouts of America uniform kneels at her feet and offers her a sword inscribed with the Boy Scouts motto, "Be Prepared." The text of the poster reads, "U*S*A Bonds. Third Liberty Loan Campaign. Boy Scouts of America. Weapons for Liberty."</dc:description>
<dc:description>The patriotic climate in America during World War I inspired many children to volunteer for the war effort. President Woodrow Wilson, Secretary of War Newton D. Baker, and U. S. Food Administrator Herbert Hoover asked Boy Scouts to perform tasks such as collecting Liberty Loan subscriptions, planting war gardens, conducting a census of black walnut trees for gun and airplane manufacturing, collecting fruit pits and nut shells for gas mask filters, and distributing propaganda from the Committee on Public Information.</dc:description>
