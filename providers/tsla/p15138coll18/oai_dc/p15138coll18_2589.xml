<dc:title>A Proclamation by the President of the United States</dc:title>
<dc:description>A proclamation from president Woodrow Wilson that states that Congress has enacted a law that subjects all male subjects between the ages of 21 and 30 to register for the military draft.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The federal government enacted the Selective Service Act on May 18, 1917. The act allowed the government to raise an army for World War I efforts through a system of obligatory enlistment. All American males from the age of 21 to 30 were required to register for the draft. The federal government later expanded the age range to include men from age 18 to 45. More than 61,000 Tennesseans were drafted into service.</dc:description>
