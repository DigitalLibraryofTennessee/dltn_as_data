<dc:title>Copy of Governor Austin Peay's correspondence with Mr. O.L. Hicks, Sheriff of Cocke County</dc:title>
<dc:description>Governor Austin Peay writes to the sheriff of Cocke County, Tennessee, Mr. O.L. Hicks, of a strongly worded letter he received from the Honorable A.M. Stack, a judge in North Carolina, concerning liquor coming into North Carolina from Cocke County. Governor Peay quotes the judge in this letter, "It is openly charged that the officers of that city and county make no effort to suppress bootlegging, and it is even charged that some of the officers are in collusion with the bootleggers." Governor Peay reminds Sheriff Hicks that is is required to enforce criminal laws in his county. Governor Peay goes on to say that he is charged to institute and maintain proceedings against any officer who does not enforce the laws where so charged. </dc:description>
<dc:description>The Prohibition movement was organized in the middle of the 19th century as part of a religious movement. As its popularity increased, several states banned consumption of alcohol. The 18th Amendment (passed 1917, ratified 1919) and the Volstead Act (passed 1920) both supplemented the movement, attempting to ban all alcohol in the United States. The 21st Amendment repealed the Prohibition laws in 1933. </dc:description>
