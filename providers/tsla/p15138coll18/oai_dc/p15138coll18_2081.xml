<dc:title>Letter from John Ross to Tennessee Governor William Carroll regarding the Cherokee Nation's stance on removal</dc:title>
<dc:description>In this 6-page letter, Cherokee Chief John Ross acknowledges that the Cherokee Nation is aware of President Andrew Jackson's desire to remove the Indians to the west. Ross references a previous letter in which a meeting was requested with the Cherokees to discuss a treaty for removal. He plainly states that the Cherokee Nation is not interested in meeting for a discussion because they are convinced there is nothing the United States Government can offer that will change their disposition against removal from their ancestral lands. Ross says that the Executive Department of the Nation is always willing to receive official representatives from the President to discuss various topics. He relays concern about the States being granted jurisdiction over the portion of the Cherokee Nation with each State's territory and believes that whatever decision is made has the potential to benefit or doom the Nation. He ends the letter with the assurance that the Cherokees are the allies of and depend upon the United States, having fought wars with the U.S., and they desire peace with the American people.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the American government continually pressed the Cherokee Nation to cede their ancestral lands and remove to lands west of the Mississippi River. The Cherokee Council, led by Chief John Ross, ardently opposed the idea of removal, though they were willing to maintain alliances with the United States.</dc:description>
