<dc:title>Letter from W. Noyes Carr, Jr. to Col. R.L. Watkins</dc:title>
<dc:description>This letter by W. Noyes Carr, Jr. references the Tennessee State Legislature making preparations to pay volunteers for their trip to Coal Creek to help out during the miner's rebellion against the convict lease program in Tennessee. Mr. Carr, who served in Co. C, Chattanooga Volunteers, expresses frustration over the trip and suggests that the state owes him. He is requesting the gun that he carried and says that his right arm and shoulder has hurt him ever since the trip to Coal Creek.</dc:description>
<dc:description>On July 14, 1891, three hundred miners who worked in the towns of Briceville and Coal Creek in Anderson County, TN congregated and marched to the Tennessee Coal Mining Company&#65533;s stockade outside Briceville. The stockade housed 40 convicted criminals who had been leased to the company by the state to work as convict laborers. These convicts took jobs previously held by local miners. The miners took control of the convicts, marched them to Coal Creek and boarded them on a train bound for Knoxville. This incident began a year-long rebellion aimed at convincing the state to end the convict lease program that began in 1866. Rife with abuse, the convict lease program held convicts that were primarily African American. Prison conditions were deplorable with bad food, poor sanitation, and brutal treatment of inmates. When Governor John P. Buchanan called a special session of the Tennessee State Legislature in August to consider the issue of convict leasing, the legislature resolved to abolish convict leasing once the current contract expired. The miners felt like more could be done. Rebellion continued until the 1893 Tennessee General Assembly passed legislation to construct a new state penitentiary and abolish convict leasing in 1896.</dc:description>
