<dc:title>Article by Fred Travis on tent city resident Mrs. Georgia May Turner</dc:title>
<dc:description>This article draft gives a very personal look at the African Americans affected by the land evictions and living in the "Freedom Village." Travis begins this article by describing Mrs. Georgia May Turner, a 58-year-old woman living in the Tent City, who is described using a hoe to drain the water in front of her tent to the road. Travis describes the tent where she and three of her children live, complete with Turner's refrigerator and stove that are stored outside the tent due to lack of electricity. Travis conjures up a great mental picture of the tents in Tent City. Turner's interview, however, is perhaps more striking. Regarding her former home as a tenant farmer on a white woman's property, Turner says, "I been on that farm just about all my life... I always done what she said. I never disobeyed her, and I ain't holding nothin' agin' her now... However,[l]ast summer I went down an register to vote and she say she seen my pi'ture in the paper. Then she tell me las' fall I got get off her farm, that she don' want me there no mo'."</dc:description>
<dc:description>During the 1950s, the African American citizens of Fayette and Haywood Counties struggled for full voting rights. Although African Americans had the legal right to vote, white citizens of these counties imposed roadblocks to keep blacks from voting. In response to this, African American leaders formed the Fayette County Civic and Welfare League and the Haywood County Civic and Welfare League. In June and July of 1959, these leagues held voter registration drives for African Americans so they could vote in the August Democratic primary. However, African Americans were blocked by whites from voting in the primary. This prompted the Leagues to file a legal suit against the local Democratic Party under the Civil Rights Act of 1957. As a way to penalize African American voters, white citizens of these counties compiled a list of all the registered African American voters and circulated it amongst white merchants, doctors, and other white business people. In response, many African Americans were refused goods, services, and insurance, and some lost employment and credit. Also, in the winter of 1960, many African American tenant farmers were evicted from the land they were living on and forced to move elsewhere. In response to this, several African American property owners allowed ""Tent Cities"" to be erected on their land. ""Tent Cities"" were where several African Americans established tent homes. The residents were sent food and other supplies from supporters from across the country while facing opposition and violence from groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and the White Citizens Council. By 1962, the situation in Fayette and Haywood Counties had been brought to the attention of the United States Government, and the Justice Department ruled that interfering with voting rights, including land discrimination based on voting, was illegal.</dc:description>
