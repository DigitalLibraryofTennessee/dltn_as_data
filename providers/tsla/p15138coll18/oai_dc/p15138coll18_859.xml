<dc:title>Annual address of J.P. Buchanan</dc:title>
<dc:description>Full-page clipping from the Weekly Toiler featuring John P. Buchanan's address to the Tennessee State Alliance in 1889. The speech, replete with flowery historical and religious allusions, presages the imminent merging of Wheel and Alliance into the Farmers' and Laborers' Union.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Tennessee assemblyman and president of the Tennessee Farmers' Alliance, John Price Buchanan would harness agrarian sentiments to capture the Democratic nomination and the governorship of Tennessee in 1890. His administration was unable to pass significant legislation for the cause, and was ultimately derailed by coal miner insurrections over the convict leasing system; nonetheless, he remains the political face of Tennessee's agrarian movement, which would fracture the Democratic party and give way to the Populists.</dc:description>
