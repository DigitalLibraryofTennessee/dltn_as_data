<dc:title>A view of the Chucalissa Indian Village near Memphis, Tennessee</dc:title>
<dc:description>A black-and-white photograph of a recreated Native American flat-topped "temple mound" from the Mississippian period.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Archaelogists believe that the Chucalissa site was occupied by Native Americans of the Mississippian cultural period between 1000 and 1500 C. E. Peoples of this culture lived in communities centered around an elevated "temple mound," such as the one shown, which served as the site for public ceremonies.</dc:description>
