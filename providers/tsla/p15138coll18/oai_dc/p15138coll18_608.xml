<dc:title>Deposition of William Terrell from State of Franklin</dc:title>
<dc:description>This two-sided handwritten document contained on a small slip of paper represents the deposition given before a judge by William Terrel[l] of Washington County concerning a land entry belonging to Jesse Walton in Bumpers Cove. </dc:description>
<dc:description>This document is an example of the one of the extant county records for the State of Franklin.  One reason that the expression "The Lost State of Franklin" seems so fitting is the scarcity of surviving documentaion.  Official documents from the State itself prove the most elusive, and the only printed document is said to be the rejected Houston Constitution from the Greeneville Convention. The survival of county records proved quite uneven.  Some counties, such as Washington and Greene Counties, seem to have quite a bit of documentation to offer.  The parallel operation of North Carolina and State of Franklin courts proved detrimental to the records, for rival county courts clashed, resorted to violence upon occasion, and conducted actual raids to secure court records; all this led to the destruction of records.  The legality of Franklin Acts, marriages,court documents, and Supreme Court decisions was challenged in Tennessee and North Carolina courts over the years and largely recognized and upheld.</dc:description>
