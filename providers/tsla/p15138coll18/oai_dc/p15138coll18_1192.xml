<dc:title>Vultee leads in women workers</dc:title>
<dc:description>Short clipping from the Vultee Volunteer that quotes a report from the New York World Telegram that states Vultee Aircraft was the first aircraft manufacturer to bring women into their plants and claims women are projected to make up 50% of personnel in the aircraft industry by the end of 1942.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Vultee Volunteer was a weekly newsletter published by the Nashville Division of Vultee Aircraft, Inc. for the employees of the plant. Within the issues, the newsletter contains cartoons, articles about the plant and the company, and people of interest. Each issue also commended someone for their efforts to suggest cost-saving changes in production. Because of the labor shortage produced by men joining the armed forces during World War II, women were encouraged to take jobs in nearly every industry and the armed forces. Vultee Aircraft, Inc. was the first aircraft manufacturing company in the nation that hired women to work in the factories. </dc:description>
