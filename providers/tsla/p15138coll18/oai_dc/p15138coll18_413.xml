<dc:title>T.E.C. Bulletin, Monday, August 13, 1945</dc:title>
<dc:description>Issue of the T.E.C. Bulletin, a restricted, interoffice newsletter of the Tennessee Eastman Corporation during its wartime operation as part of the Manhattan Project. Of special note are the two printed letters from Colonel K. D. Nichols, District Engineer of the Manhattan Project. In these letters, he congratulates workers on their contributions to the production of the atomic bomb. These letters also reveal the sense of unease felt during the last days of World War II, as Nichols emphasizes that workers must continue to produce materials for an unknown number of atomic bombs to be dropped on Japan and for future defense purposes during peacetime.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This issue of the T.E.C. Bulletin was published four days after the bombing of Nagasaki. Following the news releases about the Manhattan Project and atomic energy, security measures were tightened, and workers were reminded to be wary of spies.</dc:description>
