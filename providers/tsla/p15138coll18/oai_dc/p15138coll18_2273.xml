<dc:title>Company C, 6th Basic Class, Aviation Ground Officers School, United States Marine Corps graduation party invitation</dc:title>
<dc:description>This graduation party invitation provides all of the information about the time and location of the event in the format of military strategic orders for battle. The invitation begins with the General Situation in which it states that the Company C, 6th Basic Class, AGOS, U.S. Marine Corps has maintained its position for eight weeks and has encountered heavy resistance, including "poison ivy, wood ticks, chiggers...." The General Situation claims there is one last stronghold of opposition remaining, located at Hill BOQ, and states orders have been given to make an assault at nightfall to gain control. The invitation goes on in the Special Situation to recount the Commanding Officers orders and plan for attack, providing the order, time and locations for each event of the "assault." The final section of the invitation lists the Requirement, in which it summarizes the invitation information for the party. The document is typed on the front and back of the invitation. On both the front and back of the invitation the original dates state 26 July 1944 but the 26 has been marked out and 24 is written in place of it.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Because of the volume of soldiers needed on the front lines during World War II, the United States government allowed women to fill non-combatant positions in the military in order to release as many men as possible for fighting. Every branch of the military incorporated women into their ranks in some fashion. The United States Marine Corps Women's Reserve (MCWR) were authorized in July, 1942, when the Navy created its women's reserve, Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES). However, the MCWR was not formed until February of 1943. The Marine Corps was the only WWII women's reserve unit to use the same training curriculum for both men and women, modified only enough to account for differences in gender. At the end of WWII, most of the women who had enlisted were discharged and expected to return to traditional feminine roles. However, small numbers of women remained a part of each branch and were able to continue their military careers. The MCWR was made a permanent part of the U.S. Marine Corps in 1948 with the Armed Forces Integration Act.</dc:description>
