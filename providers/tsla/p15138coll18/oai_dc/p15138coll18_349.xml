<dc:title>Letter from Helen E. Lumpkin to Governor Frank Clement</dc:title>
<dc:description>This letter is from Helen E. Lumpkins, an African American woman living in the north who supports integration. Throughout the letter Lumpkin praises Clement on his actions in Tennessee regarding integration. Lumpkin also emphasizes the need for more actions like those of Clement's to alleviate the tensions between blacks and whites.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Clinton High School, located in Clinton, Tennessee in Anderson County, was the first school in the state to be integrated in 1956 following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education. There were twelve African-American students who enrolled in the school in the fall of 1956, and they became known as the "Clinton 12." During the integration in the fall of 1956, Clinton was the site of anti-integration riots and protests, including the involvement of notorious white supremacist John Kasper. After the violence escalated on September 1, the National Guard was called into Clinton to keep the peace and protect citizens.</dc:description>
