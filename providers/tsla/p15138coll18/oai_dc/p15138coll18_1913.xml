<dc:title>Letter from Governor John Sevier to the warriors of the Cherokee Nation</dc:title>
<dc:description>John Sevier writes to the warriors of the Cherokee Nation requesting their permission to build a road through the Cherokee territitory. The President of the United States is comissioning the road. John Sevier attempts to convince the Cherokees that the road will benefit them more than it will benefit the settlers. Sevier tells the Cherokees that the council in Knoxville is waiting for their opinion on the matter.</dc:description>
<dc:description>John Sevier served as a colonel during the Revolutionary War and led several Tennessee militias into battles against the Cherokee and Chickamagua. By 1798, he was governor of the newly-formed state of Tennessee. In the late 1700s, territorial clashes between white settlers and American Indians including the Cherokees and Chickasaws led to a hostile and often violent environment between the two groups. Several series of treaties between the United States government and tribal governments were signed in an attempt to establish boundary lines and prevent further violence.</dc:description>
