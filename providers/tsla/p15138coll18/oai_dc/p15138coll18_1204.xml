<dc:title>Coffin Handbill</dc:title>
<dc:description>A political advertisement that depicts coffins and is entitled ""Some Accounts of the Bloody Deeds of General Jackson."" The advertisement was distributed during the 1828 presidential election as a negative attack on Andrew Jackson's violent actions over the years.</dc:description>
<dc:description>After losing a close presidential election in 1824, Jackson again ran in 1828 against John Quincy Adams. During this election, Adams conducted a negative campaign against Jackson, depicting him as a military despot who, in the War of 1812, had several militiamen executed and unarmed Indians slaughtered. These so called ""Coffin Handbills"" created by Philadelphia editor John Binns, failed to sway the American public because Jackson ultimately won the bid for the presidency.  </dc:description>
