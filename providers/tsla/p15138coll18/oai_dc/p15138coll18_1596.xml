<dc:title>Photograph of flooding</dc:title>
<dc:description>Photograph of flood sweeping away homes and fields before the flood control provided by TVA. </dc:description>
<dc:description>The photo was probably taken outside Nashville during the historic flood of 1937. The Tennessee National Guard and Works Progress Administration (WPA) contributed to the attempt to protect Nashville and the surrounding areas from flooding. WPA workers built makeshift levees and flood walls, and helped care for refugees. The 105th Observation Squadron (Tennessee National Guard), who took the picture, was re-designated the 105 Airlift Squadron in 1992.</dc:description>
