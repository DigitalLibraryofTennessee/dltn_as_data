<dc:title>Fisk coed tells of day in jail</dc:title>
<dc:description>A newspaper article from The Nashville Tennessean dated April 25, 1960 found on page six quotes Fisk University student and activist, Diane Nash. Nash was one of many students who were in Washington, DC to attend a national conference on the sit-in movement sponsored by the U.S. National Student Association. She was interviewed on "College News Conference," a nationally televised ABC radio-television program.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Diane Nash was born May 15, 1938 in Chicago, Illinois. She attended Howard University in Washington, D.C. and later transferred to Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee. A vocal leader of civil rights and anti-war movements, particularly from 1959 to 1967, she was a strong supporter of the non-violent protest philosophy. She was instrumental in organizing the Freedom Rides and the 1963 March on Washington. Nash returned to Chicago in 1965 where, as an educator and lecturer, she continues to be a passionate and prominent voice for political and social change.</dc:description>
