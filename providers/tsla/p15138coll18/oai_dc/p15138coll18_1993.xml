<dc:title>Post War Problems in the Community, January 1919 by Rutledge Smith</dc:title>
<dc:description>This essay by Rutledge Smith, National Council of Defense Federal Field Secretary for Tennessee, advises Tennesseans on how to maintain sense of community and patriotism after World War I. He presents the United States as a global player whose citizens should concern themselves with providing aid to Europe. Smith also claims that Americans must combat social discontent at home by organizing as a communities through town hall meetings in every school district to discuss social and economic improvements and arrange charitable intiatives. The essay also touches on how to help veterans readjust to civilian life, the environmental impact of war, and the depletion of natural resources used for war work.</dc:description>
