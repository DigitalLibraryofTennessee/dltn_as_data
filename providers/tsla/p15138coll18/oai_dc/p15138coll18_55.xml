<dc:title>Senate Bill No. 11</dc:title>
<dc:description>In 1909, the General Assembly passed a law outlawing the production of alcohol in the state, and Tennessee's distilleries either closed or moved their operations out of state. The ban stayed in effect until 1937, even though National Prohibition was repealed in 1933. Despite the lifting of the state ban, however, distilling operations were allowed in only 3 of Tennessee's 95 counties (Lincoln, Moore, and Coffee).</dc:description>
