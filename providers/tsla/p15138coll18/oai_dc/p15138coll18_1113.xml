<dc:title>Tennessee confederate widow's pension application for Margaret Ann Klinck</dc:title>
<dc:description>Tennessee Confederate Widow's Pension Application for Margaret Ann Klinck, widow of Hayne Irby Klinck of the 15th Tennessee Infantry, CSA. </dc:description>
<dc:description>In 1891, Tennessee established the Board of Pension Examiners to determine if Confederate veterans applying for pensions were eligible. Eligibility requirements included an inability to support oneself, honorable separation from the service, and residence in the state for one year prior to application. Confederate veterans applied to the pension board of the state in which they resided at the time of application, even if this was not the state from which they served. Pensions for widows were first issued in 1905. These applications show place of birth for widow and soldier and information about their children. Proof of marriage was required, so marriage licenses often appear in the supporting papers. </dc:description>
