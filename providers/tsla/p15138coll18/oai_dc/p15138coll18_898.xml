<dc:title>Good Evening</dc:title>
<dc:description>"Good Evening" Column in the Memphis Press Scimitar, talks about RCA-Victor taking musicians and artists from Sun Records; as well as Rugus Thomas' song "The Dog" that is causing a "suggestive" dance craze and its resulting ban from many radio stations</dc:description>
<dc:description>Rufus Thomas recorded many dance-craze songs for the Stax record label. After recording "The Dog," Thomas concentrated on records about animals and dance crazes, with big success coming with songs that combined both, like "Do the Funky Chicken." Dance crazes in the 1950s and 1960s inspired controversy. On the one side, fad dances and songs were banned from some radio airways, and in places like universities and churches because the dances that evolved did not meet certain moral standards. On the other side, dance fads boomed the recording industry and inspired other media outlets to promote shows like American Bandstand.</dc:description>
