<dc:title>Passport to Natchez</dc:title>
<dc:description>A passport permitting a group of people to travel to Natchez. Included on the list of people are "six women, eight children, 18 negroes."</dc:description>
<dc:description>In the late 1700s, territorial clashes between white settlers and American Indians including the Cherokees and Chickasaws led to hostile and often violent environment between the two groups. Several series of treaties between the United States government and tribal governments were signed in an attempt to establish boundary lines and prevent further violence. The Natchez Trace consisted of over 500 miles of Indian territories, including areas owned by the Cherokee and Chickasaw nations. Natchez was a well-known commercial road and essential in the development and settlement of present-day Tennessee.</dc:description>
