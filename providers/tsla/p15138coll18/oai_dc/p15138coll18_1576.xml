<dc:title>Broadside displaying instructions to be observed by pickets and patrols on duty around Memphis</dc:title>
<dc:description>This boadside warns those outside of the picket lines surrounding Memphis of the dangers of entering the city and further spreading the yellow fever. No one from outside of the city is allowed to come in and no one from inside is allowed to leave, unless they have a permit. No household items are allowed to cross the city limits, but provisions and supplies can. Cotton and bales and cotton seed are allowed to cross the border. Anyone who violates these rules put in place by the Superintendent of Quarantine John Johnson will have to pay a fine between fifty or five hundred dollars or serve up to three months in jail. </dc:description>
<dc:description>Yellow Fever devastated the city of Memphis in the 1870s. In 1873, 2,000 were killed by the disease. When the disease returned in late July 1878, 25,000 residents fled the city. Between August and October of 1878, the disease killed more than 5,000 people. Towns along the railroads leading out of Memphis also experienced significant losses due to the epidemic. Yellow Fever caused fever, chills, hemorrhaging, severe pain, a yellowing of the skin, and vomit that was black in color.</dc:description>
