<dc:description>Timothy Demonbreun (1747-1826) was a French Canadian trader who brought goods to French Lick, the original site of Nashville, to exchange for furs and hides with Native American hunting parties. The entrance to the cave was in the face of a limestone bluff overlooking the Cumberland River. It could only be seen from the river, and not from the land above. Tradition holds that Demonbreun used this cave to hide from pursuing Native American warriors. Other, less romantic accounts suggest that Demonbreun used the cave as a ready-made storage space for trade goods until he was able to construct a log dwelling/trading post on land above the bluff. Demonbreun probably first came to the area in the late 1760s, and was staying in the area when the first Anglo-America settlers arrived to found the Cumberland Settlements in the late 1770s. He subsequently served in George Rogers Clark's post-Revolutionary War campaign against the British-allied Native American nations of the Ohio Territory. Demonbreun was readily accepted in Nashville society after he settled there permanently in 1786. The experiences of the American long hunters would have closely mirrored Demonbreun's youthful travels as a fur trader. </dc:description>
