<dc:title>Letter from Jane Addams to Anne Porterfield Rankin</dc:title>
<dc:description>This two-page letter from Jane Addams of Hull House in Chicago to Mrs. Anne Porterfield Rankin of Nashville invites Mrs. Rankin to a gathering of women in Washington, D.C. on January 10th, 1915. This meeting would result in the formation of the Women's Peace Party which was formed in reaction to the start of World War I. Miss Addams states that she "hopes that this meeting may prove to be preliminary to the organization of the women throughout the country in this big movement."</dc:description>
<dc:description>Anne Porterfield Rankin was a prominent Nashvillian who had a talent for journalism and writing. In 1908, she became editor of the Southern Woman's Magazine In January 1915, Jane Addams, Carrie Chapman Catt, and 3,000 other peace activists held a three day conference in Washington, D.C. that brought together women from peace, suffrage, temperance, educational, social work, and patriotic organizations all of which were united in their concern for the outbreak of war in Europe. The conference was called in response to the efforts of Rosika Schwimmer, a Hungarian suffragist and journalist, and Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, a women's activist from England, to convince women in the US to protest the war. At this meeting, the Women's Peace Party was formed. Members of the Women's Peace Party traveled to the Netherlands in April 1915 to participate in the first international women's meeting focused on peace. When the United States entered the war in 1917, the Women's Peace Party remained pacifist, but focused on support for the League of Nations. In 1919, the Women's Peace party joined with the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. </dc:description>
