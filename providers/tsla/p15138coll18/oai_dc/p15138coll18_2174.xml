<dc:title>A description of Thomas "Big Foot" Sharp Spencer</dc:title>
<dc:description>A handwritten, single-paragraph description of the legendary long hunter and settler.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The handwritten account shown is taken from the papers of Judge John Haywood, whose Civil and Political History of the State of Tennessee (1823) is regarded as the first history of our state. Thomas Sharp Spencer was renowned among the early long hunters and settlers of the Cumberland Valley (today's Middle Tennessee) for his size and physical strength. Tradition holds that he acquired the nickname "Big Foot" from his enemies. During the early days of white settlement, Native Americans routinely patrolled the principal trails used by white hunters and settlers to intercept the travelers they regarded as illegal aliens. On one occasion a small group of Native American warriors reportedly picked up Spencer's tracks on a trail and pursued him. When the trail passed through a patch of snow, his pursuers saw the clear imprint of Spencer's very large foot in the snow and gave up the pursuit. A man with a foot so large, they reasoned, would be too large and formidable an enemy. In 1794 Spencer was returning to Middle Tennessee from Virginia when he was shot and killed near the present-day community of Crab Orchard, Tennessee, by a Native American patrol waiting in ambush. Some accounts credit Spencer as the first white to clear land and plant corn in the Cumberland Settlements during an extended (1776-1779) long hunt in the area. As with many other long hunters of this period, including Kasper Mansker, Spencer undertook his travels with the dual purpose of obtaining pelts for sale and finding good land to claim and settle. It was these land claims that would have enabled Spencer, had he survived, to amass the "great fortune" that the Haywood account posits.</dc:description>
