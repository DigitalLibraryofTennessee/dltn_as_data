<dc:title>Aeronautical Map of Manhattan Engineering Districts</dc:title>
<dc:description>Map sent to the Tennessee Civil Aeronautics Administration, which prohibited the flying over of the Oak Ridge area and other former military reservations of the Manhattan Engineer District overseen by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. Issued by U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Washington, D.C. Compiled and printed at Washington D.C. by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. Prohibited area established by Executive Order 9925, dated January 17, 1948. Danger area established by Civil Aeronautics Administration Regulation 604, dated March 1, 1948.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Some of the former sites of the Manhattan Project were repurposed after World War II for continued nuclear research and weapon development by the Atomic Energy Commission. Oak Ridge, Tennessee was the former site of the Clinton Engineer Works that produced most of the u-235 used in the "Little Boy" atomic bomb, which became Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Hanford, Washington was the former site of the Hanford Engineer Works that produced most of the plutonium used in the Trinity site and "Fat Man" atomic bombs, which continued producing plutonium for defense purposes during the Cold War. Los Alamos, New Mexico was the former site of Project Y where top physicists gathered to develop atomic weapons, which became Los Alamos National Laboratory. Salton Sea, California was the site where aeroballistic tests of inert nuclear weapons were conducted during World War II and the Cold War.</dc:description>
