<dc:title>Rules and regulations for the Maryland State Penitentiary</dc:title>
<dc:description>Small booklet describing the new rules and regulations for state penitentiaries in Maryland. Some of these rules relate to improving the health of the prisoners, including having a physician on site at least once a day and requiring that the female prisoners be overseen by a matron. Other rules relate to strengthening the penitentiary's control over the prisoners.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Early prison reformers sought to make prisons more humane and to eliminate harsh and often cruel sentences. Reform started in the north, specifically Pennsylvania, but Tennessee Governor William Carroll sought to model Tennessee's prisons after the reformed prisons elsewhere in the country.</dc:description>
