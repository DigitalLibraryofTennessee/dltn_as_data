<dc:title>Have a Coca-Cola = hail, hail, the gang's all here or how to welcome a WAVE on furlough</dc:title>
<dc:description>A Coca-Cola advertisement featuring four women drinking their sodas together in front of a factory and a train engine. One woman is wearing a U.S. Naval Reserve Women's Reserve (WAVES) uniform and the other three are dressed as war industry workers. The advertisement states that "there's no chummier way" to welcome home friends from military service than by sharing a Coke together. </dc:description>
<dc:description>World War II was the catalyst that brought change in the gender roles held for women. Patriotic characters like Rosie the Riveter and Molly Pitcher were created to inspire women to do their part in the war by getting a job in war industries to replace the men leaving for the battlefront. In addition, because of the volume of soldiers needed on the front lines during World War II, the United States government allowed women to fill non-combatant positions in the military in order to release as many men as possible for fighting. Every branch of the military incorporated women into their ranks in some fashion. Many companies of popular products used this change as an advertising strategy. </dc:description>
