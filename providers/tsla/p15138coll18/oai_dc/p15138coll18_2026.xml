<dc:title>Letter from Elizabeth L. Koen to Governor Thomas C. Rye</dc:title>
<dc:description>This two page letter, from Memphis resident Elizabeth L. Koen, condemns white people that took part in a lynching that included the burning a black man. The opening line of this letter is particularly eye catching: "If a white man should murder a negro woman, and a negro mob should throw the white man's charred head at us-what then!" Koen went on to condemn whites for their violence against blacks and stated that "more is to be expected of white people than black ones." Koen concluded her letter by stating "Any person who believes that all barbarians in this country are black, is color blind." Although this letter certainly has a racist overtone, it also shows the disgust and dismay of some whites at the behavior of lynch mobs.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Jim Crow Laws were policies and regulations regarding segregation of African Americans in the United States from the Reconstruction Era through the 1960s. Jim Crow laws dictated segregation in all aspects of life, including transportation, housing, entertainment, and access to things such as water fountains and entryways to buildings. Jim Crow was mainly prevalent in the Southern states, but was also found in some Northern states. The landmark Supreme Court case of Plessy v. Ferguson in 1892 resulted in the legal mandate of "separate but equal," a main tenant of Jim Crow. Although Jim Crow laws were very restrictive, African Americans were further persecuted by groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and other hate groups. Often, African Americans were lynched as a form of "justice" for alleged crimes. Lynchings were violent occurrences that often became town spectacles that citizens would attend much like a performance.</dc:description>
