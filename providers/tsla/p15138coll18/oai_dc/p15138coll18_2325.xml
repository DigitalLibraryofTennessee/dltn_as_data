<dc:title>Jean Anderson in her Red Cross uniform</dc:title>
<dc:description>This black and white photograph shows Jean Anderson, a family friend of the Frazers, who worked with the Red Cross in Europe during World War II. In the photograph, Anderson is wearing her Red Cross uniform and is sitting on a large rock or wall. In the background, a portion of Oxford University, where Anderson was stationed, can be seen.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Frazer and Anderson families became acquainted while Colonel George Augustine Frazer was stationed in Hawaii in the late 1930s. After the United States entered World War II, Jean Anderson joined the Red Cross and served overseas in the Civilian War Relief department. In one of his letters home from Europe George Preston Frazer wrote to his mother, Sadie, about visiting Jean Anderson at Oxford during his visit to London in February of 1944. Later, Anderson thanked Frazer for his visit. Anderson maintained consistent correspondence with the Frazer framily throughout and after the war.</dc:description>
