<dc:title>The Separate or "Jim Crow" Car Laws or Legislative Enactments of Fourteen Southern States: Together with the Report and Order of the Interstate Commerce Commission to segregate Negro or 'Colored' passengers on railroad trains and in railroad stations</dc:title>
<dc:description>This publication is basically a travel guide for African Americans for train segregation laws in each of the Southern states.The introduction states that this little pocket-sized volume is 'to be a constant companion in the pocket or hand of every self-respecting, law-abiding Negro who is compelled to travel by rail in any of the fourteen states of the Union that have passed separate or "jim crow" car laws for the purpose of humiliating and degrading the Negro race." The Tennessee portion of this little book lists the portion of Tennessee Code and Acts that lay out specific laws regarding segregation on trains to maintain the "separate but equal" ideal.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Jim Crow Laws were policies and regulations regarding segregation of African Americans in the United States from the Reconstruction Era through the 1960s. Jim Crow laws dictated segregation in all aspects of life, including transportation, housing, entertainment, and access to things such as water fountains and entryways to buildings. Jim Crow was mainly prevalent in the Southern states, but was also found in some Northern states. The landmark Supreme Court case of Plessy v. Ferguson in 1892 resulted in the legal mandate of "separate but equal," a main tenant of Jim Crow. Although Jim Crow laws were very restrictive, African Americans were further persecuted by groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and other hate groups. Often, African Americans were lynched as a form of "justice" for alleged crimes. Lynchings were violent occurrences that often became town spectacles that citizens would attend much like a performance.</dc:description>
