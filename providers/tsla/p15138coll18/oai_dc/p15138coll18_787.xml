<dc:title>Populists and Democrats</dc:title>
<dc:description>Letter from E. W. Carmack to James Douglas Anderson regarding national and state political strategies as they relate to the free silver movement. He goes on to excoriate the Populist element of the Democratic party, labeling them "false, treacherous and utterly untrustworthy."</dc:description>
<dc:description>By 1896 the People's Party was losing its momentum as an independent entity, and would soon be assimilated into the Democratic Party. The monetary and anti-monopoly policies it esposed remained key issues in national and state politics for years to come.</dc:description>
