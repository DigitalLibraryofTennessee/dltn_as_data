<dc:description>Letter from J. Frank Shoemaker, Manager of the Cortrim Lumber Company to Governor Hill McAllister regarding the child labor amendment to the U.S. Constitution. He writes that "...the greatest heritage left him by his parents is hte fact he was taught to work when a boy."  He goes on to say that "...this law...would simply be inviting our boys and girls to show a disrexpect to the laws of our country..."</dc:description>
<dc:description>In 1938, President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Fair Labor Standards Act, which, in part, restricted the employment and abuse of child workers. The Act restricted children under age 16 from working during school hours. Prior ot the Act, many employers preferred hiring children because they were usually cheaper, more manageable, and less likely to strike.</dc:description>
