<dc:title>Circular to the Cherokee Nation encouraging voluntary removal</dc:title>
<dc:description>This type-printed circular was written by General John E. Wool and states that it has been a year since he came to the Cherokee Nation with the announcement regarding the treaty for removal and expresses disappointment that the Nation did not listen to him. He reminds them that they have one more year before the time designated by the treaty for relocating before military force will be used to remove those who remain east of the Mississippi. He questions why they would wait or why they would desire to stay and live a life oppressed by the encroaching white men. He encourages them to settle their affairs and prepare to voluntarily remove before May 23rd, 1838, so they can take advantage of both the provisions and protection he is able to provide until the time of military enforced removal.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the American government continually pressed the Cherokee Nation to cede their ancestral lands and remove to lands west of the Mississippi River. President Andrew Jackson, often referring to himself as a father or brother to the Native Americans, believed the best hope for the survival of the Native American tribes was removal and signed the Indian Removal Act of 1830 which authorized the U. S. Government to negotiate with the Native American tribes treaties for the cession of lands and removal west. The Cherokee Council, led by Chief John Ross, ardently opposed the idea of removal. However, in 1835, a minority group of Cherokees supporting removal negotiated with the United States without the approval of the Cherokee Council. This fradulent treaty, which became known as the Treaty of New Echota, ceded all Cherokee lands to the United States and alloted two years for the voluntary relocation of the Tribe. The Cherokee Council made several attempts to renegotiate an approved treaty over the following two-year period when the enforced removal began in 1838.</dc:description>
