<dc:title>Letter from Benjamin Harrison to the Cherokee chiefs and warriors</dc:title>
<dc:description>Typescript copy of a letter from the governor of Virginia, Benjamin Harrison, to Cherokee chiefs and warriors. In the letter, Harrison remarks about the danger of trusting the "people over the great water," in which, he is referring to the British. He also requests that the Cherokee bring their Chickamauga brothers over to the side of the Americans. Harrison also indirectly mentions Nancy Ward, the Beloved Woman of the Cherokees.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Nancy Ward was the last Beloved Woman of the Cherokees. As a Beloved Woman, Ward held a higher status in Cherokee society, which allowed her to contribute and participate in treaties and tribal government. In 1781, she called for peace between Indians and settlers at the Treaty of Holston. At the Treaty of Hopewell in 1785, Ward made another plea for peace.</dc:description>
