<dc:title>America depends on the farmer!</dc:title>
<dc:description>This World War II era poster, created by the Agricultural Extension Service at the University of Tennessee, delivers a message that in order for America to succeed in the war, the farmer must do his part. The poster features an image of a farmer and his family carrying a bushel of produce and ""A Farmer's Wartime Creed."" The creed includes statements reflective of the war-time attitude toward rationing, efficiency, and support of community.</dc:description>
