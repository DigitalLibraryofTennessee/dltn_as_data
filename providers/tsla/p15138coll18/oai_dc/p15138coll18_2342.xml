<dc:description>The February 25, 1867 act mentioned in the document refers to an act passed by the Tennessee General Assembly to give African American men the right to vote and established the criteria for voting eligibility. This law, along with an act passed on May 3, 1866, set forth qualifications and placed significant power in the hands of the commissioners of registration who were appointed by the governor. The commissioner of registration for a given county had the final say on an applicant's eligibility to vote. </dc:description>
