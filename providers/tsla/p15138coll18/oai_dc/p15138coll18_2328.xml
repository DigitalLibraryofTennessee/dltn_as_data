<dc:title>Women... Our wounded need your care</dc:title>
<dc:description>This World War II recruiting poster for the Women's Army Corps features a woman in a knee-length blue uniform dress carrying a covered tray of medical supplies. Behind her are metal-framed hospital beds. The poster encourages women to enlist in hospital companies to perform Army hospital duties. In smaller print it states that women can be assigned to other fields within the Women's Army Corps. It also gives application information.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Because of the volume of soldiers needed on the front lines during World War II, the United States government allowed women to fill non-combatant positions in the military in order to release as many men as possible for fighting. Every branch of the military incorporated women into their ranks in some fashion. The Women's Army Corps was the first women's reserve unit formed during World War II. It was originally created in 1942 as an auxiliary unit, known as the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps. However, when complications arose because of their civilian status in this auxiliary, the unit was changed into a women's reserve of the Army. The Women's Army Corps was the only women's reserve unit, aside from the nursing corps, to station women outside of the United States or U. S. controlled territories of Hawaii and Alaska. At the end of WWII, most of the women who had enlisted were discharged and expected to return to traditional feminine roles as civilians. However, small numbers of women remained a part of each branch and were able to continue their military careers. The Women's Army Corps became a permanent part of the U.S. Army in 1948 with the Armed Forces Integration Act.</dc:description>
