<dc:title>Letter from O.K. Jones, Secretary and Treasurer of the Sweetwater Hosiery Mills to Governor Hill McAlister</dc:title>
<dc:description>Letter from O.K. Jones, Secretary and Treasurer of the Sweetwater Hosiery Mills to Governor Hill McAlister regarding the regulation of labor for persons under 18 years of age. He writes of his experience going to work at the age of 16 and emphatically states that "there has been no exploiting of Child Labor in the South." </dc:description>
<dc:description>In 1938, President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Fair Labor Standards Act, which, in part, restricted the employment and abuse of child workers. The Act restricted children under age 16 from working during school hours. Prior ot the Act, many employers preferred hiring children because they were usually cheaper, more manageable, and less likely to strike.</dc:description>
