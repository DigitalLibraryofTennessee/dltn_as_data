<dc:title>Tennessee secession election returns from Wilson County</dc:title>
<dc:description>Sherriff McCulloch of Wilson County submitted this notice to Governor Isham Harris certifying the results of the election held June 8, 1861 to confirm Tennessee's declaration of independence. According to the report, 2,298 residents voted for "no separation" while 2,329 residents voted for "separation." The numbers for and against representation reflect the interest in providing representation to the government of the Confederate States of America. </dc:description>
<dc:description>In January 1861, Governor Isham Harris convened a special session of the Tennessee General Assembly. There, he requested a popular referendum to decide whether to convene a special state convention to consider Tennessee's federal relations. Secessionists and Unionists argued their sides. Held on February 9th, Tennesseans rejected the proposal for a special state convention. By the spring of 1861, circumstances were changing. Governor Harris calls another special session of the Tennessee General Assembly, asking legislators to adopt a declaration of indpendence. On May 6, the legislators voted by large margin to declare Tennessee's independence, but stipulated that their decision be put to a public referendum to be held on June 8th. Tennesseans voted 69 to 31 percent to support independence and secede from the Union. </dc:description>
