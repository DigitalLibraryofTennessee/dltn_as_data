<dc:title>Veteran survey for Carmene Jordan</dc:title>
<dc:description>WWII veteran survey submitted by Carmene Jordan who served in the Army as a dietitian. In her answers, Jordan gives many details about her responsibilities as the dietitian for everyone residing at Camp Forrest (Tenn.) during World War II, including prisoners of war from Europe and displaced Japanese-Americans. She also describes her rights and benefits as the same as the members of the Army Nurse Corps. Jordan also recalls witnessing wounded soldiers returning from the battlefield and their attitudes regarding their injuries. Jordan was also asked to become a dietitian at David Lipscomb College (now Lipscomb University) because a former patient recommended her. Along with her survey, Jordan submitted a photograph and detailed list of her job responsibilities.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Because of the volume of soldiers needed on the front lines during World War II, the United States government allowed women to fill non-combatant positions in the military in order to release as many men as possible for fighting. Every branch of the military incorporated women into their ranks in some fashion. In 1996, in an effort to expand its holdings about World War II, the Tennessee State Library and Archives sent surveys to WWII veterans from or currently living in Tennessee. Over 7000 veterans, or family members of veterans, returned completed questionnaries, often submitting additional supplemental materials, such as photographs, with their surveys. </dc:description>
