<dc:title>Letter to Samuel Houston sbout establishing a state library in Tennessee</dc:title>
<dc:description>This letter to Governor Samuel Houston from Sam Brown in Philadelphia regards a proposal by Brown's partner Letrell to establish a state library in Tennessee, and in every other state in the Union. Brown expresses his confidence that Houston will be in support of the library because of his liberal support of the Nashville University in the past.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Samuel Houston served as Tennessee's governor for less than two years before he resigned. After resigning, he chose to live among the Cherokee Nation, and then moved to Texas. He led the Texas Independence movement and served as Texas' president. Once Texas became a state, he served as state senator and later governor. He was eventually removed from his position as governor for refusing to join the Confederacy.</dc:description>
