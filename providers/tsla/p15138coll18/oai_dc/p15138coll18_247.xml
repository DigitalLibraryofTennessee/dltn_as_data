<dc:title>Care is costly: buy and hold war bonds</dc:title>
<dc:description>This World War II era poster features a striking image of a soldier with wounds on his right hand and left leg below the knee. The poster encourages Americans to purchase war bonds reminding them that ""Care is costly.""</dc:description>
<dc:description>The United States spent more than $300 billion supporting World War II by fighting the Axis powers and supplying our Allies. To fund this war, the United States Treasury issued war bonds that were purchased by Americans. The money raised was used to supply soldiers with uniforms, weapons, food and other things the military needed. To encourage citizens to purchase these bonds, the government created propaganda posters to advertise their availability and encourage support for war bonds from the home front.</dc:description>
