<dc:title>Letter to Governor Tom C. Rye from the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, Local Union No. 41</dc:title>
<dc:description>Letter dated July 12, 1918 in which the Nashville chapter of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters &amp; Joiners petitioned Governor Tom C. Rye to remove Theodore Hoepfner, a German-born American citizen, from his post as Assistant Factory Inspector of the Western Division of Tennessee. In addition, they suggested that "every man that has any German ties should be relieved of any Elective or Appointive Office" and replaced by a man born in the United States. Earlier, the Memphis chapter of this union had sent a similar letter alleging Hoepfner had started fires at factories in Memphis. The letter is signed by W. E. Cheers and E. E. Woodward, Business Agent.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Shortly after the United States entered World War I, Congress passed the Espionage Act of 1917. This legislation made it a crime to spread information or misinformation with the intent to interfere with the United States military or to contribute to the success of the country's enemies. The law also punished those who directly or indirectly contributed to insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or refusal of duty in the military. Tensions increased between American citizens, as naturalized and American-born citizens of German heritage came under suspicion concerning their loyalty to the United States.</dc:description>
