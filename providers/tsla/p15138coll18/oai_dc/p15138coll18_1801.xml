<dc:title>"General Industrial Conditions" Report of Comissioner of Labor, 1896</dc:title>

<dc:description>After the Civil War, industries in Tennessee began to build and expand. By analyzing the grand divisions of Tennessee individually, researchers can better understand how industrial expansion affected different Tennessee regions, including which businesses became prevelant in specific areas. The conditions report is a snapshot of Tennessee's economy thirty years after the Civil War. During Reconstruction, industrialization was key to the South's economic recovery and growth. More so, the large-scale industrialization is indicative of the New South, an ideal based on modernization of the South's society and attitudes in order to integrate more fully with the rest of the nation. In other words, the New South meant moving away from the economy and traditions of the Old South and slavery-based plantation system.</dc:description>
