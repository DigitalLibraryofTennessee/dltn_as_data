<dc:title>Letter from President Roosevelt to Gov. Browning</dc:title>
<dc:description>This letter is a response from FDR to an inquiry from Gov. Browning concerning the funding of the Tennessee side of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Browning asks why the North Carolina side of the park is entirely funded, but the Tennessee side is lacking almost a million dollars in funds. Roosevelt responds in this letter that several lawsuits in North Carolina had demanded immediate action with pay offs higher than estimated, which had reduced the amount available for purchasing in Tennessee.</dc:description>
<dc:description>For many years visitors to the Great Smoky Mountains were impressed by the natural beauty and argued for the region to be protected as a national park. By the1920s, Knoxville civic leaders and others began serious efforts to promote the creation of the national park. A bill to establish the Smokies as a national park was presented to Congress in 1937 and passed with little resistance. In September of 1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt came to East Tennessee to officially dedicate the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. </dc:description>
