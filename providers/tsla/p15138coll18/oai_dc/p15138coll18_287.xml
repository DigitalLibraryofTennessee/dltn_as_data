<dc:title>Lee S. Greene interview with Justice Joe W. Henry</dc:title>
<dc:description>This interview was conducted by Lee S. Greene in the process of writing his book, "Lead Me on: Frank Goad Clement and Tennessee Politics." Joe W. Henry served as the adjutant general of Tennessee from January 1953 to January 1959, which encompassed the desegregation of Clinton High School. Henry went on to serve on the Tennessee Supreme Court on September 1, 1974,and then served as the Chief Justice from 1979 until his death in June 1980. This interview with Henry highlights the role of the National Guard stationed in Clinton, Tennessee during the beginning of integration at Clinton High School. Henry also touches on the interaction of townspeople with the desegregation and how the public was involved.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Clinton High School, located in Clinton, Tennessee in Anderson County, was the first school in the state to be integrated in 1956 following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education. There were twelve African-American students who enrolled in the school in the fall of 1956, and they became known as the "Clinton 12." During the integration in the fall of 1956, Clinton was the site of anti-integration riots and protests, including the involvement of notorious white supremacist John Kasper. After the violence escalated on September 1, the National Guard was called into Clinton to keep the peace and protect citizens.</dc:description>
