<dc:description>Copy of a letter in which Joseph McMinn addresses the public and informs them that surveyors will soon be drawing boundaries around the land recently acquired by the United States from the Cherokee Nation.

<dc:description>Joeseph McMinn served as the governor of Tennessee from 1815 to 1821. Prior to that, he fought in the American Revolution, served on the Legislature of the Southwest Territory, and was the Speaker of the House for the United States Senate. After his time as governor, he became the United States' agent to the Cherokee Nation.In the late 1700s, territorial clashes between white settlers and American Indians including the Cherokees and Chickasaws led to a hostile and often violent environment between the two groups. Several series of treaties between the United States government and tribal governments were signed in an attempt to establish boundary lines and prevent further violence.</dc:description>
