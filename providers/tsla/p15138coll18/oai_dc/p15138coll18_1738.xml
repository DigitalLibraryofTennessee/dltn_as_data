<dc:title>Transport steamer "Lookout" on the Tennessee River</dc:title>

<dc:description>During the 1800s, rivers became an important part of Tennessee's economy with the introduction of the steamboat. As a result of the innovations of Robert Fulton, an American engineer and inventor from Pennsylvania, steamboats became a popular source to transport goods. With the development of the steamboat, goods could travel faster and be more maneuverable than the flatboats people had used previously. Over time, the busy river ports helped cities such as Nashville and Memphis grow and prosper.</dc:description>
