<dc:description>Winfield Scott was in charge of the Treaty of New Echota, a treaty that signed over the Cherokee lands in Tennessee and Georgia to the United States and forced the Cherokees to march to the "Indian Territory" in present-day Oklahoma. This treaty was not approved by the Cherokee Council, but signed by a member of the Treaty Party, a Cherokee minority political party. Under Scott, the project failed causing suffering for the Cherokees on their journey to Oklahoma. This journey was later referred to as the Trail of Tears.</dc:description>
