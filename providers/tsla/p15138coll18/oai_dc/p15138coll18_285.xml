<dc:title>Coal Creek Sensation</dc:title>
<dc:description>This article features a report made by Gen. Kellar Anderson of the Tennessee National Guard of a ""sensational"" incident with prisoner and miner James Muldoon. According to the report, all the miners in the valley had gathered to celebrate the anniversary of the first release of the convicts and General Anderson had issued orders to his men that no one should leave the militia camp. A young man by the name of Wooten was sent from the medical department to a store in the village and was there accosted by several miners, one which took his pistol away, pointed it at him, and made him give up his belt. This man was James Muldoon who was later arrested for the incident. His friends tried to unsuccessfully recapture him and after additional incidents, Muldoon was eventually handed over to a committee of miners who assured Gen. Anderson that he would be properly punished.</dc:description>
