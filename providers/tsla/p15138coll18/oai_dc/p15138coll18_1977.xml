<dc:title>Telegram to Governor Tom C. Rye from John E. McMillan, Mayor of Knoxville</dc:title>
<dc:description>Telegram dated April 3, 1917 to Governor Tom C. Rye from John E. McMillan, Mayor of Knoxville. The Knox County Boy Scouts of America County Division assembled and offered their volunteer services during the war the day after President Woodrow Wilson called an extraordinary session of Congress to declare war on the German Empire.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The patriotic climate in America during World War I inspired many children to volunteer for the war effort. President Woodrow Wilson, Secretary of War Newton D. Baker, and U. S. Food Administrator Herbert Hoover asked Boy Scouts to perform tasks such as collecting Liberty Loan subscriptions, planting war gardens, conducting a census of black walnut trees for gun and airplane manufacturing, collecting fruit pits and nut shells for gas mask filters, and distributing propaganda from the Committee on Public Information.</dc:description>
