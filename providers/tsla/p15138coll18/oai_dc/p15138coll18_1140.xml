<dc:title>World War II veteran survey for Cornelia Clark Fort</dc:title>
<dc:description>WWII veteran survey about Cornelia Clark Fort, filled out by her brother, Rufus Fort. Cornelia Fort served as a ferry pilot in the Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron (WAFS) during World War II and died while on a ferrying mission in 1943. Fort's brother filled out this survey in 1996, providing information about his sister's service and death. With the survey, he also submitted a supplemental article featured in the Nashville Scene. The article was written by Rob Simbeck who wrote Fort's biography. </dc:description>
<dc:description>Cornelia Fort was the first female pilot in Nashville to earn her pilot's license. Before the United States entered World War II, she worked as flight instructor and was giving a lesson in Hawaii when she nearly collided with a Japanese plane headed for Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Shortly after, Fort returned to the United States and was the second woman to join the Women's Auxiliary Airforce Squadron (WAFS). She became the first woman to die in military service during WWII when her airplane collided with another aircraft during a ferrying mission. Because of the volume of soldiers needed on the front lines during World War II, the United States government allowed women to fill non-combatant positions in the military in order to release as many men as possible for fighting. Every branch of the military incorporated women into their ranks in some fashion. In 1996, in an effort to expand its holdings about World War II, the Tennessee State Library and Archives sent surveys to World War II veterans from or currently living in Tennessee. Over 7000 veterans, or family members of veterans, returned completed questionnaires, often submitting additional supplemental materials, such as photographs, with their surveys. </dc:description>
