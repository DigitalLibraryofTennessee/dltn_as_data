<dc:title>Broad shoulders to carry the load</dc:title>
<dc:description>This political cartoon was drawn by the famous Tennessean newspaper artist, Jack Knox. The drawing shows a man holding two large baskets of food on his shoulders. The baskets are each marked with a "V" for victory. The back of the man's shirt states, "'plant to prosper' farmers." In the background of the drawing is a barn labeled "Mid South" and another man indicated as "John Public" who is tipping his hat to the farmer. A scroll at the top of the drawing states a quote from Secretary of Agriculture Wickard: "Food will win the war."</dc:description>
<dc:description>World War II brought a great need for soldiers on the battlefield and employees in the war industries. The need for food production also increased in order to provide food for all of the soldiers and aid to other countries in need. The government used the "Plant to Prosper" campaign in an effort to encourage farmers to stay on their farms instead of leaving for a job in industry. </dc:description>
