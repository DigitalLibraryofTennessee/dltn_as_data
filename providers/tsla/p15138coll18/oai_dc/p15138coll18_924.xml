<dc:title>Lists of Cades Cove property</dc:title>
<dc:description>This resource provides a listing of the different properties that were purchased from individuals to create the land that would eventually become the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.</dc:description>
<dc:description>From 1928 through 1936, the state of Tennessee purchased 105 parcels of land inside the Cades Cove area. This land was then added to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The Tennessee park bill granted the park commission the power of eminent domain to seize the property of those unwilling to sell, as long as owners received fair market value in return. </dc:description>
