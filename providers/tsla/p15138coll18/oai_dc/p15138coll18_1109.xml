Watkins is one of the most well-known soldiers in Civil War history. A private in Company H, he gained notoriety after the publication of his 1882 memoir, Company Aytch. Watkins was born in Maury County and enlisted in the army when Tennessee left the union in 1861.His unit fought at every major battle of the Army of Tennessee including Shiloh, Perryville, Kentucky, Stones River, Chickamauga, Franklin and Nashville.

<dc:description>In 1891, Tennessee established the Board of Pension Examiners to determine if Confederate veterans applying for pensions were eligible. Eligibility requirements included an inability to support oneself, honorable separation from the service, and residence in the state for one year prior to application. Confederate veterans applied to the pension board of the state in which they resided at the time of application, even if this was not the state from which they served. Pensions for widows were first issued in 1905. These applications show place of birth for widow and soldier and information about their children. Proof of marriage was required, so marriage licenses often appear in the supporting papers. </dc:description>
