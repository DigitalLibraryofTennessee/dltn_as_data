<dc:title>Letter of Lyman C. Draper to Matthew Rhea inquiring about the records of the State of Franklin</dc:title>
<dc:description>One-page handwritten letter, folded to be addressed on the back side, represents the inquiry made by historian and collector Lyman C. Draper of Matthew Rhea of Fayette County, Tennessee regarding Draper's quest for State of Franklin records.  Draper details his project, some of his Franklin research coups, and the lead that brought him to Rhea.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This inquiry from historian and collector Lyman C. Draper illustrates the mystery that has always surrounded the fate of the State of Franklin records. Here, Draper, the great document hunter, is pursuing them as early as the 1840s. The official state documents have proven largely elusive, though some county records have survived.  Repositories in Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia have holdings, but some appear to remain in private hands. Though a sizeable cache in the custody of Dr. J.G.M. Ramsey and the East Tennessee Historical and Antiquarian Society was lost during the Civil War, Ramsey confided to Draper, his long-time friend, that the Reverend Samuel Houston was said to have a multitude of Franklin records in his possession.</dc:description>
