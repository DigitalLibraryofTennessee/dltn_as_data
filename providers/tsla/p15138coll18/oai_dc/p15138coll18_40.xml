<dc:description>Wreckage of the Maine in Havana, Cuba</dc:description>
<dc:description>Secretary of State John Hay called it "a splendid little war," and its outcome was never in doubt. U.S. forces would ultimately crush the Spanish, ending an empire that had begun with the discovery of America four centuries earlier. Complete victory over Spain signaled the emergence of the United States as a major player in international affairs. The fighting in Cuba lasted about four months during the spring and summer of 1898. The conflict in the Philippines, however, would prove more troublesome . and cause more soul-searching. The fighting took place simultaneously in two theaters, Cuba and the Philippines. As the war broke out, Spain was attempting to suppress popular rebellions in both colonies. Stories of Spanish cruelty toward the Cubans were widely published, and newspapers did not hesitate to use propaganda to incite their readers. The term "concentration camps" originated during this period, arising from the reconcentrados (prison camps) the Spanish military had been using in Cuba. The case for war was advanced in part by the sinking of the USS Maine, an armored cruiser sent to Havana Harbor to protect American interests during the Cuban uprising. On February 15 an enormous explosion ripped apart the hull of the Maine, killing 266 sailors. The New York press, in a fit of jingoism, attributed the blast to Spanish sabotage and whipped up a ferocious war fever among readers. "Remember the Maine, to Hell with Spain!" became the rallying cry of those eager for war. Such sensationalism sold millions of newspapers. Some historians believe this "yellow journalism" helped precipitate war with Spain.</dc:description>
