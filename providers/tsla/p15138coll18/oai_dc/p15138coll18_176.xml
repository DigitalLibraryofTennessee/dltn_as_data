<dc:title>The Chesapeake, Ohio and Southwestern Railroad Company vs. Ida B. Wells</dc:title>
<dc:description>Ida B. Wells filed suit against the Chesapeake, Ohio, &amp; Southwestern Railroad Company in 1884 after being forcibly removed from one of its train cars. She sued for damages in the amount of $1,000. This 74 page document is the certified transcript of the case as recorded by clerk Joseph Uhl of the Circuit Court of Shelby County. The case was a non-jury case heard by Judge James O. Pierce. It includes testimony by Ms. Wells and witnesses G.H. Clowers, Silas Kerney, and G.W. Maseley for Wells as the "Defendant in error." For the railroad, testimony was heard from train conductor William Murry, Seth Curlin, Dr. J.E. Blades, and Dick Moody.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Born in Mississippi, Ida Bell Wells was an early leader of the movements for civil and women&#8217;s rights. In 1878, Wells lost both her parents to the yellow fever epidemic that struck the Memphis/Northern Mississippi area. She attended Rust College and became a teacher in the Shelby County school system. 

In September 1883, Wells purchased a first class train ticket to take her from Memphis to Woodstock, TN. After boarding the train, Wells was asked by a train conductor to move from the ladies car to the smoking car, which was crowded with passengers.  She resisted and was forcibly removed from the train car. 

Wells filed suit in 1884 against the Chesapeake, Ohio &amp; Southwestern Railroad Company and hired Thomas F. Cassels as her attorney. Cassels had represented Shelby County in the Tennessee General Assembly from 1881-1883, but she soon fired him when he dropped the suit, believing he had been &#8220;bought off&#8221; by the railroad company. Next, she hired James M. Greer, a former Union Officer, as her attorney.  Greer won the case in circuit court arguing that the company had violated two Tennessee statutes: one that prohibited railroads from charging blacks first-class fare and then seating them in second-class cars; the second statute required &#8220;separate but equal&#8221; accommodations for blacks and whites. On December 24, 1884, Wells was awarded $500 in damages in the Circuit Court of Shelby County. The Circuit Court&#8217;s opinion was overturned, however, by the Tennessee Supreme Court in 1887. It is important to note that this is taking place before the Plessy v. Ferguson Supreme Court decision that established the &#8220;separate but equal&#8221; doctrine and constitutionalized racial segregation. Wells was a strong opponent of the segregation of public facilities and would eventually leave Memphis for Chicago where she continued fighting for the rights of women and African Americans.
