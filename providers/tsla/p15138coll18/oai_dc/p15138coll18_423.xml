<dc:title>T.E.C. Bulletin, Monday, September 3, 1945</dc:title>
<dc:description>Issue of the T.E.C. Bulletin, a restricted, interoffice newsletter of the Tennessee Eastman Corporation during its wartime operation as part of the Manhattan Project. Of special note is the article titled "Groves Lauds Teamwork of TEC Workers To Make A-Bomb Success: Gave Japanese 'Face Saving Chance' " that describes director of the Manhattan Project Major General Leslie Groves's speech to Y-12 employees. During the speech, he claimed the Japanese government's statement about the high number of atomic bomb casualties was propaganda.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This issue of the T.E.C. Bulletin was published about a month after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the day after Japan formally signed the Japanese Instrument of Surrender, which officially ended World War II. After the war, the United States had to transition back into peacetime operations. Homefront practices such as rationing and buying war bonds came to a close. Negative attitudes toward the Axis powers, however, remained strong after the war's end.</dc:description>
