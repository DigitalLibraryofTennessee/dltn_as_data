<dc:title>Governor's Proclamation from the State of Franklin</dc:title>
<dc:description>One-page handwritten proclamation issued by John Sevier as Governor of the State of Franklin requiring all citizens to ignore a manifesto currently circulating in the state that incites insurrection.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The manifesto referenced was issued by the Governor of North Carolina, Alexander Martin, on April 25, 1785, reacting to Franklin's proclaiming its independence as a separate state. Governor Martin threatened the Franklin citizenry if they did not abandon this path and accused Sevier of being a traitor. Sevier countered with this proclamation that encouraged the Franklinites to obey their new laws and chastised North Carolina for providing the reasons for separation. Notably, Sevier evoked the Revolutionary War, dated the proclamation with the reference "in first year of our Independence" and ended with "God Save the State." North Carolina never recognized the independence of the State of Franklin, and it ceased to exist in 1788.</dc:description>
