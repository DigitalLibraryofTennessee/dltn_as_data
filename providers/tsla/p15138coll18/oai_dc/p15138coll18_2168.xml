<dc:title>A map of Buchanan's (Demonbreun's) cave</dc:title>
<dc:description>A small sheet of grayish-blue paper with two hand-drawn illustrations: the left one giving a cross-section of the length of cave itself; the right one mapping the location of the cave's two entrances in relation to Mill Creek and the Cumberland River.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The location shown on the map indicates that the cave mapped is the same one used by French-Canadian fur trader Timothy Demonbreun (1747-1826) to hide from hostile Native American hunting parties and to store his trade goods prior to his construction of a trading post above the river bank. The map itself identifies the cave as "Buchanan's Cave." This name may derive from the fact that the cave was located near Buchanan's Station, one of the fortified farmsteads constructed by the early American settlers. According to Buchanan family history, one of this familiy's sons, Samuel Buchanan, was cut off from the safety of the station by a surpise Native American attack. He attempted to reach a cave in order to hide from his pursuers, but injured himself in a leap off a bluff above the cave mouth and was killed. Samuel's father James and brother Alexander were also killed in Native American attacks.</dc:description>
