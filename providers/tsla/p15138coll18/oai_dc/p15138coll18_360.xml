<dc:title>Letter from Alice Rhyne to Governor Frank Clement</dc:title>
<dc:description>This letter is from Alice Rhyne, a citizen from Clinton opposing integration. The letter is very short with only a brief condemnation of Clement's actions towards integration. However, what is really of interest is a copy of a song written about the integration in Clinton that is included with this letter. Titled the "Clinton Ballad", this song presents a critical view of the actions of the federal government, local Anderson County judiciary, John Kasper, Clement, and the citizens of Clinton during integration of the school. Also included in this letter is an illustration titled "I Aided Integration" and depicts three white men: a National Guardsman, one that is presumably Governor Clement, and an unknown white man. The National Guardsman is holding a small African American boy and standing on top of a white woman's body. The woman is wearing a ribbon labeled "Majority Rule".</dc:description>
<dc:description>Clinton High School, located in Clinton, Tennessee in Anderson County, was the first school in the state to be integrated in 1956 following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education. There were twelve African-American students who enrolled in the school in the fall of 1956, and they became known as the "Clinton 12." During the integration in the fall of 1956, Clinton was the site of anti-integration riots and protests, including the involvement of notorious white supremacist John Kasper. After the violence escalated on September 1, the National Guard was called into Clinton to keep the peace and protect citizens.</dc:description>
