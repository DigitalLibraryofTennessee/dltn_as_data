<dc:title>Aims of the patrons of husbandry</dc:title>
<dc:description>This full-page clipping from the Grange Outlook contains an address prepared by W.H. Jackson for the Farmers' meeting at Manchester, July 4 1874. Many of the nascent issues that would mold populist sentiments are outlined. These include dealing with "middlemen," curtailing the power of railroads to charge discriminatory rates, and reforming public education.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The farmers' movement began with the Grange of the Order of the Patrons of Husbandry. Steeped in masonic roots, this organization sought to spread information and pool resources in a spirit of cooperation amongst farmers. Their surviving publications highlight such efforts as they become politically and socially charged.</dc:description>
