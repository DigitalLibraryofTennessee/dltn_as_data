<dc:title>Town of Norris a year after</dc:title>
<dc:description>This article provides some insights about the community of Norris that was created to house the workers on Norris Dam. The articles featured in the Norris News newspaper are written by and for TVA employees.</dc:description>
<dc:description>As a way to house the workers who constructed Norris Dam, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) created a village with houses, a school and other community buildings. During the 1930s, Norris was similar to a company town where TVA operated practically everything such as the cafeteria, the town's gasoline station and the local auto repair shop. After the dam was completed, the workers left Norris. Professionals who worked for TVA or in Knoxville saw the town as an attractive alternative to city living and Norris gradually turned into a white collar suburb of Knoxville. In June 1948, the federal government sold the town to a private corporation, which resold the individual lots to the residents.</dc:description>
