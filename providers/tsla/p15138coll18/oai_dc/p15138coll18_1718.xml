<dc:title>Letter from W.S. Beasley of the Columbia Produce Company to Governor Hill McAlister</dc:title>
<dc:description>Letter from W.S. Beasley of the Columbia Produce Company to Governor Hill McAlister regarding the child labor amendment. Beasley writes in opposition to the amendment stating that "...of this amendment is passed, crime by our youth will be tremendously increased and it will overflow the penal institutions of our land."  He goes on to write "I strongly oppose the exploiting of our children and I believe the safeguards that public sentiment has already built for them is good, but, please let us not legislate our boys and girls into idleness." </dc:description>
<dc:description>In 1938, President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Fair Labor Standards Act, which, in part, restricted the employment and abuse of child workers. The Act restricted children under age 16 from working during school hours. Prior ot the Act, many employers preferred hiring children because they were usually cheaper, more manageable, and less likely to strike.</dc:description>
