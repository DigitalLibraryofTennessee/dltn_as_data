<dc:title>Letter from Mrs. W.C. Patton, Mrs. N.S. Davis, and Mrs. A.G. Hargett to the Memphis Press-Scimitar</dc:title>
<dc:description>This document is a copy of a letter sent to the Memphis Press-Scimitar from three women representing the Women's Christian Temperance Union in Halls, Tennessee. The letter denounces the policy of the newspaper The Press-Scimitar in Memphis toward the cause of prohibition and suggests they are on the side of the "wets". The authors reference an article that appeared on the front page titled "Peay, Bone Dry, Given Whisky to Save Life" and proclaim it as propaganda. </dc:description>
<dc:description>The Prohibition movement was organized in the middle of the 19th century as part of a religious movement. As its popularity increased, several states banned consumption of alcohol. The 18th Amendment (passed 1917, ratified 1919) and the Volstead Act (passed 1920) both supplemented the movement, attempting to ban all alcohol in the United States. The 21st Amendment repealed the Prohibition laws in 1933. The Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) organized in Nashville in 1881 and worked to gain ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment. Nationwide, the WCTU was the largest anti-alcohol organization.  </dc:description>
