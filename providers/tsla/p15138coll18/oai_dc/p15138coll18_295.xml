<dc:title>Permanent capitol building for the State of Franklin</dc:title>
<dc:description>Log cabin Capitol building of the State of Franklin in Greeneville, Tennessee.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The State of Franklin was created in 1784.  The first General Assembly of Franklin met in 1785 and elected John Sevier governor. Jonesborough functioned as the provisional capital of the Franklin goverment from August 1784 to December of 1785.  Greeneville became the permanent capital in December of 1785. With the governments of the State of Franklin and that of North Carolina operating simultaneously in the same geographic area during a portion of this period, this Greeneville permanent capitol structure, the proceedings that took place within, and the resulting documents provided validation and stature to the new, independent state. The State of Franklin ceased to exist in 1788.  This original log cabin structure was dismantled to be reassembled in Nashville for the Tennessee Centennial Exposition in 1897.  A replica was eventually constructed at the Greeneville site when the logs were not returned to the city.</dc:description>
