<dc:title>Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant, also known as K-25</dc:title>
<dc:description>This photograph shows the K-25 plant at Oak Ridge that separated u-235 from u-238 using the gaseous diffusion method. The facility covered more than 1,500 acres and, at that time, was the largest building under one roof in the world. Note that the buildings have few windows except on the top floor.</dc:description>
<dc:description>K-25 is the World War II code name for the gaseous diffusion plant at Oak Ridge. Construction on the plant began in mid-1943 and was not completed until early 1945. The plant was decontaminated and demolished from 2008 to 2013.</dc:description>
