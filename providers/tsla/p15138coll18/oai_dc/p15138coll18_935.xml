<dc:description>Mountains often have coves, which are flat-floored valleys in the mountain's side. Many coves in the Great Smokies have been important in the settlement of the area. Some of the appealing features of coves for earlier settlers were the fertile soil and the protection they offered from severe weather conditions in the mountains. The most famous cove in the Great Smokies is Cades Cove, located south of present day Knoxville.</dc:description>
