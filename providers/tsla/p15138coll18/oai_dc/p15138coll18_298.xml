<dc:title>Experimentation on livestock by the Atomic Energy Commission at Oak Ridge, Tennessee</dc:title>
<dc:description>This photograph shows three scientists using a Geiger counter to measure radiation during an experiment on a cow. The scientists pictured are likely researchers at the Agricultural Research Laboratory at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which was operated for the Atomic Energy Commission by the University of Tennessee after World War II.</dc:description>
<dc:description>After the test at the Trinity site in New Mexico and the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, scientists observed that the high radiation levels that were the product of these detonations had severe environmental effects. Likewise, the sites where radioactive materials were produced were impacted. Many post-war studies were conducted to measure negative effects of the production at Clinton Engineer Works on the environment of Oak Ridge and the health of its community.</dc:description>
