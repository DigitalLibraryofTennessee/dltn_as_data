<dc:title>Letter from James K. Polk to Hagan &amp; Heiss printing company</dc:title>
<dc:description>Letter from James K. Polk to Hagan &amp; Heiss printing company. This letter reprimands the newspapermen for not printing Polk's political opponent Martin Van Buren's name next to his in an article. This omission apparently caused some of Polk's opposition to use the article as proof of Polk's "prejudice" in the presidential election.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The presidential election of 1844 had a surprise outcome. Dark horse nominee James K. Polk, the little known former governor of Tennessee, ran on the popular promise of territory expansion. He grouped a conflict with Great Britian over the Oregon Territory with the annexation of the Republic of Texas. By promising to incorrporate these territories into the United States, Polk transcended fractions within the Decomcratic Party and defeated the much better known Whig candidate Henry Clay, as well as former president Martin Van Buren.</dc:description>
