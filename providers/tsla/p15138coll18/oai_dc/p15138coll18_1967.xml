<dc:title>How to "Reach" the Masses: Typical Speech #4</dc:title>
<dc:description>Form speech written for use by the Four Minute Men Association. This speech attempts to refute arguments against the United States' involvement in World War I such as Germany's attitudes toward liberty, Great Britain's political motivations, the United States' economic motivations, and the interests of American soldiers. It urges speakers to reference specific events as justification for American involvement in the war such as the sinking of the RMS Lusitania, Belgian deportations, Dr. Dumba and Von Papen, the Zimmerman telegram, and "spurlos versenkt" messages against Argentina. It describes the Four Minute Men speaker's intended audience as American people who possessed "semi-understanding and lukewarm enthusiasm" for the war.</dc:description>
<dc:description>President Woodrow Wilson was intially hesitant for the United States to become directly involved in World War I, and America traded with both the Allied and Central Powers before entering the war in 1917. Two major events in 1917 that spurred the United States to intervene in the war were Germany's announcement that it would resume unrestricted submarine warfare and the discovery of the Zimmerman telegram, a message from Germany to Mexico that promised to help the country reclaim land lost to the United States in the 1840s. As a justification for entering the war, Wilson said "The world must be made safe for democracy," to a joint session of Congress.The Four Minute Men Association was developed during World War I to provide a means for dissemination of information on Liberty Bond drives. The organization was directed by the Committee of Public Information and acquired its name because speakers at meetings were urged to speak for only four minutes.</dc:description>
