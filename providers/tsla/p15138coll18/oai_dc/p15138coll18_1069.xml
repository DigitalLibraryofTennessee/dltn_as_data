<dc:title>A shower at last</dc:title>
<dc:description>This political cartoon features a farmer with two cows and a farm house in the background clearly suffering the effects of a drought. During the droughts of the 1930s on the Great Plains, farmers and migrant workers suffered significantly from the lack of rain and its impact on agriculture. Under Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, programs such as the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act, the Federal Surplus Relief Corporation, the Drought Relief Service, and the Civilian Conservation Corps helped to alleviate the problem.</dc:description>
<dc:description>During the 1930s, drought affected the entire Great Plains area of the United States. There were four major droughts which mostly affected agriculture. Crops were damaged by lack of rain and insect infestations and dust storms were a frequent problem during this period. Federal and state governments implemented drought relief programs under Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal program.</dc:description>
