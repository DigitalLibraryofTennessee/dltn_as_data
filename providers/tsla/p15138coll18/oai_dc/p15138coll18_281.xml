<dc:title>Gibson County letter- murder by the Kuklux</dc:title>
<dc:description>This letter to the editor, appearing in the Nashville Daily Press and Times on March 24, 1868, reports of a murder of an African American man in the southwest corner of Gibson County. The author states that the case has not been investigated and that the freedmen are continually alarmed at the threats being thrown out. He goes on to say ""I am fearful we are approaching trouble of a serious nature.""</dc:description>
<dc:description>The first Ku Klux Klan was founded in 1865 by veterans of the Confederate Army. At its inception, the Klan was initially a social club for young men seeking amusement and entertainment in the aftermath of the American Civil War. The Klan resisted the process of Reconstruction by intimidating ""carpetbaggers"", ""scalawags"", and freedmen. The Klan quickly adopted violent methods and the increase in murders finally resulted in a backlash among Southern elites who viewed the Klan's excesses as an excuse for federal troops to continue occupation. The organization declined from 1868 to 1870.</dc:description>
