<dc:title>When life needs a lift, it's Maxwell House Coffee time</dc:title>
<dc:description>A Maxwell House Coffee advertisement that features an illustration of a character drawn to look like Rosie the Riveter who is drinking coffee on her lunch break. The advertisement reminds the reader that Maxwell House Coffee is a Nashville-founded company, and suggests coffee goes well with dinner and also as a "pick-me-up" for U.S. soldiers.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Because of the labor shortage produced by men joining the armed forces during World War II, women were encouraged to take jobs in nearly every industry and the armed forces. Patriotic characters like Rosie the Riveter and Molly Pitcher were created to inspire women to do their part in the war by getting a job in war industries to replace the men leaving for the battlefront. Many companies of popular products used this change as an advertising strategy. </dc:description>
