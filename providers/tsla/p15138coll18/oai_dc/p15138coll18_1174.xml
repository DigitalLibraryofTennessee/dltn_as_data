<dc:title>Interview with Vina Cardwell about her experience working with explosives in an ammunition plant</dc:title>
<dc:description>Audio interview of Vina Cardwell by the Tennessee Historical Society. Cardwell describes her work on an assembly line in an ammunitions plant during World War II. She explains that she was adding her measured amount of explosive powder to the projectiles, then passing them down the line to the next person. In one particular instance, one of the projectiles went live under a mechanized press and shot a hole in the roof of the building. She states that she and her co-workers quicky regained their composure and returned to work. She remembers that no one seemed afraid to work so close to explosive materials and everyone returned to work the next day. </dc:description>
