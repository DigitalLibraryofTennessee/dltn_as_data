  <abstract>This photo was taken in Glasgow, Scotland when Australian soldier Arthur Miller was on leave from the front in France. He had come to Scotland to propose to Miss Annie McCrory. He is posed with her father William who is seated. The marriage never took place, as Miller died shortly after this picture was made in France from a ruptured appendix. Approximately 295,000 Australians served in Europe in World War I with 46,000 dying and another 132,000 becoming casualties.</abstract>
