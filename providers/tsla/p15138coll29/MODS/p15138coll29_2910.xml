  <abstract>This photograph, taken in France, shows an American soldier sitting atop a caission with a row of caissions extending behind him. There is a machine gun mounted on the caission on which the soldier is sitting. Other soldiers are seen partially behind the caission. They are not in a forward area as they are not wearing helmets. The Still Image is one of a large collection which belonged to Sgt. Ernest West, Batry. B, 114th F.A. Regt., 30th Div. West was from the Chattanooga area as was most of Batry. B.</abstract>
