  <abstract>This is the last letter written by David Gourley of Cades Cove, Tennesee. Gourley died on the transport ship in route to Europe, a victim of the "Spanish" flu pandemic. He was in the 20th Company, 5th Training Battn., 175th Depot Brigade. The letter was written to his brother James Gourley. The "Spanish flu" hit the world in 1918 and was particularly deadly to young adults between the ages of 20 and 40 years old. Approximately 500,000 Americans died and as many as 50 million world wide.</abstract>
