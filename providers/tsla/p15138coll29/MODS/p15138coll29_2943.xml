  <abstract>Two American soldiers are shown leaning against a crude log structure. The man on the left is wearing gloves and appears to be holding the tip of an artillery round in his right hand. He has also secured his canteen to his right leg by using twine. The soldier to the right has an artillery round in his right hand. Both men are smoking cigarettes. The Still Image belonged to Sgt. Ernest West, Batry. B, 114th F.A. Regt., 30th Div. and was probably taken at Camp Sevier, South Carolina.</abstract>
