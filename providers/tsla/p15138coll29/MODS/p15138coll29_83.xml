  <abstract>Informative postcard notifying recipient, "The Ship On Which I Sailed Has Arrived Safely Overseas." The card is addressed to Mrs. E. A. Roller, Antioch, Tenn. and was sent from John Roller, HQ Co., 115th FA, 30th Div. The American Red Cross provided post cards so that soldiers could easily notify their loved ones at home that they had arrived in Europe. The cards were mailed as "soldiers mail" and therefore required no postage. The 115th FA served in the 30th Div. and saw heavy action in France.</abstract>
