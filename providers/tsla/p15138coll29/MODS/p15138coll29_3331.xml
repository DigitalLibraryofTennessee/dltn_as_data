  <abstract>Loose-leaf black binder filled with notes of Howard's WW I experiences. It commences September 4, 1918, when he reports to the Chattanooga draft board, although he was from Henagar, Alabama. His assignment was as a cook in the 57th Pioneer Inf. Regt. From Camp Merritt, N.J., they sailed past the Statue of Liberty and then to France. Many soldiers were sick with influenza. Howard includes a list of full-pack equipment and writes of the Armistice and feeling hunger for the first time.</abstract>
