  <abstract>The officer, nicknamed "Bat," is standing beside a field artillery piece painted in "dazzle camouflage." The gun appears to be a 1917 Schneider. John Lindsey was born in Greeneville, but lived in Chattanooga. He joined the army as a private while still a student at the University of Tennessee. He was appointed as a 2nd lieutenant on August 31, 1918 in the 96th Field Artillery and later the 66th Field Artillery. He worked as a general contractor in Chattanooga after the war.</abstract>
