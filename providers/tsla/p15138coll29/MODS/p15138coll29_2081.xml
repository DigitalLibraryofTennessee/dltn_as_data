  <abstract>Pvt. Henry R. Hubbs, a box maker from Knoxville, served in Co. E, 130th Inf. Regt., 33rd Div. This pay record indicates that he made $15 a month as a soldier in Co. E, 130th Inf. Regt., 33rd Div. According to family tradition, his arrival to the front was delayed by damage to his transport ship. Hubbs escaped without harm. He arrived too late to experience combat and served his time overseas in Luxembourg. He trained at Camp Gordon, Georgia and was overseas until May 20, 1919.</abstract>
