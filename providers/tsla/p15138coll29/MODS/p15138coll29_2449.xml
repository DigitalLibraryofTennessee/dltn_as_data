  <abstract>Pvt. Frank M. Ring was from Franklin, Williamson County, Tennessee. In the letter he discusses that he had not written in some time and that he was trying to write this letter while "in a little dog tent and it raining too." He tells her that they are off the line and so far back that they can't "hear the big guns this is the first time we got out of their hearing." He also tells her about some of the men that had been wounded and talks about gas attacks. Frank would be killed in action a month later.</abstract>
