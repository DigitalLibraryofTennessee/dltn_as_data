  <abstract>This postcard, provided by the YMCA, shows "Singing Sammies" - an early name used for American soldiers, derived from "Uncle Sam." Pvt. Henry R. Hubbs, a box maker from Knoxville, served in Co. E, 130th Inf., 33rd Division. He trained at Camp Gordon, Georgia. He wrote that he was sending his wife $15 because he did not need it. He had $14 left. According to family tradition, Hubbs arrived too late for combat because of damage to his transport ship, and served in Luxembourg.</abstract>
