  <abstract>Pencil sketch of a tiger's head by British private Harold Hanson, West Yorkshire Infantry Regiment. The tiger's mouth is open in a growl so that its sharp teeth are visible. Two doves of peace hover above. Hanson was born in Wyke, West Yorkshire, and was killed in action in France on October 7, 1918, a little over a month before the Armistice was signed. The West Yorks won over 200 battle honors during the Great War. Its regimental buttons and pins displayed a tiger with tail up.</abstract>
