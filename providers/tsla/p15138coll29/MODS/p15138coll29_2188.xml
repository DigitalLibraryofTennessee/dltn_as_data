  <abstract>This handwritten letter is from Musician Kenneth Redford, HQ Co., 114th FA, 30th Div., to his mother. He mentions that the band has been playing for a show. He expects to be going to France soon. He says they took their finger prints making it hard to desert and also writes about a group of men who were absent without leave. He describes a new order regarding anyone AWOL for more than 10 days. He mentions the firing range and some of the men finding moonshine and attacking an officer with a knife.</abstract>
