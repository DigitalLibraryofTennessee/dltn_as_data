  <abstract>The Ring family of Williamson County, TN provided three brothers to the American Army. Maj. Joseph J. Ring, Co. B, 308th Eng. Regt., wrote this letter to his mother and suggests many items that his younger brother Frank should carry with him to the army. He mentions that prices for uniforms in Chillicote are very expensive. He also discusses the conscripted soldiers and complains that one man in his unit has had "almost everything you can think of. Everyday he shows up with a new disease."</abstract>
