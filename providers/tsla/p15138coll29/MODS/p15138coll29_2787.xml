  <abstract>The Ring family of Williamson County, Tennessee sent three sons to WWI. Maj. Joseph J. Ring was the oldest and served in the 308th Engineer Battn. In this letter his mother mentions going to Franklin to see the "Baby Tank" that is to be there to raise awareness of the "Victory Loan." She relates to her son that another man was by and told her of the wounds and death of Joseph's younger brother, Frank Ring. He was wounded three times and David Fleming carried him to the "Casual" Station in his truck.</abstract>
