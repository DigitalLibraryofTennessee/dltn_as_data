  <abstract>Jeff Montgomery, USMC, wrote this letter to his future wife Ruth Hopper in Jackson, Tennessee. Montgomery is in training at the Marine Corps Barracks on Parris Island. He enlisted only a few weeks before the armistice. Montgomery mentioned that they "didn't know Halloween from any other night." They had been allowed to explore the island. He told Ruth that he thought the war was about over and he had "given up all hope of sailing to France." He concluded with discussion of mutual acquaintances.</abstract>
