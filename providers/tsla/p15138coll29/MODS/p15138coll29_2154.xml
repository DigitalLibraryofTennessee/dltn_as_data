  <abstract>Major Bernard Edwin Ragland (1894-1963) served in the Dentist Corps and was a member of the Medical Detachment of the 155 Inf. Regt., 39th Div. during World War I. He is pictured wearing his military issue coat and a Sam Browne belt. His grandfather, Evan Ragland, was from Wilson County, Tenn. He enlisted in 1917, served in France and Germany, and was honorably discharged on Sept. 3, 1919. After the war, he owned a dental practice until he was elected County Clerk of Lafayette County, Mo. in the 1930s.</abstract>
