  <abstract>Jeff Montgomery, USMC, wrote this letter to his future wife Ruth Hopper in Jackson, Tennessee. He wrote, "Well I wonder who is with you tonight. Some lucky fellow I guess (sic) wished it was me." He describes missing church due to an inspection. "Sergeant "Balled" us out because there were three or four that didn't have on their clean clothes but the whole company had to take the medicine." The letter was written on Knights of Columbus stationery.</abstract>
