  <abstract>This is the diary of Lt. John Barksdale Greer, 117th MG Battn., 31st Div. and 324th MG Battn., 83rd Div. Both divisions provided replacements to other units. Greer was from Loudon County, Tennessee. Inside the diary was his calling card and a Red Cross post card announcing that he had arrived safely overseas. It was mailed to his mother Mrs. John G. Greer. Greer mentions that a "yell went up" as his ship passed the "Statue of Liberty." He discusses a burial at sea and that men are sick with the flu.</abstract>
