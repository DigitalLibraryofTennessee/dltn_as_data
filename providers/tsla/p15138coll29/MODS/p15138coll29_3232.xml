  <abstract>From the donor's grandmother's house, these plaques were, according to translations kept with the mounted plaques, "Captured by United States forces at St. Juvin" which was in the Somme sector east of Amiens. German directions on brass plates were affixed on the rear of mobile field kitchens and provided exact directions on making coffee and cooking in the large kettles. The plates were apparently taken in the field as souvenirs and mounted on a wooden plaque with translations of the German in an envelope.</abstract>
