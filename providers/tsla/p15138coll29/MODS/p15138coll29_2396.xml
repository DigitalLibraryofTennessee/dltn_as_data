  <abstract>This photograph shows Berry N. Lunn (identified here as "Willie") in a photograph of cooks holding pans and food. Lunn was from Williamson County, Tennessee and served in the 157th Deport Brigade. He was transferred to the School for Bakers and Cooks at Camp Gordon, Georgia and was promoted to cook in August 1918. The photograph may have been taken while he was at Camp Gordon for training.</abstract>
