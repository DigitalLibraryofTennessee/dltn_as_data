  <abstract>Pvt. Perry Benjamin Austin of Finley, Tennessee in uniform. He drove a truck [GWjack003] in Motor Truck Co. 536 in France during World War I. He told his family that his truck was shot at while he transported canned tomatoes. The resulting tomato mess led his company believe that he had been shot. He served in France until June 1919. A mink trapper before the war, he ran a trolley car in Jackson after the war, and later worked as a carpenter. [See also GWjack001-GWjack010]</abstract>
