  <abstract>This M1910 has a custom made navy blue woolen cover with a khaki canvas carrying strap. The cover is closely fitted with the strap sewn directly to it. This method of carrying a canteen was similar to the method used by the French and may have been added after the war. It belonged to Pvt. James McFerren Johnston, HQ Co., Ord. Corps, attached to the 114th MG Battn., 30th Div. The 30th Div. consisted of National Guard units from Tennessee and North and South Carolina and was called the Old Hickory Division.</abstract>
