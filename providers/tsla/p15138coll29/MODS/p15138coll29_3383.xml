  <abstract>This colorized postcard depicts German soldats (soldiers) in a trench. The title is translated as "Life in the Trenches" and shows a soldier on watch, one lounging, one reading a newspaper, one smoking a pipe, and one emerging from a bunker. The stamp on the reverse indicates that the sender was in the 120th Landwehr Regt. Landwehr regiments were composed of older men and intended for rear echelon duties. In WWI, they often saw combat. In 1918, members of the 120th were among those captured by Alvin York.</abstract>
