  <abstract>Chase was commander of the USS Minnesota when she struck a German naval mine in September 1918. The ship was saved and he was awarded a Distinguished Service Medal for his splendid seamanship. Graduating from the Naval Academy in 1890, Chase served in the Spanish-American War. After World War I Chase rose to the rank of rear admiral and Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Fleet. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery after his death in 1937. He is misidentified on the reverse as "C. B. Chase."</abstract>
