  <abstract>A real photo postcard showing two men in uniform with leggings. The one on the left appears have his shirt collar turned down over the coat collar. The one on the right shows both collar discs. The photo was probably taken before they went overseas. The brothers were from Rickman, Overton County and served in Co. B, 119th Inf. Regt., 30th Div. They trained at Camp Sevier and had previously served in Co. C, 2nd Regt., Tenn. National Guard. They were overseas from May 1918 to April 1919.</abstract>
