  <abstract>Jeff Montgomery, USMC, wrote this letter to his future wife Ruth Hopper in Jackson, Tennessee. Montgomery is in training at the Marine Corps Barracks on Parris Island. He enlisted only a few weeks before the armistice. Montgomery discussed training and receipt of their uniforms. He explained that they recently moved barracks, and that his testament that Ruth gave him had been stolen. He decribed the other men in his company. He concluded with personal sentiments toward Ruth.</abstract>
