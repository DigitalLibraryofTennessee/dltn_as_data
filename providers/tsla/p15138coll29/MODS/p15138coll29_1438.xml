  <abstract>This postcard shows a soldier telling his mother "Don't Worry about Me" under which Pvt. Joseph William Knox wrote, "How true this is." He told her that he was fine, and asked her to wait and send the cigars to his new post after he moved, if she had not already sent them. Knox of Dyer, Tennessee served in Co. E, 11th Inf. Regt. He arrived in France in September, 1918 and saw action during the final week of the Meuse-Argonne offensive. He served in France until July 1919. [See also GWjack018-024, 500-516]</abstract>
