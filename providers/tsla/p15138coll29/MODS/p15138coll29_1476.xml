  <abstract>Pvt. Joseph William Knox of Dyer, Tennessee, served in Co. E, 11th Inf. Regt. He arrived in France Sept. 1918 and fought the last week of the Meuse-Argonne offensive. He served guard duty after the armistice. He wrote that the sun was shining after days of rain, that he was having a good time, learning a word a day of the language and had a bed with springs. Knox said he was broke, but payday was a few days off, then wished his family Happy New Year. [See also GWjack018-024, 500-516]</abstract>
