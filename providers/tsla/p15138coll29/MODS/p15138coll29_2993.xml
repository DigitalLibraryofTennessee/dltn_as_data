  <abstract>A letter on YMCA stationary from Geiger to his sister. He refers to family news and says he does not think he will be able to find Homer Geiger. He tells her the price of a dozen eggs is 3 Francs (about 60 cents) and a pound of butter is 3 to 4 Francs. He describes the farmhouses in France with adjoining barns and stables where the animals are on one end and the people live in the other, yet the houses are clean. He also asks for magazines. Geiger served in Btry. B, 114th Field Art., 30th Div.</abstract>
