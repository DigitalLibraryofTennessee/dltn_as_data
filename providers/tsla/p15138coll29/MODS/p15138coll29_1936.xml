  <abstract>Pvt. Metcalf, Co. A, 47th Engineer Battn., wrote his mother, this time from France. He indicates that he received 3 letters from her and they were the first he had received since arriving in Europe. He requests that she send him newspapers from home and tells her not to be concerned about him, "for I am coming back safely and it won't be very long." Metacalf, from McMinn County, Tennessee served in France from July 1918 to June 1919. His mother apparently was in Maryville, Tennessee.</abstract>
