His unit saw no combat action and this card represents the fact that the unit spent most of their time playing cards. It is signed by several fellow officers including E.H. Arrington, C.R. Dorsey, B. Fleming, and John B. Greer. Written on it is "This represents one solid week of Poker in the city of Mayet." A poker chip that has the soldiers initials on it is also included.
