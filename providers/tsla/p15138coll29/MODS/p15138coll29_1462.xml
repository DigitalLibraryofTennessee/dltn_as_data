  <abstract>Pvt. Joseph William Knox of Dyer, Tennessee, sent this military postcard to his father from Camp Gordon, Georgia. The printed text said that he had arrived safely, had participated in daily drills, enjoyed games and music and would write upon arrival at headquarters. Knox served in Co. E, 11th Inf. Regt. He arrived in France in September, 1918, and saw action during the final week of the Meuse-Argonne offensive. He remained on guard duty in France until July 1919.
