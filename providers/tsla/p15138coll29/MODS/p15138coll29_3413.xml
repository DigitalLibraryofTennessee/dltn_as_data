  <abstract>Photograph the Old Hickory Village west of Hadley from 12th St. The firehall, with its distinctive tower, can be seen to the right, facing the concrete-paved Hadley St. Most of the houses west of Hadley were of tar paper construction and became known locally as "tar babies". The small buildings between the two rows of houses in the picture were for coal storage. The single smoke stack on the left was part of the heating system in the village. The smoke stack was demolished in June 1946.</abstract>
