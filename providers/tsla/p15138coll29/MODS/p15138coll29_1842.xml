  <abstract>This letter was written to Lt. John Barksdale Greer, 117th MG Battn., 31st Div. The letter is associated with a photograph [GWmary075] of a girl who travelled to France unchaperoned during or just after World War I. The letter discusses Christmas, his accomodations, his decision to go to the regular army or the reserves, and his desire to go to Russia (persumably to fight the Communist). She also expresses that for him to associate with French girls would be unpatriotic. It is signed "Pauline Kay."</abstract>
