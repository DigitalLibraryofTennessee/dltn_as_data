  <abstract>Edward L. Chandley posed with his overseas cap in his hand. He was born in Scottsville, Kentucky in 1893. He listed his occupation as "farming &amp; teaching" in Adolphus, Kentucky on his draft registration card. He tried to claim exemption due to his wife's health. However, he was assigned as an aircraft mechanic. After the war, he moved to Old Hickory, Tennessee and worked at the DuPont Plant for thirty-five years. He died at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Murfreesboro, Tenn. on February 4, 1976.</abstract>
