  <abstract>Baggenstoss was from Tracy City, Grundy County, Tennessee and was the son of Swiss immigrants. He ran away and joined the Navy at age 17. He served aboard USS New Jersey and USS Delaware and was involved with the search for the missing transport USS Cyclops. His service included work with seaplanes and he apparently worked the Navy's Trans Atlantic flight in 1919. Seaplanes NC-1, NC-3 and NC-4 were to be part of a team to make the transatlantic flight. Only NC-4 completed the mission.</abstract>
