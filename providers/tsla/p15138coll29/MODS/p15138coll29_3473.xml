  <abstract>Political unrest in Mexico beginning in 1915, led to a raid into American Territory in early 1916. Pancho Villa and approximately 1,000 men attacked Columbus, New Mexico in March 8, 1916. Although the attack was repulused by US troops, there were 24 casualties. Troops were deployed to the border and a punitive expedition launched. The Tennessee National Guard was among those deployed. The joint resolution from the Tenn. General Assembly asks that the Tennesseans be returned to the state.</abstract>
