  <abstract>The Ring family of Franklin, Tennessee sent three sons to WW I. In this letter, Frank, the third son, writes back to his youngest brother, James. He thanks him for sending nuts, pants and socks and lists the people from which he had received letters. He mentions that the newspapers started a rumor that farmers could get a furlough to help get "in the crops." Frank says there is no chance of him getting a furlough. Frank served in Co. A, 114th MG Battn., 30th Div. He was killed in action in Oct., 1918.</abstract>
