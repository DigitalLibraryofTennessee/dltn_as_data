  <abstract>The Ring family of Williamson County, Tennessee sent three of four sons to WWI. Frank M. Ring served in the 114th MG Battn., 30th Div. He writes to his brother James, who is at home in Franklin. He discusses that they had received "Enfield" rifles and he did not like them as much as the Springfields. The unit had only three machine guns-two Lewis guns and one Colt but they are to receive the Browning water-cooled gun. He is also armed with the Model 1911 Colt pistol. Frank was killed in October 1918.</abstract>
