  <abstract>Pvt. Joseph William Knox of Dyer, Tennessee, sent this postcard to his father, saying this is what they did "one hour every day." He hoped that his mother was not truly ill and asked about the crop. He said that he was doing fine after "getting over all the inoculations." Knox served in Co. E, 11th Inf. Regt. He arrived in France in September, 1918, and saw action during the final week of the Meuse-Argonne offensive. He remained in France until July 1919. [See also GWjack018-024, 500-516]</abstract>
