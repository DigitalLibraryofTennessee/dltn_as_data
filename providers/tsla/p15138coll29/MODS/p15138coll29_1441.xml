  <abstract>This postcard shows soldiers at target practice. Pvt. Joseph William Knox, training at Camp Gordon, Ga., wrote on the front, "This picture is true of today's work." He told his mother that he had been on the range two days and made a good score, and that the hikes were not too long. Knox of Dyer, Tennessee served in Co. E, 11th Inf. Regt. He arrived in France in September, 1918, and saw action during the final week of the Meuse-Argonne offensive. [See also GWjack018-024, 500-516]</abstract>
