<dc:title>Photograph of the Old Hickory Swinging Bridge</dc:title>
<dc:description>The suspension bridge was located in Rayon City at the end of Swinging Bridge Road. It was diverted from its original destination in South America due to the urgency of the war effort. By the time that the bridge was officially accepted in December 1918 the war had ended and the powder plant had closed. While the bridge had two towers at each end the 540 foot span had no supports to prevent sidesway and literally swayed back and forth, hence the name &#65533;swinging bridge.&#65533; The bridge was dismantled in 1928.</dc:description>
