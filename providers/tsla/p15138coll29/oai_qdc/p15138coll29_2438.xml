<dc:title>Letter from Major Joseph J. Ring to his mother Sarah Frances M. Ring</dc:title>
<dc:description>Major Joseph J. Ring 308th Eng. Battn., was one of three brothers from Williamson County, Tenn. to serve in World War I. In this letter, written after the armistice, he mentions that he can provide more details as the "censor's regulations was lifted." He tells his mother that he is about ten miles northeast of Luxemburg and twelve miles from the German border. He goes on to tell her that he was in the drive for Chateau Thierry and that his unit was just behind the lines and got shelled all of the time.</dc:description>
