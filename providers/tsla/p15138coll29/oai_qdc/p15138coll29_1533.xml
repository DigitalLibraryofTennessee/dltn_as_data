He discusses having had another holiday, a reference to Thanksgiving, and that he had qualified as a "marksman." His letter is written on Jewish Welfare Board stationery. He wrote, "it seems like I patronize most every religious body on the island but who would have thought that I would come to a Jewish plase but this is the most quiet place on the island just room for about six Marines."</dc:description>
