  <abstract>School on Hadley and Robertson roads at the Old Hickory DuPont Gunpowder plant. The sign on the school reads "United War Work Campaign November 11th to the 18th."</abstract>
  <abstract>One of the benefits for workers at the Old Hickory DuPont Gunpowder plant was the schooling facilities. The schools were 250 feet by 350 feet and segregated according to race. Children were taught during the day while adults had the opportunity to take classes in the evenings. DuPont boasted that one schoolhouse was constructed, from start to finish, in ten days.</abstract>
