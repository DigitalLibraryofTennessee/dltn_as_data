<dc:description>Sheet music, consisting of six pages, with an etching of an "African-American" representing the "Old Contraband."  The composers are listed on the front cover.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Contraband was a term commonly used in the United States during the Civil War to describe a new status for certain escaped slaves or those who came into the possession of Union forces.  The Confiscation Act of 1861 declared any property used by the Confederate military, including slaves, could be seized by Union forces.  By the end of the war in April 1865, an estimated ten thousand had applied to gain "contraband" status.</dc:description>
