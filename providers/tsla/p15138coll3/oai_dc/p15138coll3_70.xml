<dc:title>Negro recruits taking the cars for Murfreesboro, Tenn., to join the Federal Army</dc:title>
<dc:description>This engraving features African Americans being guided onto a troop train headed for Murfreesboro where their wish to join the Federal Army will be granted. This illustration appeared in Frank Leslie's post-war volume "The Soldier in Our Civil War" (which has a number of editions), but it most probably premiered in "Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper" during the actual conflict.  The origin of this colorized version is unclear.</dc:description>
<dc:description>English-American engraver Frank Leslie informed ordinary Americans during the Civil War with his periodicals, such as "Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper" which contained remarkable wood-cut illustrations. His engravers illustrated volumes such as "The Soldier in Our Civil War" published after the war.  C. E. F. Hillen was one of Leslie's artists who was badly wounded in the Atlanta Campaign. Two of Leslie's artists were captured and released by Lee, and one part-time artist, James O'Niell, was killed.</dc:description>
