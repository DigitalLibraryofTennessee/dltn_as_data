<dc:title>Bivouac of captured rebels on an island near Bridgeport, Tennessee [sic]</dc:title>
<dc:description>Image of captured Confederates on an island erroneously labeled near Bridgeport, Tennessee; the location is near Bridgeport, Alabama.  The site is at the current CSX Bridge 122.6 over the Tennessee River Slough.  Several clashes took place here due to the strategic, transportation, and communication importance of the site.  Twice during the Civil War, the superstructure of the bridge was  destroyed and rebuilt.</dc:description>

From 1830 to 1860, one and a half million Germans settled in the United States.</dc:description>
