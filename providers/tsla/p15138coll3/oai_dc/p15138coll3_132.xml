<dc:description>Description reads: When General Brannan made his daring and successful dash upon the railroad between Pocotaligo &amp; Coosawhatchie the terror in both Savannah and Charleston was very great.  Despite the fact that General Beauregard with 30,000 troops was stationed midway between the cities a restless desire for flight took possession of thousands and for three days the roads to the interior were crowded.</dc:description>
