<dc:title>Ingenious devices of soldiers in the camp and on campaign</dc:title>
<dc:description>Fifteen images illustrating the imaginative way that Civil War soldiers tackled a variety of transportation, housing, equipment, and survival issues.  Engravings on the back of the page appeared in Frank Leslie's post-war volume "The Soldier in Our Civil War," but they most probably premiered in "Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper" during the actual conflict.  The origin of this illustrated page is unclear.</dc:description>
<dc:description>At the beginning of the Civil War, there were already millions of subscribers to Northern newspapers in the country.  People had responded warmly to the amazing wood-cut illustrations of "Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper," and soon competitors like "Harper's Weekly" and "New York Illustrated News" emerged to imitate Leslie's combination of graphics and written news.  The quality of the artwork varied greatly, and conveying accurate military news graphically proved challenging.</dc:description>
