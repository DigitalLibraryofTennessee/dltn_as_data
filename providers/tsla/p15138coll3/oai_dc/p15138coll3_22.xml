<dc:title>Sketch of Fort Delaware</dc:title>

<dc:description>Fort Delaware served as a harbor defense facility for the Delaware River beginning with the War of 1812.  The pentagon-shaped fortification present during the Civil War had been constructed from 1848-1859 and was the largest fort in the country.  Confederate prisoners and local Southern sympathizers were housed in wooden barracks on Pea Patch Island, not inside the fort itself.  Most prisoners were captured at Gettysburg.  The prison held forty thousand men by war's end; approximately 2,700 died there.</dc:description>
