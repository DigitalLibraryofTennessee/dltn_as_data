<dc:title>View of the stockades and fortifications around the Capitol, Nashville, Tennessee</dc:title>
<dc:description>Image presents the juxtaposition of the beautiful architectutral features and sculpture exhibited in the  east, or main fascade of the Tennesseee State Capitol Building with the surrounding heavy Federal stockades, fortifications, and general military occupation features.</dc:description>
<dc:description>During Federal military occupation, the Tennessee Capitol Building eventually came to be known as Fort Andrew Johnson due to the mounting fortications that built up around it.  The Parrot Guns that are pictured in the image were capable of sending a projectile one mile.  The eight gas lamps made by Wood and Perrot of Philadelphia were  positioned at the Capitol entrance staircases and  had at their bases cast iron figures representing morning, noon, and night.</dc:description>
