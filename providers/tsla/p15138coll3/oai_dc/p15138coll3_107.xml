<dc:title>Letter from J. Wes Broom to Miss G. A. Brigham featuring drawings</dc:title>
<dc:description>Letter from J. Wes Broom to Miss G.A. Brigham describing the fighting around Port Hudson.  It describes a night battle with Federal ships and the effectiveness of the Confederate batteries positioned in the fort.  There are also comments on scientific study, botany and astronomy.  The letter includes two color drawings, one of men manning a cannon, and the other of a Federal side-wheeler in flames.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Confederates held Port Hudson until July 1863.  A siege by Federal ships and troops eventually wore down the defenders and 6,500 Confederate troops surrendered.  The port was captured and the Federals won control of the Mississippi River.</dc:description>
