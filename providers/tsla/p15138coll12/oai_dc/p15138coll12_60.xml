<dc:description>Built by businessman Thomas Ryman for revivalist Sam Jones, the Ryman Auditorium opened in 1892 as the Union Gospel Tabernacle.  When Ryman died in 1904, the building was renamed in his honor. From 1942-1974, the Ryman hosted the Grand Ole Opry broadcast. Vacant from 1974-1992, a series of Emmylou Harris concerts renewed sufficient interest in it that it was restored in 1994. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971 and National Historic Landmarks in 2001.</dc:description>
