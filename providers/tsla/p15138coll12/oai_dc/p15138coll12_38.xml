<dc:description>The Ryman Auditorium opened in 1892 as the Union Gospel Tabernacle. It was built by businessman Thomas Ryman for revivalist Samuel Porter Jones. After Ryman died in 1904, the building was renamed in his honor. Site of Grand Ole Opry broadcasts, 1942-1974, then vacant until a series of Emmylou Harris concerts (1992) renewed interest in it. Restored in 1994; placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971 and National Historic Landmarks in 2001.</dc:description>
