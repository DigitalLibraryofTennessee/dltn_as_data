<dc:description>Known as the Mother Church of Country Music, Nashvilles Ryman Auditorium, designed by architect H. C. Thompson, was originally built as a religious meeting hall and was called the Union Gospel Tabernacle.  It was built by steamboat captain Thomas Green Ryman, after his conversion at an 1885 revival preached by Sam Jones. The Ryman was the home of the Grand Ole Opry from 1943 to 1974.</dc:description>
