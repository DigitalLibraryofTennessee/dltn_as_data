<dc:description>Born in Nashville on October 12, 1841, Captain Tom Ryman had gathered a fleet of 35 riverboats by 1885 to form the Ryman Line.  He proved to be the most influential man of his day in the Cumberland River shipping industry and fought railroad competition his entire life.  The Rev. Sam Jones's revival in 1885 inspired Ryman to build the Union Gospel Tabernacle in Nashville--the structure that would carry his name as the famous Ryman Auditorium after his death in 1904.</dc:description>
