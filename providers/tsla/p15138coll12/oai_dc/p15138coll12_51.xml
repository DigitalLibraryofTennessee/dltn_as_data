<dc:description>Photograph shows the entertainers on a raised stage and the backs of the heads of the audience, seated in a semi-circle. The facade of a barn is the background with a sign over the doors reading "WSM Grand Ole Opry."  A small sign to the right of the doors reads, "A Service of National Life and Accident Co."  Advertisements can be seen hanging in front of the barn. The stage is full of musicians and performers, none of whom are identified in the photograph.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Grand Ole Opry is a radio variety show featuring country music entertainers performing before a live audience. The program began in October 1925, sponsored by the Nashville-based National Life and Accident Insurance Company. The insurance company's motto was "We Shield Millions." The initials provided  the call letters for WSM, the radio station that broadcasts the Opry.</dc:description>
