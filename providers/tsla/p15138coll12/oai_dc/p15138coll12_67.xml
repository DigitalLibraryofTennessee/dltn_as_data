<dc:description>The May Musical Festival of 1892 brought the Theodore Thomas Orchestra to Nashville to assist the Ladies' Hermitage Association in preservation efforts for The Hermitage.  Founded in 1862, the orchestra toured extensively and then settled in Chicago. They would go on to become the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. This particular Nashville performance unfortunately lost money, operating at a deficit of $336.70.</dc:description>
