<dc:description>This image is part of a series of photographs taken of the Ryman Auditorium between 1970 and 1972 for the Historic American Buildings Survey. During this period, the Ryman Auditorium seated 3,300.  Windows, including those appearing here, were opened for ventilation during the shows.  Fans often watched and listened at these open windows, and some fans proved a challenge for Opry security (mostly off-duty firemen) by trying to climb in through the windows.</dc:description>
