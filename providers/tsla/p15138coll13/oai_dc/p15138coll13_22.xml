<dc:description>Two-page letter written by Ammons to his family on the day he arrived in Vietnam.  He describes conditions and housing at the 90th Replacement Battalion headquarters, 22 miles north of Saigon; the appearance and poverty of the Vietnamese villagers; and the assignment of PVT Smith (Smitty) to the 4th Infantry Division.  He relates the instructions he was given if "Charlie" shells the 90th Replacement Battalion area.  He would stay at this outpost briefly until assigned as a replacement.</dc:description>
