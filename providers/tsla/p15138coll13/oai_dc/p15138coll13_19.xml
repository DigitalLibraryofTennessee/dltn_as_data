<dc:description>The 2nd Infantry Division (the Indianhead Division) was activated on October 26, 1917 at Beaumont, France.  The motto of the Division is "Second to None."  The 2nd Division proved the first unit of reinforcements to reach Korea directly from the United States when fighting broke out in the summer of 1950. It was the first unit to break out of the Pusan Perimeter and drive with the 8th Army to the Manchurian border.</dc:description>
