<dc:description>The UH-1 (or as it was originally designated the HU-1) "Huey" is one of the most recognizable and widely used helicopters in the world.  During the Vietnam conflict, Hueys were used for many purposes including MedEvac, command and control, air assault, personnel and matriel transport, etc.  It has several distinctive characteristics such as a rounded nose, a twin-bladed rotor, and the loud "whomp-whomp" sound the helicopter makes in flight.  Approximately 7,000 UH-1 aircraft saw service in Vietnam.</dc:description>
