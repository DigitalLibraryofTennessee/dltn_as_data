<dc:description>Eleven soldiers in a squad about to go on a patrol around the signal base on Vung Chua Mountain.  A soldier in front of the group poses with an M-60 machine gun. He has belts of ammunition for the weapon over both shoulders. The soldiers in the background carry M-16s and have belts of ammunition over their shoulders as well.

<dc:description>According to Ammons, regulations for carrying ammunition for the M-60 machine gun were relaxed for patrols around Vung Chua Mountain.  During his first tour in the front lines of the delta, he said, ammunition was stored in boxes. These boxes were hard to carry, but kept the rounds clean and prevented jamming.  On Vung Chua ammunition was carried more casually whenever the threat of enemy attack was reduced.</dc:description>
