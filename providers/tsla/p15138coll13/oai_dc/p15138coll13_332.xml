<dc:description>Black &amp; white two-sided document that functions as a reward leaflet, offering 7.500$ for an RPD machine gun, but also serving as a surrender pass.  Ammons has written in ink at the top of the front side "picked up in 'Iron Triangle' Jan. 5, 1968." The reverse side contains a list of eleven rewards or advantages one might receive from the government by surrendering. This was Leaflet SP-3863.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Chieu Hoi (Open Arms) program represents a 10-year psychological operation launched by the South Vietnamese government in 1963 to encourage the "return" or "rally" of Viet-Cong, North Vietnamese Army soldiers, and Communist sympathizers. American involvement came to dominate this pacification program.  The "SP" was an American code for "Special Project." The Viet-Cong exploited it, encouraging the idea that leaflets came from the people's government only.  The code soon disappeared.</dc:description>
