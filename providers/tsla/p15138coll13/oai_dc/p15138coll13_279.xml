<dc:description>SGT Christopher Ammons, pictured on his last patrol in Vietnam, appears to be fully armed. He is wearing a soft hat commonly called a "boonie" or "bush hat." This one has a fabric tape band of branch loops around the crown. These loops are meant to hold additional vegetation as camouflage.</dc:description>
