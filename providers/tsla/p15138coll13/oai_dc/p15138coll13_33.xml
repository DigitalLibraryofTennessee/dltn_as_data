<dc:description>Three-page handwritten letter written from Ammons to his family recounting his attendance at the Bob Hope USO show on Christmas Eve in 1967. He describes being issued clean fatigues, flying on a Chinook helicopter to Lai Khe Base Camp, and viewing Hope with his customary golf club and girls.  Back with the platoon, Chistmas Eve carols are interupted, but Christmas Day involves radio calls, packages, Santa in a Huey, the 1st Infantry Band, and Christmas lunch with the General.</dc:description>
