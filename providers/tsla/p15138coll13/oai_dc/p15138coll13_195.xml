<dc:description>Ammons has explained that soldiers on Vung Chua seldom wore helmets or uncomfortable flak vests on standard patrols.  This expedition was either a special patrol across the bay (to lay seismic detectors) or a trip to Qui Nhon, both of which would have required soldiers to wear their full equipment.</dc:description>
