<dc:description>Chieu Hoi (Open Arms) program represents a 10-year psychological operation launched by the South Vietnamese government in 1963 to encourage defection of Viet-Cong, North Vietnamese Army soldiers, and Communist sympathizers. Strategies included safe-conduct leaflets, rewards programs, returnees' testimonials, and a focus on being home for the Tet New Year. The enemy's weaknesses were gauged as fear, hardship, loss of faith in victory, concern for family, and disillusionment.</dc:description>
<dc:relation>Are you suffering from starvation?
To the cadres and soldiers belonging to the Front of the Liberation of South Vietnam and the North Vietnam&#8217;s armed forces!
We know you are hiding in the deep forests, clinging to a hopeless ideology while you are facing starvation and an imminent death. Yoleaders at all levels have forsaken you. Your comrades have been killed. And you are alone. Why do you have to continue with this tragic and miserable life? Return to the National government! You will be warmly welcomed, kindly received, and have sufficient medical treatment.
