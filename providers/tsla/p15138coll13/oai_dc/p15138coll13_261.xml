<dc:description>Two Vietnamese women in traditional dress are entering from outside into a dark room. A guard appears outside in the sunlight. The doorway appears to be quite thick. Another female worker appears in the light and is about to be passed in by the guard. The Vung Chua Mountain site, where this photograph was taken, is located north of Qui Nhon.</dc:description>
