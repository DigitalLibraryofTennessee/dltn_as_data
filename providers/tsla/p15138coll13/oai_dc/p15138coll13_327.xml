<dc:description>The Chieu Hoi (Open Arms) program represents a 10-year psychological operation launched by the South Vietnamese government in April of 1963 to encourage the "return" or "rally" of Viet-Cong, North Vietnamese Army soldiers, and Communist sympathizers.  American involvement later came to dominate this pacification program.  An estimated 160,000 defections occurred. The airdrop leaflet was the most commonly used item of inducement, but leaflets were also distributed by hand.</dc:description>

hamlet or military post&#8230;
If you see any soldier who belongs to the Republic of Vietnam or Allied armed forces, you just need to raise your hands over your head and shout, &#8220;Open arms!&#8221; Designated Open Arms places will be established in provinces. Speakers from airplanes will inform you of where these places are located so that you can safely present yourselves there.
If your &#8220;Open arms&#8221; surrender happens from one o&#8217;clock in the morning, October 9, to midnight October 15, you will be eligible for a $2000 reward along with other benefits that are available to the returnees. You will be warmly welcomed and kindly treated. 246-131-68 (Translations provided by the Tennessee Foreign Language Institute)</dc:relation>
