<dc:description>Six soldiers preparing to depart on a truck for patrol, photographed from behind the truck bed. One soldier is pointing to or reaching for his rifle.  The truck is probably  a "deuce and a half," slang for a two-and-a-half-ton truck. The photograph is from Ammons's first tour in 1968.</dc:description>
