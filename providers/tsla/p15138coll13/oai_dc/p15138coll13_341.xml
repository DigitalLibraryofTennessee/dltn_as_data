<dc:description>The Chieu Hoi (Open Arms) program represents a 10-year psychological operation launched by the South Vietnamese government in April 1963. Defection was encouraged by using the five themes of Chieu Hoi: exploitation of ralliers, rally appeals, third party inducement, advertisement, and instructions on how to rally.   Five billion leaflets were air-dropped over Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia in seven years.</dc:description>
