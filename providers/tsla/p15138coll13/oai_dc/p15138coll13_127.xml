<dc:description>Three-page letter describes a plane crash on Vung Chua that killed eight South Korean officers. (The plane, still visible on the mountain, and a nearby monument are pictured in Ammons's photos.) No one knows why the plane was so far from the Qui Nhon Airfield, where it was trying to land. Ammons, describing the current inclement weather, conjectures that the thick cloud cover and heavy rain may have confused the pilot.</dc:description>
