<dc:description>Ammons stated the bunkers usually were manned by two men and typically contained an M-60 machine gun and an M79 grenade launcher.  Bunker duty was one of the most common assignments on Vung Chua.  Ammons worked in the radio room and frequently called the bunkers late at night to make certain that the occupants were awake and alert.</dc:description>
