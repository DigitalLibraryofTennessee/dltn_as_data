<dc:description>The small two-engine plane crashed on the southeast side of Vung Chua Mountain on November 11, 1969.  It carried eight high-ranking officers, including two colonels who were to be promoted to brigadier general on January 1, 1970. The plane was scheduled to land at the Qui Nhon Air Field, but bad weather brought it down two-and-a-half miles southwest of Qui Nhon.</dc:description>
