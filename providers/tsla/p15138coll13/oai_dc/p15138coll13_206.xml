<dc:description>Soldiers waiting to leave Vietnam from Cam Ranh Bay.  There are dozens of men in uniforms and hats standing around a booth marked with the sign "507th Replacement Company."  Above the booth is another sign titled,  "Be in proper uniform," with a list of what is expected ("Clean shaven," "No unauthorized insignia," etc.  Two men are working in the booth.  Several sets of barracks can be seen in the background.</dc:description>

<dc:description>According to Ammons, two or three formations would gather in the central location on the base at Cam Ranh Bay to hear the reading of the names of men who were leaving Vietnam to return home.  The formations would wait until the list was read, after which time those whose names were called flew out of Cam Ranh Bay back to the United States.</dc:description>
