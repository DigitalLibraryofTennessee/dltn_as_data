<dc:description>Letter to his family dated Nov. 26, 1967, begins, "At 9:30 this morning seven of us hopped aboard the truck to take us to the outer edge of the perimeter. We were going for a 3 click (3,000 meters) patrol outside the camp." On his first patrol he found  propoganda leaflets in a cleared area, rice paddies, water buffaloes, children asking for cigarettes, and pot growing in a field.  He ends as follows: "All the days are the same no Sat. or Sundays, it just seems like the same day over and over again."</dc:description>
