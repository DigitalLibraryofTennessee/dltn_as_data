<dc:description>Three-page handwritten letter from Ammons to his family.  It contains a hand-drawn diagram of the 3rd Platoon's road-clearing operation; the account of a friendly jet dropping bombs very close to a Viet Cong village and very close to his unit as they cleared Highway 13; and Ammon's description of firing his first two rounds of M79 "harrassment fire" at "Charlie."</dc:description>
