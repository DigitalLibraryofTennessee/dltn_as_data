<dc:description>The Chieu Hoi (Open Arms) program represents a 10-year psychological operation launched by the South Vietnamese government in April of 1963 to encourage the "return" or "rally" of Viet-Cong, North Vietnamese Army soldiers, and Communist sympathizers.  American involvement later came to dominate this pacification program. Leaflets, loudspeakers, radio, film, newspapers, display items, rallies and performances, publications, and other media were all employed in the effort.</dc:description>
