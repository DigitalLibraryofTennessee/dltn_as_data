<dc:description>Sgt. Chris Ammons sits on a rock while on patrol near Vung Chua Mountain.  He is wearing a boonie hat and has a towel wrapped around his neck, as was customary in the sweltering climate of Vietnam. He is holding his M-16 assault rifle, and another rifle can be seen leaning against the rock. Note: a non-color-corrected master TIFF copy is also available.</dc:description>
