<dc:description>The Chieu Hoi (Open Arms) program represents a 10-year psychological operation launched by the South Vietnamese government in April 1963 to encourage the "return" or "rally" of Viet-Cong, North Vietnamese Army soldiers, and Communist sympathizers.  American involvement later came to dominate this pacification program.  An estimated 160,000 defections occurred. The airdrop leaflet was the most commonly used item of inducement, but leaflets were also distributed by hand.</dc:description>
