<dc:description>Soldier sleeping near a wooden structure with his head resting on what appears to be a rolled-up sleeping bag and a military-issue back pack.  A helmet, pair of boots, and an M-16 rifle are at his side.  Further military-issue gear of a similiar sort are lined up against the side of the building nearby.  Photograph is from Christopher Ammons's first tour in 1968.</dc:description>
