<dc:description>Three-page letter written from Dong Tam, final headquarters base camp of the 9th Infantry Division. Ammons describes an air assault in which the platoon was pinned down in knee-deep water under heavy fire by the Viet-Cong. He writes, "The leeches were terrible," and people's feet were damaged from being in the water for so long. The attack resulted in 13 casualties. This letter also mentions the Plain of Reeds (Dong Thap Muoi).</dc:description>
