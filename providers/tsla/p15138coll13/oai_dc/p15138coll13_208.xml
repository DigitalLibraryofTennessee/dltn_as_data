<dc:description>Pictured are the large tropospheric arrays on top of the mountain. The tropospheric array was designed to bounce microwave radio signals into the atmosphere and then back down to receivers. This system was extremely effective in transmitting signals in mountainous or densely forested regions, and it was used extensively in Vietnam.</dc:description>
