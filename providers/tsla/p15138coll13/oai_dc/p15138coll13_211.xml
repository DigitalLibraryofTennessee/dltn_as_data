<dc:description>Ammons stated that many of the civilians from nearby Qui Nhon assisted in the maintenance of the base on Vung Chua Mountain.  Men, like the individual pictured, typically cut the grass and maintained the grounds; many women polished boots and cleaned the floors at the base.</dc:description>
