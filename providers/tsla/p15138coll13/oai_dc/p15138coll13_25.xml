<dc:description>The 1st Infantry Division, the oldest division in the United States Army, is referred to as "The Big Red One"--an allusion to the graphic on the shoulder patch; it is also known as "The Fighting First." The 1st Infantry Division was the first divisional unit to fight in Vietnam and sustained 6,146 killed in action during the conflict.</dc:description>
