  <abstract>Ammons's four-page letter on U.S. Army stationery to his mother and father describes his first days in the Army. He relates the military routine, getting his dog tags, standing fire watch, and waiting for his uniform. He remarks on the fact that many in his barracks had been in the National Guard, while others were drafted. Ammons enlisted on June 1, 1967, one week after he graduated from high school.</abstract>

    <abstract>The Christopher D. Ammons collection documents his military service during two tours in Vietnam (1967-1970).  The collection includes wartime photographs of Vietnam, letters from the front, military documents typical of the period, and souvenirs collected by Ammons from his time “in country.” The material will be of significance to researchers interested in the Vietnam War and its veterans, the experiences of soldiers in modern warfare, and/or the military aspects of United States political history during the 1960s and 1970s...</abstract>
