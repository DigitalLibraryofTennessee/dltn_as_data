  <abstract>Christopher Ammons describes typical patrols during his first tour in Vietnam and an incident that resulted in his sustaining an injury. His unit was ambushed while on patrol and he was struck in the back of the head by shrapnel from a rocket propelled grenade. He received a Purple Heart for the wound. The 4:24 minute video is cut from the full interview.</abstract>

    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>The Christopher D. Ammons collection documents his military service during two tours in Vietnam (1967-1970).  The collection includes wartime photographs of Vietnam, letters from the front, military documents typical of the period, and souvenirs collected by Ammons from his time “in country.” The material will be of significance to researchers interested in the Vietnam War and its veterans, the experiences of soldiers in modern warfare, and/or the military aspects of United States political history during the 1960s and 1970s...</abstract>
