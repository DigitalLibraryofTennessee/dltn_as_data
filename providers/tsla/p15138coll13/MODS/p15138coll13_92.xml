  <abstract>Seven-page letter written by Christopher Ammons recounting a sniper attack on his company the previous day that claimed the lives of four soldiers. While on patrol 6,000 meters southwest of Saigon, Ammons's squad comes under sniper attack, and for the first time, he sees the enemy. He is pinned in a canal by sniper fire and cut off from the rest of the company, but his lieutenant is mortally wounded. Artillery and another platoon eventually come to the aid of his squad.</abstract>

    <abstract>The Christopher D. Ammons collection documents his military service during two tours in Vietnam (1967-1970).  The collection includes wartime photographs of Vietnam, letters from the front, military documents typical of the period, and souvenirs collected by Ammons from his time “in country.” The material will be of significance to researchers interested in the Vietnam War and its veterans, the experiences of soldiers in modern warfare, and/or the military aspects of United States political history during the 1960s and 1970s...</abstract>
