  <abstract>Letter to his family dated Nov. 26, 1967, begins, "At 9:30 this morning seven of us hopped aboard the truck to take us to the outer edge of the perimeter. We were going for a 3 click (3,000 meters) patrol outside the camp." On his first patrol he found propoganda leaflets in a cleared area, rice paddies, water buffaloes, children asking for cigarettes, and pot growing in a field. He ends as follows: "All the days are the same no Sat. or Sundays, it just seems like the same day over and over again."</abstract>

    <abstract>The Christopher D. Ammons collection documents his military service during two tours in Vietnam (1967-1970).  The collection includes wartime photographs of Vietnam, letters from the front, military documents typical of the period, and souvenirs collected by Ammons from his time “in country.” The material will be of significance to researchers interested in the Vietnam War and its veterans, the experiences of soldiers in modern warfare, and/or the military aspects of United States political history during the 1960s and 1970s...</abstract>
