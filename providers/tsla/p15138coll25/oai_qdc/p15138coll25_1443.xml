<dc:description>The Silver Dollar Saloon, located at 100 Market Street (Second Avenue), is a three-story Romanesque brick building designed by architect Julius G. Zwicker and completed in 1893.  In 1889,  V. E. Schwab purchased the property at Broad and Market Street. The building has terra cotta details, including a wreath and shells on the fa&#231;ade. A turret is above the main entrance to the building. Other architectural details include a large cornice with a terracotta frieze, stringcourse molding, and large encased arched windows on the second floor. The building's name came from the floors made of silver dollars. V. E. Schwab was associated with George A. Dickel &amp; Co., as his brother-in-law was George A. Dickel, and the saloon served their whiskey. The saloon attracted riverboat crews who worked nearby, with it offering drinks, lunch, and lodging.  During prohibition, the saloon transformed into a soft drink emporium and restaurant.   The Watkins Block, located at 108-114 Second Avenue, was built in 1875 by brickmaker Samuel Watkins, a prominent builder in Nashville. The building is a three-story, brick Italianate style building. Paired brackets support the large overhanging cornice. Brick dentil ornamentation runs above the third-story windows. Shouldered metal moldings with keystones accentuate the round windows on the upper floors. The center structure of the block has a dated parapet. Four years after the construction of the building, Samuel Watkins started on plans for the Watkins Institute. Historically, the building had an assortment of different occupiers, such as Herman Bros., Lindauer &amp; Co., the largest wholesale house in 1889, and the laboratories, offices, and warehouses Spurlock Neal Co. Wholesale druggists since the 1890&#8217;s. </dc:description>
