<dc:description>The Engine Company No. 2 served as the department's headquarters while located at North Market Street (Second Avenue) near the Public Square. Descriptions of the building at the location state it was a three-story brick building. One of the rooms on the third floor served as the battery room for the fire alarm telegraph. The location also had a one-story building at the rear used as a repair shop for the department. Engine Company No. 2 moved from their location on North Market Street in 1903 to a new building on Summer Street (now 5th Avenue) near Deaderick.</dc:description>
