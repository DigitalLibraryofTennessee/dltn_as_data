<dc:title>Sulphuric acid plant</dc:title>
<dc:description>View of the sulphuric acid plant at Tennessee Copper Company.</dc:description>
<dc:description>In 1899, the Tennessee Copper Company was incorporated and chartered by the Lewisohn Brothers, and work began that year on the mining properties and clearing the land for the development of plants. Prior to this, the area had already been used by the copper mining industry. By 1902, the company was looking into sulfuric acid production and soon began experimenting with it. The first of the sulfuric acid plants was completed in 1907. Eventually, the ecological devastation of the area led to it being considered the largest man-made biological desert in the country and also brought about the first study on the long-term effects of acid rain.</dc:description>
