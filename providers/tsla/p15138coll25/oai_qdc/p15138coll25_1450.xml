<dc:description>The Watson House, operated by proprietor Thos. S. Watson, was a first-class hotel located at 20 Market Street, near Public Square and Union Street. The three-story brick building had a flat roof. Each of the upper floors had balconies facing the street. In the 1850s, the hotel was renovated and refurnished, with the board rates in 1858 being $1.50 per day or $8.50 per week.  During the Civil War, Union forces occupied the Watson House, and the building was used in connection with Hospital No. 19 (currently 210-212 Second Avenue). Union forces also occupied other nearby buildings on the street.</dc:description>
