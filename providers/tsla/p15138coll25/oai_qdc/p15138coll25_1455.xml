The grocery business was founded by Christopher Cheek, with son Leslie Cheek later becoming his partner. Leslie Cheek purchased 100 acres to build the Cheekwood Estate, including the home and garden, after the sale of the family business. Other previous occupants have included B.

Weakley &amp; Co., wholesale grocers Hibbett, Gentry &amp; Co., and harness factory Montgomery-Moore Manufacturing Co. in the early 1900&#8217;s. A description of the former building from when Montgomery-Moore Manufacturing Co. occupied it states the building was a six-floor building that was one of the largest on the block. Former occupants of the current building include McWhorter, Weaver &amp; Co., who started leasing the property in 1922, Music City Manufacturing, and Nashville China &amp; Equipment Co.   The building located at 176 Second Avenue is a four-story, Italianate-style brick building constructed around 1875. Properties 174 and 176 are nearly identical in construction, with one of the main differences being the arched windows at 176 Second Avenue. Both buildings have similar arched parapets, corbeled brick, window molding, pilasters, stringcourses, and large cornices.  The Orr Bros. owned the building from 1876 through 1880, with Robert Orr and family associated with it from 1881 through 1951. In 1890, the building was occupied by Orr,  Jackson and Co., a wholesale grocery firm. The company occupied the entire building, utilizing the third-story operating as a factory in 1908 to produce extracts such as O.J. No. 11. Previous addresses for the building include 42, 58, and 60 South Market Street.  The Berry &amp; Demoville building, located at 174 Second Avenue, is a four-story, Italianate style brick building constructed around 1875. The building has an arched parapet, corbeled brick, and cornice supported by brackets around the roof area. The top of each window has detailed stone hood molding. The metal cornice above the storefront has elaborate end caps and decorative medallions. The property was owned by Charles Nelson, who also owned 134, 136, and 172 Second Avenue. In 1908, the drug firm Berry and Demoville occupied the building.  The C.B. Pearce &amp; Co. building, located at 172 Second Avenue, is a three-story, Italianate style brick building with one bay. The fa&#231;ade has brick corbeling and a cornice with brackets and endcaps near the roofline.

Heart owned the lot from 1866-1889 before Charles&#8217;s Nelson (owner of 134-136 Second Avenue) purchased it. The building was likely constructed around 1885, before the property transfer. Liquor dealers C.B. Pearce &amp; Co. began leasing the space in 1890.
