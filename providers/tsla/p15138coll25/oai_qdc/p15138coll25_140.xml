<dc:description>Physician and author (Annals of Tennessee, 1854). This physician, banker, public servant, religious leader, and historian authored a seminal account of early Tennessee history in 1853, The Annals of Tennessee.&#160; This work placed an emphasis on the State of Franklin.&#160; Ramsey's father, Colonel Francis A. Ramsey, had been involved in the formation of the State of Franklin and had served as Clerk of the convention (Greeneville or Houston Convention) that had produced the rejected "Constitution of the Commonwealth of Frankland."As a founder and perpetual corresponding secretary of the East Tennessee Historical and Antiquarian Society and in the course of his research for The Annals, Ramsey accumulated numerous original documents dealing with the history of the State of Franklin that he stored at Mecklenburg, his family home outside of Knoxville. Ramsey's noted Confederate sympathies, and perhaps his feud with Parson William Brownlow, resulted in the burning of his Mecklenburg property upon Union occupation of Knoxville in September of 1863. Thus, a huge cache of documents from the State of Franklin were destroyed or stolen with this act and lost to history. In his autobiography, Ramsey indicated that it was his understanding that&#160;Reverend Samuel Houston, a major figure in the State of Franklin, obtained the bulk of the State of Franklin records.&#160; </dc:description>
