<dc:description>The Hooper Building, located at 128-130 Second Avenue, was a three-story, commercial-style brick building constructed in 1924 by John M. Hooper. Starting in 1908, the Hooper Grocery Company began leasing the buildings at 129, 130, and 131 Second Avenue as their headquarters. The business was formerly located at 135 Second Avenue and moved due to the need to expand. A fire in October of 1923 amounted to $325,000 of damage to the business and other buildings surrounding it. The company was able to move back to the building in 1924. Significant alterations were made to the building over the years, with much of it demolished in 1994. The T.M. DeMoss &amp; Sons building, located at 126 Second Avenue, was a three-story, Italianate style building constructed in 1879. A central parapet on the building is dated 1879. Heavy brackets support the cornice. The center bay of the three bays projects out and with brick corbelling on the second and third story. The arched second-story and third-story windows above the central bay each have a keystone accompanied by natural stones. T.M. DeMoss &amp; Sons moved into the building in 1938.</dc:description>
