<dc:title>Morgan &amp; Hamilton and American Paper Box Manufacturing Company</dc:title>
<dc:description>Businesses on Church Street near Second Avenue North in Nashville, including American Paper Box Manufacturing Company, at 88 Church Street, and Morgan &amp; Hamilton, at 86 Church Street. The businesses are located in a three-story brick building. The building has an overhanging cornice supported by paired brackets and a parapet. The facade features brick corbelling.  The windows on the two upper floors have pointed hoods with central decoration and shoulders. A sign hanging from the building advertises burlap bags. A horse and wagon are parked on the street in front of the building. Several people are on the sidewalk.</dc:description>
<dc:description>In the 1880's Morgan &amp; Hamilton was located on Church Street, but in later years, the Morgan &amp; Hamilton Company existed at several different Market Street locations, including 162 Market Street and 174 North Market Street. The company was the largest manufacturer of bags in the South, including bags used for flour, rice, fertilizer, and more. Their plants in Nashville employed more than 500 people. A report from 1901 by the surveyor of customs stated that the company received some of the largest shipments at the Nashville port entry, with Morgan &amp; Hamilton importing 150,000 yards of burlap from Calcutta, India. Although the company moved the plant closer to the manufacturing district in 1901, they maintained their offices and wareroom at their Market Street location.</dc:description>
