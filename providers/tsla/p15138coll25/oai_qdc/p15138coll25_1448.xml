<dc:description>Nashville&#8217;s early trading and manufacturing ventures are associated with Second Avenue (originally Market Street before a name change in 1904).  Access to the Cumberland River and railroads made the location ideal for a business district. Many merchants and manufacturers used First and Second Avenue for their storehouses and warehouses. Occupants of the street came from all industries. The buildings on Second Avenue are representative of the transition in the late 19the century to brick buildings with significant architectural ornamentation. </dc:description>
