<dc:description>The H. G. Lipscomb &amp; Co. building, located at 138 and 142 Second Avenue, was a five-story Italianate style brick building completed in 1895. It had three large brackets to support the overhanging cornice. The two bays at the front are recessed.  The windows on the upper floors have limestone arches and lintels. The building has had substantial changes, including to the storefront and rooftop.    The Charles Nelson &amp; Co. building, located at 134-136 Second Avenue, is an Italianate style three-story brick building constructed sometime after 1890. Brackets support the overhanging cornice. The fa&#231;ade includes Doric pilasters, modillions, and decorative egg-and-tongue motif molding. Prominent distiller Charles Nelson purchased the property in 1888, and he designed the building to meet his needs as a liquor distributor. The building housed Chas. Nelson &amp; Co.  Greenbrier Distillery, Wholesale Whiskies &amp; Fruit Brandies until 1909. Other occupants of the 134-136 Second Avenue building include Southern Woodenware &amp; Hardware Co. and H.G. Lipscomb.   The Dudley Bros. &amp; Lipscomb Hardware Co. building, located at 132 Second Avenue, is an Italianate style three-story brick building constructed around 1890. The building has a dentilled cornice, corner pilasters, and a limestone stringcourse. The window fenestration includes segmented brick arches. According to earlier images of the building, the structure next door was identical to the building at 132 and belonged to the company at the time. Dudley Brothers &amp; Lipscomb Hardware Co. was the successor to Dodd, Dudley &amp; Lipscomb Co., which had been founded in 1883 and located on Broad Street. The new company moved from that location to 132 Second Avenue in 1888. The firm became Dudley Bros. after Horace Lipscomb left in 1890 to start his own business. Previous occupants of the 132 Second Avenue building include Parlin &amp; Orendorff Co., Nashville Produce Co., Nashville Spring &amp; Mattress Co., and W. T. Jordan &amp; Sons.</dc:description>
