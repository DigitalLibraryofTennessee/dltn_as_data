<dc:title>Dale Hollow Powerhouse</dc:title>
<dc:description>Exterior view of Dale Hollow Powerhouse and Dam. Several cars are parked in the parking lot in front of the building. Caption reads: "The powerhouse houses two 18,000 KW generators with an estimated annual energy output of 120,000 kilowatt hours."</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Flood Control Act of 1938, as well as the River and Harbor Act of 1946, authorized the Dale Hollow Dam and Lake project. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers designed the project, and the construction was supervised by them. In 1943, the flood control portion of the project was completed, and the power-generating units were added later in 1948, 1949, and 1953. At present, the Nashville District of the Corps of Engineers operates the dam, reservoir, and plant.</dc:description>
