<dc:description>The T.M. DeMoss &amp; Sons building, located at 126 Second Avenue, was a three-story, Italianate style building constructed in 1879. A central parapet on the building is dated 1879. Heavy brackets support the cornice. The center bay of the three bays projects out and with brick corbelling on the second and third story. The arched second-story and third-story windows above the central bay each have a keystone accompanied by natural stones. T.M. DeMoss &amp; Sons moved into the building in 1938.  The building located at 120-124 Second Avenue, was a three-story brick building constructed in the 1920&#8217;s. The American Paper &amp; Twine Co. formally opened their new headquarters at the building in 1937. The building was razed in 1993 to construct Opryland&#8217;s Wildhorse Saloon. The building located at 116-118 Second Avenue at the time was a three-story brick building. The second and third floors feature brick corbelling. The building has a mixture of rectangular and arched windows on the upper floors. Brick pilasters divide the areas between windows. The property where these buildings were located was originally purchased in 1869 by Daniel F. Carter and was passed down in their family until Rachel Craighead, his daughter, sold it in 1923. The building's construction occurred between 1888-1902, during the time that C.A. Litterer &amp; Co. occupied the building. Some of the businesses located at 116-118 Second Avenue over the years include L.P. Hope and Co., Vogley &amp; Todd&#8217;s Shop, and Nashville Dairy Supply Co. The original building was torn down in 1994 to construct Opryland&#8217;s Wildhorse Saloon. </dc:description>
