<dc:description>Cleveland Hall, a brick Federal-style home, was built between 1839 to 1840 by Stockley Donelson (a descendant of Colonel John Donelson and nephew of Rachel Jackson). The home was designed by Joseph Reiff and William C. Hume, who had previously built the hermitage. The Donelson family were some of the earliest settlers in middle Tennessee. Stockley, a lawyer and planter, was friends with Andrew Jackson and helped with his business affairs. Additionally, Andrew Jackson was a frequent visitor of Cleveland Hall.</dc:description>
