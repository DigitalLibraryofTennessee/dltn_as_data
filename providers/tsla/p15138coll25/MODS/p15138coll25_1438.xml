  <abstract>View from the street of the Silver Dollar Saloon in the V.E. Schwab Building on Broadway and Second Avenue. A for-lease sign is hanging in one of the windows. An arrow pointing to the entrance is painted on one exterior wall. The Phillip &amp; Quarles Hardware store, located in the Watkins Block, is to the left of Silver Dollar Saloon. A parking lot separates the two buildings. A train car is visible in the background.</abstract>
  <abstract>The Silver Dollar Saloon, located at 100 Market Street (Second Avenue), is a three-story Romanesque brick building designed by architect Julius G. Zwicker and completed in 1893. In 1889, V. E. Schwab purchased the property at Broad and Market Street. The building has terra cotta details, including a wreath and shells on the fa√ßade. A turret is above the main entrance to the building. Other architectural details include a large cornice with a terracotta frieze, stringcourse molding, and large encased arched windows on the second floor. The building's name came from the floors made of silver dollars. V. E. Schwab was associated with George A. Dickel &amp; Co., as his brother-in-law was George A. Dickel, and the saloon served their whiskey. The saloon attracted riverboat crews who worked nearby, with it offering drinks, lunch, and lodging. During prohibition, the saloon transformed into a soft drink emporium and restaurant.</abstract>
