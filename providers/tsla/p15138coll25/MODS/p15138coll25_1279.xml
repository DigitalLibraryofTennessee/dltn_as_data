  <abstract>Black and white photograph taken in Chattanooga showing First Western and Atlantic Depot on 6th Street, Union Depot, Crutchfield House (in front of depot), First Presbyterian Church, Army convalescent hospitals along ridge (now East Terrace), St. Paul's Episcopal Church at 8th and Chestnut Street, and various other buildings.</abstract>
  <abstract>Slaves built the Union Depot in Chattanooga (also known as Chattanooga Union Station) between 1857-1859, and during the Civil War, the train card shed was used as an army hospital. In 1861, it was used as a hospital by Maj. Charles Anderson as a Confederate hospital, but was later used by Union Troops as a hospital. It later displayed the "General," Western and Atlantic's locomotive that was associated with the Great Locomotive Chase that involved Union raiders. The original Crutchfield House (predecessor to The Read House Hotel) was built by Thomas Crutchfield from 1847-1848 and was the site of an incident between Jefferson Davis and William Crutchfield. St. Paul's Episcopal Church and First Presbyterian Church also served as military hospitals during the Civil War.</abstract>
