  <abstract>Exterior photograph of Washington Manufacturing Company brick building at the corner of Second Avenue and Commerce Street. A sign attached to the building says "Home of Washington "Dee Cee" Sportswear." Cars and people are in front of the entrance.</abstract>
  <abstract>The Washington Manufacturing Co., consisting of 222, 224, 226, and 228 Second Avenue, includes numerous buildings ranging in styles and construction time despite appearing to be one building. The building at 222 Second Avenue was a five-story, Italianate style brick building built around 1878. 224 Second Avenue was a five-story commercial building constructed in 1885. The property at 226 Second Avenue was a five-story commercial style building built around 1890. Located on the corner, the building at 228 Second Avenue was estimated to be built in 1885. The design, influenced by Renaissance Revival and Richardsonian Romanesque architecture, has been attributed to Jul. G. Zwicker, who was the architect of the Silver Dollar Saloon. The building has a mansard roof, and many parts of the facade, such as the cornice, pediment, and moldings, are made from terra cotta. Brandon Printing Co., one of the largest publishing houses, occupied the building at 228 by 1892, purchasing the properties of 224 and 226 in later years during the company's expansion. The Washington Manufacturing Company began to occupy the space in 1939, buying the entire block by 1963.</abstract>
