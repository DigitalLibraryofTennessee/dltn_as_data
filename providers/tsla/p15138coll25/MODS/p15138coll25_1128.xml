  <abstract>Exterior view of the stone Cumberland County Courthouse. The two-story building made from crab orchard stone has a bracketed cornice, pediment, and square vented turret with a pyramidal spire.</abstract>
  <abstract>The second courthouse, completed in 1886 for a total of $5,200, was designed by Knoxville architect J.F. Bowman and constructed by D.G. Brown (contractor), W.J. McGuire (Stone Mason), Lew Bennett (Stone Mason), and W.J. Andrews (Carpenter). In 1905, parts of the building were destroyed in a fire. A new courthouse replaced it. After it was repaired from the fire damage, it served as a school from 1908-1929.</abstract>
