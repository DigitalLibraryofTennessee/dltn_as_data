  <abstract>View of the Watson House Building on Market Street (Second Avenue) with horse carts on the dirt road in front of it. The name of the building is above the entrance and is also painted on the side of the balcony. The building on the direct right is a wholesale grocer. The building on the direct left of Watson House advertises furnishings, boots, and shoes. A sign for S.A.G. Noel &amp; Co. is visible in the background. The signs for businesses across the street from Watson House include the Barberâ€™s Shop and Bathing Salon at 21 Market Street and clothier Sternfield &amp; Erdman. The display in front of the Sternfield &amp; Erdman storefront includes a jacket and scarf.</abstract>
  <abstract>The Watson House, operated by proprietor Thos. S. Watson, was a first-class hotel located at 20 Market Street, near Public Square and Union Street. The three-story brick building had a flat roof. Each of the upper floors had balconies facing the street. In the 1850s, the hotel was renovated and refurnished, with the board rates in 1858 being $1.50 per day or $8.50 per week. During the Civil War, Union forces occupied the Watson House, and the building was used in connection with Hospital No. 19 (currently 210-212 Second Avenue). Union forces also occupied other nearby buildings on the street.</abstract>
