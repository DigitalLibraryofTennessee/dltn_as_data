  <abstract>View from the south of Second Avenue, showing businesses. Signs on buildings for businesses include McCormick Deering Farm Machine Co., Nashville Store Fixture Co., Tennessee Salvage Co., Nashville Store Fixture Co., and the Tennessee Glass Co. Several cars are driving down the street, and there are cars and delivery trucks parked on both sides of the street. A work truck for Tennessee Glass Co. is parked in front of the storefront, located at 184 Second Avenue. A stop sign at the intersection has Church Street labeled.</abstract>
  <abstract>Nashvilleâ€™s early trading and manufacturing ventures are associated with Second Avenue (originally Market Street before a name change in 1904). Access to the Cumberland River and railroads made the location ideal for a business district. Many merchants and manufacturers used First and Second Avenue for their storehouses and warehouses. Occupants of the street came from all industries. The buildings on Second Avenue are representative of the transition in the late 19th century to brick buildings with significant architectural ornamentation.</abstract>
