  <abstract>Exterior view of Poston Building at the corner of Main Street and Telegraph Street showing the rectangular block of three buildings. The building has three front bays on the first floor. Wooden columns, a continuous wooden lintel, transom windows, and sets of double wooden doors are located at the openings to the building. The fire walls between each building extend past the roof. A stairway to the rear facade is in the background. A sign on the building advertises the Torino Cigar Company.</abstract>
  <abstract>The block of three buildings was erected by John H. Poston in 1843, and are the oldest business buildings in Montgomery County. The architectural style of the building is similar to Philadelphia's stores from that time period. In 1973, a fire occurred in the Torino Cigar Co. part of the building.</abstract>
