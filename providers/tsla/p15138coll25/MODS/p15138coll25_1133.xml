  <abstract>View of the front and side of Crutchfield House, post headquarters and hospital during the Civil War, and railroad depot in Chattanooga.</abstract>
  <abstract>Slaves built the Union Depot in Chattanooga (also known as Chattanooga Union Station) between 1857-1859, and during the Civil War, the train card shed was used as an army hospital. In 1861, it was used as a hospital by Maj. Charles Anderson as a Confederate hospital, but was later used by Union Troops as a hospital. The original Crutchfield House (predecessor to The Read House Hotel) was built by Thomas Crutchfield from 1847-1848 and was the site of an incident between Jefferson Davis and William Crutchfield.</abstract>
