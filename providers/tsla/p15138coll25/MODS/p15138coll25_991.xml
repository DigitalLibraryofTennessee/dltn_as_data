  <abstract>Interior view of Ma's Room, "Elizabeth Boddie Elliston's Room," at Burlington. A woman is seated in a rocking chair in front of the fireplace. A portrait is hanging over the fireplace.</abstract>
  <abstract>Joseph T. Elliston, the fourth mayor of Nashville, purchased 208 acres in mid-town (near modern-day Centennial Park and Vanderbilt) in 1811. He served on the committee that made the decision to use William Strickland as the architect for the Tennessee State Capitol. William Strickland was the architect for the Burlington home which was built in the Italian Renaissance style. In 1932, the home was razed so that space could be made on Elliston Place for Father Ryan High School.</abstract>
