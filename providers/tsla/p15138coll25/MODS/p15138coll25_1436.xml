  <abstract>Exterior view of Max Schatten &amp; Son Wholesale Shoes on Second Avenue. Signs for the business advertise wholesale shoes, rejects, samples, job lots, factory returns, and ladies handbags. Windows on the second-story and third-story have "fire dept." written on them.</abstract>
  <abstract>The building located at 116-118 Second Avenue at the time was a three-story brick building. The second and third floors feature brick corbelling. The building has a mixture of rectangular and arched windows on the upper floors. Brick pilasters divide the areas between windows. The property where these buildings were located was originally purchased in 1869 by Daniel F. Carter and was passed down in their family until Rachel Craighead, his daughter, sold it in 1923. The building's construction would have occurred between 1888-1902, during the time that C.A. Litterer &amp; Co. occupied the building. Some of the businesses located at 116-118 Second Avenue over the years include L.P. Hope and Co., Vogley &amp; Toddâ€™s Shop, and Nashville Dairy Supply Co. In 1994, two of the buildings were torn down to construct the Wild Horse Saloon at 116 and 118 Second Avenue.</abstract>
