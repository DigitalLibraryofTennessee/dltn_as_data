  <abstract>The Drouillard/Nashville Paper Stock Co. building, located at 182 Second Avenue, is a three-story brick Italianate style building constructed in the 1890's for James P. Drouillard. The bottom floor consists of two bays with the storefront featuring a decorative transom area and metal paneling. The building has a patterned cornice and cast-iron Corinthian columns. The four windows on the upper floors have limestone sills, keystones, limestone stone caps, and brick archways. Early Occupants of the building include the Kemker-Woolwine Candy and Cracker Co., John Deere Plow Co., and Parris Manufacturing Co. The Nashville Paper Stock Co. purchased the property in 1922 and operated it for many years. Previous addresses for the building include 8 South Market Street. The building at 178-180 Second Avenue was a four-story brick commercial style building constructed around the 1930’s. The building has pilasters, and stringcourses are located on each floor of the façade. The prior building located on the property was occupied by grocer R.F. Weakley &amp; Co., wholesale grocers Hibbett, Gentry &amp; Co., and harness factory Montgomery-Moore Manufacturing Co. in the early 1900’s. A description of the former building from when Montgomery-Moore Manufacturing Co. occupied it states the building was a six-floor building that was one of the largest on the block. Former occupants of the current building include McWhorter, Weaver &amp; Co., who started leasing the property in 1922, Music City Manufacturing, and Nashville China &amp; Equipment Co. The building located at 176 Second Avenue is a four-story, Italianate-style brick building constructed around 1875. Properties 174 and 176 are nearly identical in construction, with one of the main differences being the arched windows at 176 Second Avenue. Both buildings have similar arched parapets, corbeled brick, window molding, pilasters, stringcourses, and large cornices. The Orr Bros. owned the building from 1876 through 1880, with Robert Orr and family associated with it from 1881 through 1951. In 1890, the building was occupied by Orr, Jackson and Co., a wholesale grocery firm. The company occupied the entire building, utilizing the third-story operating as a factory in 1908 to produce extracts such as O.J. No. 11. Previous addresses for the building include 42, 58, and 60 South Market Street.</abstract>
