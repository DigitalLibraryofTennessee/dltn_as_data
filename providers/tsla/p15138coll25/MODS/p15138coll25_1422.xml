  <abstract>The Pilcher Building, located at 144 and 146 Second Avenue, was constructed in 1902 for Andrew Pilcher. At the time, it served as his offices and grain business. The building is a four-story, commercial-style brick building with two bays. Three brackets support the cornice. A stone inset on the exterior reads “Pilcher.” On July 6, 1905, the building suffered from a fire and required rebuilding. The damage from the fire amounted to a loss of around $146,000. Occupants have included: Phillips, Webb &amp; Co., Smith, Herrin &amp; Baird Mfg. Co, M. E. Derryberry &amp; Co., and Jones &amp; Hopkins Mfg. Co. The H. G. Lipscomb &amp; Co. building, located at 138 and 142 Second Avenue, was a five-story Italianate style brick building completed in 1895. It had three large brackets to support the overhanging cornice. The two bays at the front are recessed. The windows on the upper floors have limestone arches and lintels. The building has had substantial changes, including to the storefront and rooftop.</abstract>
