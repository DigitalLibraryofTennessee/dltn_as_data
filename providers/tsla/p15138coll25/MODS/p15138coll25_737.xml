  <abstract>Aerial view of Boscobel Heights for the Nashville Housing Authority.</abstract>
  <abstract>The passage of the first United States Housing Act in 1937 influenced Nashville to begin work on addressing the housing crisis through establishing a municipal housing authority. By late 1938, the Nashville Housing Authority was formed after approval by the City Council. The application for Boscobel Heights, later renamed as James A. Cayce Homes, was submitted in May of 1939 to the U.S. Housing Authority. The 386 units Cayce Homes was comprised of were designed by Marr &amp; Holman. Construction spanned from 1939-1941, and in 1941 the first occupants moved in.</abstract>
