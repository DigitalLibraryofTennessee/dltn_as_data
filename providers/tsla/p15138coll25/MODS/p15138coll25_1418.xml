  <abstract>View of the exterior of apartments at 174-176 Second Avenue. One of the buildings has a fire escape. Several cars are parked in front of the building, and a person is opening the door of a van. A no parking sign is posted on the sidewalk. One of the windows is open on the second floor, and a sign in a third-floor window reads “fire dept.” Part of the building at 172 Second Avenue is visible to the right.</abstract>
  <abstract>The building located at 176 Second Avenue is a four-story, Italianate-style brick building constructed around 1875. Properties 174 and 176 are nearly identical in construction, with one of the main differences being the arched windows at 176 Second Avenue. Both buildings have similar arched parapets, corbeled brick, window molding, pilasters, stringcourses, and large cornices. The Orr Bros. owned the building from 1876 through 1880, with Robert Orr and family associated with it from 1881 through 1951. In 1890, the building was occupied by Orr, Jackson and Co., a wholesale grocery firm. The company occupied the entire building, utilizing the third-story operating as a factory in 1908 to produce extracts such as O.J. No. 11. Previous addresses for the building include 42, 58, and 60 South Market Street. The Berry &amp; Demoville building, located at 174 Second Avenue, is a four-story, Italianate style brick building constructed around 1875. The building has an arched parapet, corbeled brick, and cornice supported by brackets around the roof area. The top of each window has detailed stone hood molding. The metal cornice above the storefront has elaborate end caps and decorative medallions. The property was owned by Charles Nelson, who also owned 134, 136, and 172 Second Avenue. In 1908, the drug firm Berry and Demoville occupied the building. The C.B. Pearce &amp; Co. building, located at 172 Second Avenue, is a three-story, Italianate style brick building with one bay. The façade has brick corbeling and a cornice with brackets and endcaps near the roofline. The second and third-story rounded windows have Italianate style molding around and arched stone sills with keystones. John S. Heart owned the lot from 1866-1889 before Charles Nelson (owner of 134-136 Second Avenue) purchased it. The building was likely constructed around 1885, before the property transfer. Liquor dealers C.B. Pearce &amp; Co. began leasing the space in 1890.</abstract>
