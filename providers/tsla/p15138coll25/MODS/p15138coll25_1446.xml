  <abstract>View of Minton &amp; Cooper Wholesale Tinware at 22 Market Street North (now Second Avenue North). Several men are standing around the building and in front of the second-story and third-story windows. A horse-drawn Minton &amp; Cooper cart in front of the building. The top of the building has the words "stove &amp; tinware" on it. The advertisement painted on the building's side is for wholesale tinware, cooking and heating stoves, wood stoves, Lady Gay stoves, mantles, and grates.</abstract>
  <abstract>Minton &amp; Cooper were the sole agents in the city to carry Lady Gay and Active stoves. Advertisements by Minton &amp; Cooper in 1876 presented the idea that anyone interested in buying the product should come into the store to see it before buying a stove sight unseen. In 1877, the partnership between J. E. Minton and Geo. E. Cooper was dissolved in, with Geo. E. Cooper taking sole ownership of the 22 North Market St. location while J. E. Minton still worked as a salesman for the business. In 1881, J. E. Minton received a permit to build a store-house and residence located down the street at 188 South Market Street for $3,100.</abstract>
