  <abstract>Engine House No. 6 is a two-story brick building located on South Market Street, around Elm Street, at what is now 629 Second Avenue. Engine Company No. 6 was first organized in 1860, making it one of Nashville's earliest engine companies. The company's name changed several times before it was named the James Geddes Engine Company No. 6 in 1887. The Engine House No. 6 was well-known for hosting largely attended Fourth of July barbeques at their Market Street location.</abstract>
