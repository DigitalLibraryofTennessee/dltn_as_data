  <abstract>Belle Meade Plantation was founded in 1807 by John Harding, and over time the size of the plantation grew. His son, General William G. Harding, managed it from 1839-1883. During that time, he was imprisoned by Civil War Federal authorities for six months, and Elizabeth McGavock Harding, his wife, managed the plantation. The plantation was well known for its thoroughbred breeding farm both before and after the Civil War. By the 1880s and 1890s it became a destination for visitors.</abstract>
