  <abstract>The Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park, the first and largest military park in the United States, is located at the Civil War battle sites for the Battle of Chickamauga and the Siege of Chattanooga. The park was established in 1890 to preserve the sites of military maneuvers and to also hold monuments and memorials to military organizations as well as states whose troops participated in fights at the location. The formal dedication of the park took place in 1895. The New York monument is the largest monument at the park and was completed in 1910.</abstract>
