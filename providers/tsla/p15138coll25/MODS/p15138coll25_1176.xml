  <abstract>Exterior view of the front and end of Cragfont looking northwest. The two-story home is constructed of Tennessee limestone. The home has several large iron stars attached through iron rods, barred cellar windows, double hung windows, and windows above the door. The wooden cornice, with modillions and billet molding, runs along the facade. It has chimneys at both ends of the house. All of the windows and doorway have decorative stonework surrounding them. A wooden, two-story porch is in the background.</abstract>
  <abstract>The late Georgian style home was built between 1798 and 1802, and was originally home of General James Winchester. It was named after the Rocky Bluff it is located on. Cragfont was occupied by the Winchester family until 1864.</abstract>
