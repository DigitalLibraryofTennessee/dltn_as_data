<dc:title>Tah-Chee</dc:title>
<dc:description>Portrait of Cherokee leader Tah-Chee shown wearing a lavender tunic with a dagger tucked into a green sash belted around the waist. His headdress is topped with a large red feather.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Tah-Chee (the Cherokee word for "Dutch") was born circa 1790 in present-day Alabama but became one of the earliest Cherokees to remove west of the Mississippi, settling south of the Arkansas River. He led a renegade band of Cherokees intent on resisting Federal authority and warring on neighboring tribes, particularly the Osages. He later became a valuable guide and hunter for the government, attending the 1835 CampHomes Treaty. He later settled in Texas until he was forcibly relocated to Oklahoma, where he died in 1848.</dc:description>
