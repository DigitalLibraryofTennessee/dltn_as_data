      <title>Women in the Civil War</title>
    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>The 150th anniversary of the Civil War offers an extended opportunity for commemorating all aspects of a period that is central to American history. The stories of women in the Civil War are perhaps even more varied than those of the men who served on the front lines. Females of all classes experienced the war in some way, whether through deprivation, loss of loved ones, disintegration of social norms, a renewed sense of patriotism, or, in at least a few hundred documented cases, actual battlefield experience. While the curiosity of women serving on Civil War battlefields has attracted some attention, the women featured here each contributed to the Union or Confederate cause in her own fashion. “Women in the Civil War” digital collection showcases the musings of three affluent Tennesseans who experienced the war just as deeply as the soldiers who fought. Throughout the South, women with Confederate and Union sympathies alike endured a traumatic war just as much as their sons, husbands, and fathers.</abstract>
