<dc:description>Formed August 1, 1861, this Nashville association provided aid to sick and wounded soldiers of Tennessee and the Confederacy. This resolution was unanimously adopted on September 2, 1861, and hints at problems that plagued the association. It faced neglect of procedure, unbridled members, mass resignations, and extensive criticism from the male agent called upon for guidance. The Association and the Soldiers' Relief Society eventually asked for oversight by the Young Men's Christian Association.</dc:description>
