<dc:description>Craighead, an affluent Nashville young woman with Confederate sympathies,  faced the reality of living in occupied Nashville during the Civil War. Born to prominent Nashville banker Daniel F. Carter and Mary J. Buntin Carter in 1837, Rachel Carter married Nashville lawyer Thomas D. Craighead in 1859, and the couple continued to live with her parents at 6th and Union, along with her younger brother John. Wartime brought the death of her brother at Perryville and numerous arrests of her father in Nashville.</dc:description>
