<dc:title>Mrs. Lincoln</dc:title>
<dc:description>Carte de visite of Mary Todd Lincoln. Image appears very similar to photograph taken of her by Matthew B. Brady in his New York, N.Y. studio in 1861. Her head and left arm are in different positions and the chair has been edited out, but the dress and flowers are the same. Her right arm holding the bouquet is also in the same position.

<dc:description>Mary Anne Todd Lincoln (1818-1882) was from a prominent Kentucky family. She married Abraham Lincoln in 1842. She was so deeply traumatized by the assassination of her husband and the deaths of three of her four sons that she began behaving very erratically. As a result, her oldest son, Robert Todd Lincoln, had her committed for insanity in 1875. She is buried with her husband in the Lincoln Tomb, Oak Ridge Cemetery, Springfield, Illinois.</dc:description>
