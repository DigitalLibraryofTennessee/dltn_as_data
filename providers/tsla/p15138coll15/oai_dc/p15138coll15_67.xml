<dc:description>The Confederate cemetery located at ""Carnton,"" in Franklin, Tennessee. When John and Carrie McGavock lived in the home in 1864, it served as a field hospital during the Battle of Franklin. After the war, in 1866, the McGavocks set aside two acres of land on the property so that 1,500 Confederate soldiers could be reinterred there.  This cemetery is the largest privately held Confederate cemetery in the United States. Soldiers from all Confederate states, except Virginia, are buried in the cemetery.</dc:description>
