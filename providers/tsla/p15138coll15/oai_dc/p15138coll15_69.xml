<dc:description>This is the oldest church in Dayton. During the Civil War, it was used to incarcerate women accused of being spies, sometimes referred to as the ""Rhea County Spartans."" They were held in the church, then transported to Chattanooga where they were released upon their promise to disband and cease activity.  The building burned at an unknown date after November 29, 1885, and was replaced. See Bettye J. Broyles' Churches and Schools of Rhea County, Tennessee (F443 .R4 B74) p. 105-106.</dc:description>
