<dc:description>Carnton, built largely in the Greek Revival style, was a profitable, large-scale farming operation established in 1826 by former mayor of Nashville, Randal McGavock. When John and Carrie McGavock lived in the home in 1864 during the Battle of Franklin, it served as the largest field hospital in the area. Following the Battle of Franklin, the bodies of four dead Confederate generals--Patrick Cleburne, John Adams, Otho F. Stahl and Hiram B. Granbury--lay on Carntons back porch for a few hours.</dc:description>
