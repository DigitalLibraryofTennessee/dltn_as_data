<dc:description>In 1922, 125 acres in south Knoxville (the Dickinson estate in Island Home Park) was acquired to be the new home of the Tennessee School for the Deaf.  Marr &amp; Holman, a prominent Nashville architectural firm, was hired to design the new campus buildings.;  (Thomas S. Marr  had attended the Tennessee School for the Deaf from 1877 to 1884.)  In 1926 this dormitory building was added.  The contractor was V. L. Nicholson. Other structures would follow and expand the campus.</dc:description>
