<dc:description>The Negro Department at the Tennessee School for the Deaf was established in 1881.  It secured a permanent location in 1885 with the purchase of the Abner G. Jackson home on Dandridge Pike.  Radical improvements took place in 1940, when a cement block extension was added to the main building.  That addition, pictured here, contained an auditorium, classrooms, a domestic arts department, a shop, and the central heating plant. Principal Henry C. Edmunds helped with the construction.</dc:description>
