<dc:description>The Tennessee School for the Deaf (originally called the Tennessee School for the Deaf &amp; Dumb or the Deaf &amp; Dumb Asylum) was authorized by the state in 1844, following legislative efforts intiated by Sen. John Cocke of Grainger County. Merchant Calvin Morgan donated the property for the school, and construction began in 1846. The school's original location was known as "Old City Hall."  In 1925 the school moved to its present 96-acre campus on the banks of the Tennessee River.</dc:description>
