<dc:description>The Athletic Association of the Tennessee School for the Deaf revived an extant Bus Fund in the fall of 1938 and began seriously raising money to purchase a bus for the use of the athletic teams.  The committee heading up this effort was composed of Chairman Conley Akin, Publicity Chariman J.M. Smith, Jr., and Treasurer Harley Bishop. Alumni, pupils, teachers, and friends contributed.  The institution received their bus in the fall of 1940.</dc:description>
