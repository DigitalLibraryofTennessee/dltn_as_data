<dc:description>The home was built as a summer home for Col. Perez Dickinson's bride, Susan Penniman, in 1846.  President Rutherford B. Hayes was a house guest there in 1877. The building was originally located on Col. Dickinson's 600-acre scientific farm overlooking the Holston River.  The state bought 125 acres of the Dickinson property in 1922 as the site for the Tennessee School for the Deaf.  The house has been used as the Superintendent's Residence since 1924.</dc:description>
