Included are the Belmont Theater, Sulphur Dell baseball park, Nashville Post Office (now the Frist Center for the Visual Arts), Tennessee Home for Feeble Minded Persons, and Tennessee School for the Deaf. The School for the Deaf held special significance for Thomas Scott Marr since he was himself deaf.</dc:description>
