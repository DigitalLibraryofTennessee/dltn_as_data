  <abstract>J. S. Burrow writes his brother from Chester County detailing his financial problems, his inability to collect money until cotton comes to market, his desire to move from Jacks Creek for better money-making opportunities, and his fear that he will eventually have to enter military service. He contends General Pillow will re-take Ft. Henry if he can muster enough troops. He notes that unconfirmed rumors state Pillow has whipped the enemy at Fort Donelson.</abstract>

These sources can offer the public a lens into the lives of many Civil War non-combatant men and women, a subject of increasing importance in Civil War scholarship...</abstract>
