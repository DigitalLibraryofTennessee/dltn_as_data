  <abstract>[Page 1] “Bells Bridge July 29th /63 Dear Pa Your letter came to hand a few days since without date I was glad to hear from home and to hear that Rob had been there also to hear that Col Fain had taken Command of his regt again I think Rob will get along better but I was sorry to hear that Capt Brittain had resigned for I think Rob would get allong better with Fulkerson as first Lt than as Captain I read a letter from Rob the same day with yours He says that you are talking of moving into Georgia and he thinks it would suit you very well and I am of the same opinion for I think it is most too confining for you to stay in the store, any how while the weather is so warm and I think you can get along without working so hard and I think you &amp; Ma have done enough to rest a while. And I think “ [Page 2] “could get a house to live in in Georgia it would suit you better than to live in Cleveland though I do not know how you &amp; Ma would get along without some Daily paper to read you could buy you a pony and let Willy ride to the depot for your mail I would like verry much to be at home &amp; see some of the men from Vicksburg &amp; hear their account of the fight. I see that Vaughns Brigade is to stay in this department and I suppose they will see an easier time than at Vicksburg except the marching part off it. We are still resting at this place and I havent any idea how long we will remain here One of the regts belonging to Frazers Brigade has just come in it has been stationed at Knoxville ever since we went to Chattanooga the Brigade is at this time all together except one of our Companies at Strawberry Plaines though I understand” [Page 3] “that it will be here in day or two I have been trying to get to go to the Plaines so that I could get to see Rob I have failed so far, but I may succeed yet. Col Allen came to see me yesterday and returned to Knoxville to day. I never saw a set of men as well pleased as the men of this regt was when they saw him riding up His time of suspension will be out the 31st of this month and he says he will take command of the regt Then the rest of the officers have not been restored yet, and I think they will not be soon I have a notion of changing my position in the regt from Ord Sergt. to Waggon Master. The place of Ordnance Sergt does not pay me enough for the responsibility I have &amp; the other place will pay me the same and will have no responsibility besides I am furnished with a horse to ride” [Page 4] “and can have a great deal more privilages Can go &amp; come when I please. I did not write to you any thing about my arm in my other letters. I tried the medicine which Dr. Ford gave me and I think that it healed the sore up too sudently and caused it to break out [under?] my arm. And it makes a verry sore place &amp; keeps me from doing any duty I am in hopes it will be well before we have to make another march I tried to get a furlough home until my arm got well but could not get it unless I would go to the hospittal at Knoxville &amp; I would not do that I could get to go to the country and stay a week or two if I chose but I believe I will not do it unless I get worse that I am now. I have written this letter for you &amp; Ophelia both excuse my writing as I have to write on a board &amp; that on my knee. Write to me soon Your son Gamble”</abstract>

    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>The items in this collection offer new perspectives into the lives of numerous non-combatants during the Civil War in Tennessee and throughout the southeast.  The correspondence and primary writings touch on several themes relating to the home front, including the diverse roles of women, the relationship between occupying/invading forces and civilians, personal beliefs regarding secession and the war, and the effect of the war on African American Tennesseans.  These sources can offer the public a lens into the lives of many Civil War non-combatant men and women, a subject of increasing importance in Civil War scholarship...</abstract>
