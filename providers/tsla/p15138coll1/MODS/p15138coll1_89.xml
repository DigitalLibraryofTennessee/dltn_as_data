  <abstract>“January 25th, 1863 Dear Tommie Having an opportunity of sending you a letter I write you [a few?] lines knowing that you are always anxious to hear from home. I have just returned from the hospital in Columbia. I have a room there and went in to see about my patients. There is a great many sick soldiers there. Some that have their hands frost biten. [sic] They are mostly Forest’s men. I heard in town today that they were expecting the Yankees in Franklin. Whether it be true or not I can’t tell but hope it is not true for if they get here again they will ruin us. When I see so many soldiers coming home on furlough I think it is right hard that you and Jimmie can’t get home. Mr. Hamilton left last week. He stayed at home longer than he would have done on account of Peter. He was not willing to go south and leave his wife. Your Pa sold him to Mr. Crosby. We have bought Cary Purpose to wait on you. We heard you had three servants in your mess and did not need him but I don’t think it is true. Keep Cary to wait on you if you get sick he can wait on you. Your Ma W. has been very sick with a sore throat. I was in to see her yesterday. She is better. Hew Bradshaw is married. He married the widow Ford. Mr. Woodside was arrested the other day and sent up to Bragg. He has been in Nashville ever since the Yankees left Columbia. He came back the other day and was [paper missing] up as a spy. Report says his sentence is death. Billie is in the drugstore clerking for Bryen. I received your last letter and the papers you sent me. I read them and handed them to Alice as you requested. I would brake up housekeeping if it was not for your uncle Sam and that I expect you boys home some day. Mariah has a fine daughter. She has named it Ella Ford after Dr. Ford of Mt. Pleasant. He and his lady have been up and spent the day. He is an excellent physician. The Legislature of Indiana have met and they won’t vote another dollar nor another man to carry on this war. Report says they have troubles among themselves. Kentucky has sent a petition to Lincoln if he does not repeal his emancipation bill she will secede. There were [paper missing] of Forest’s men froze to death the last cold spell we had. I suppose they were neglected while standing picket. I hope the Lord will protect you and spare you to return home again. Give my love to Jimmie. Tell him to write me. Jennie White sends her love to you and Jimmie. She has come up to stay awhile with me. Write every opportunity you have. Nothing more. Your mother S. A. Hamilton”</abstract>

    <abstract>The items in this collection offer new perspectives into the lives of numerous non-combatants during the Civil War in Tennessee and throughout the southeast.  The correspondence and primary writings touch on several themes relating to the home front, including the diverse roles of women, the relationship between occupying/invading forces and civilians, personal beliefs regarding secession and the war, and the effect of the war on African American Tennesseans.  These sources can offer the public a lens into the lives of many Civil War non-combatant men and women, a subject of increasing importance in Civil War scholarship...</abstract>
