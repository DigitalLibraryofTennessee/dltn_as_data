  <abstract>[Page 1] “Dyersburg Tenn June 28th ‘61 My dear, dear husband, I received your letter by Mr. Watkins – I was just at my breakfast this morning when your last by Maj. Fowlkes came – you may be sure. I made a hasty meal of it - . Your letters are all I look for with any eagerness – not having you to look for. They come nearer supplying your place than any thing else. &amp; you cannot write too often. You must not be disappointed if you do not get one from me by every one passing, for I do not know if their going to Randolph. You know we live so far in the country, we do not hear much that is going on in town. I do not know how I will send [missing] but I must write at [missing] to chance, for an opportunity [missing]” [Page 2] “We are getting along as well &amp; comfortably as usual, and only need your dear presence, to make us happy. But oh! We miss you so much, &amp; my anxiety is so great for you, that you are never one moment from my mind. And though I know God is able to protect you, where ever you are, still I cannot feel that “you will be as safe in the battlefield as in your peaceful home.” My only hope now is, that something will be done in Congress to still the tempest that is now threatening us, before it burst upon us with all its fury, and leaves thousands of hearts and homes desolate. I am rejoiced to hear that you are getting along so pleasantly – for it would be an additional trouble to me to know you were not comfortably situated – I understand that several of your company returned. How were they received: I had just put up my letter to go to the kitchen, &amp; mix” [Page 3] “some light bread to send you, when Mr. Ledsinger drove up to the gate, &amp; I must finish my letter in a hurry to send by him, I leave read to Mary – if it is not so good as I would have made, you will have to excuse it. The uniform will be sent to the river in the morning. &amp; I am sending you a box of edibles – I don’t know that it will be any better than you get. But will show that you are still thought of at home. Father and Mother are still very feeble, but are better than when you left. Johnnies old cough has returned on him. I am very uneasy about it – He is very well with that exception – Katie face appears to be entirely well, but it may break out again at any time. Dr. McGauby requests me to tell you that M. R. Hill is candidate for Congress. Mrs. Barton has got home &amp; brought her eldest sister with her – She is” [Page 4] “such a fine, lively girl, that she will be good company for Cousin Beck – for she can talk equally as fast – I will have to answer all your questions about home in one – every thing is getting along tolerably well. – The weather is so dry that our vegetables are suffering very much. You inquired about your bus. Mr. Howe had just finished taking a box to send you when your letter came. This is the second box that we have taken, it is not so nice as the first. I had intended writing you a good long letter in return for yours on Sunday – but Mr. Ledsinger has spoiled it all - &amp; I am so hurried I hardly know what I am writing. Johnnie send you a kiss – all send their love but accept the warmest, truest love from, Your affectionate wife, Mary G. Latta.”</abstract>

    <abstract>The items in this collection offer new perspectives into the lives of numerous non-combatants during the Civil War in Tennessee and throughout the southeast.  The correspondence and primary writings touch on several themes relating to the home front, including the diverse roles of women, the relationship between occupying/invading forces and civilians, personal beliefs regarding secession and the war, and the effect of the war on African American Tennesseans.  These sources can offer the public a lens into the lives of many Civil War non-combatant men and women, a subject of increasing importance in Civil War scholarship...</abstract>
