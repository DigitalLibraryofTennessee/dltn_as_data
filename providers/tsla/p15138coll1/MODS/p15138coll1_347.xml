  <abstract>“John Thomas Wright being duly sworn testifies as follows: There were two companies of cavalry organized in Lebanon, that became members of the 4th Tenn. Cavalry, commanded by Col. Baxter Smith. Company F was commanded by Capt. J. R. Lester and Company K was commanded by Capt. Jim Britton. I belonged to Company F from its organization until it was paroled by Charlotte, N. C. on May 3, 1865. On the record I made, I am now on the pension roll of Tennessee. Mr. Huse Burke did not belong to either of said companies, nor to the 4th Tenn. Cavalry: However, he had a brother, James Burke who did belong to Company F, and made a gallant soldier, and was killed in a charge at the battle of Chickamauga on September 20, 1863. If Mr. Huse Burke was ever tried or threatened to be tried by a Federal Court martial, it was as a citizen and not as a member of the 4th Tennessee Cavalry. Jno. T. Wright Sworn to before me, this 24 day of February, 1923. [signature] Notary Public”</abstract>

These sources can offer the public a lens into the lives of many Civil War non-combatant men and women, a subject of increasing importance in Civil War scholarship...</abstract>
