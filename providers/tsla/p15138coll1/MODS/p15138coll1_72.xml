  <abstract>“Nov. 8 Columbia Tenn Dear Husband I have just received a letter from you stating that you had never received more than three letters from home since you left. I cannot give any account for you not getting mine when I write every three or four days. I was very glad to hear from you and [illeg] but sorry to learn you would not be at home soon. It was quite a disappointment for I was looking for you very soon. But I had just as well quit looking. For you don’t intend coming home no more it seems. As for the news I can give you a little. All of the Colored Troops have left. Here and there is but very few that are sorry. I think we will get along very well without them. I received a paper last Saturday directed to you with a receipt in it. On opening it I found it was my favorit [sic] paper it was the Metropolitan. I was somewhat lifted up thinking you was not far off and would be at home soon. I have cribed [sic] all of my corn which is about 80 bl: Corn is selling for $8.00 per bl in the field. Polk will be from 15 to 20 cts some are asking 20 cts. Flour is selling for $6.00. You did not speak of Bro Milner’s health. His wife is very uneasy about him and wants him to come home. Cousin Amstead Poke’s gin house was burned and his dwelling was robed the same night. He lost a great deal of cotton and money. Mr. Maxey left last Wednesday. He took both of the girls and Charlie. Although he promised me to bring Charlie back but I don’t know whether he will or not. Jimmie is very anxious to go off and learn a traid [sic]. He is waiting for you to return so he can decide. Mr. Maxey toled [sic] him if he would come down there his board should not cost him anything. We received a letter from Lollie White that use to be and she is now in Lexington, Ky and will be out to see us as soon as she can get rested. John Tyler’s wife is dead. She has been dead 2 years but we never heard it until lately. You must in your next letter write me word what I must do. Whether I must rent out my place or whether I must keep house. I would like very much to know before it gets to [sic] late. The negroes have but all seased [sic] to do any thing for me. Osker and Mariah are still with me yet… You must write soon Your devoted wife S. A. Hamilton P.S. The People here are all dreading an insurrection with the negro S. Ann Hamilton P.S. Tell Tommie I have just received his letter and was very glad to hear from him. Tell him his Ma’ is no better and nor Lou Wilson is no better. I will answer his letter soon.”</abstract>

    <abstract>The items in this collection offer new perspectives into the lives of numerous non-combatants during the Civil War in Tennessee and throughout the southeast.  The correspondence and primary writings touch on several themes relating to the home front, including the diverse roles of women, the relationship between occupying/invading forces and civilians, personal beliefs regarding secession and the war, and the effect of the war on African American Tennesseans.  These sources can offer the public a lens into the lives of many Civil War non-combatant men and women, a subject of increasing importance in Civil War scholarship...</abstract>
