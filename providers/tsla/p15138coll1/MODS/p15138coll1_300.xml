  <abstract>Letter from Robert Rutledge to his father, G. R. Rutledge, explaining the strategic value of East Tennessee and the likelihood of a Union invasion. He implores his father to leave Cleveland, Tennessee, and flee south to Georgia before such a raid occurs and threatens the family and its finances. He explains his current encampment and the lack of rations, and he expresses his belief that the war is only beginning. He plans to re-enlist when his three-year service ends.</abstract>

  <abstract>[Page 1] “Cumberland Gap Apr 19th /63 Dear Father Considering the signs of the times I thought that I would drop you a few lines concrning the times as to the part East Tennessee is to play in this great struggle. I want you and the family to keep out of the reach of the Yankees if human power can do it. It would grieve me almost as bad to hear that you had off passed from the land of the living as to hear you were in the hands of the Yankees. They would most certainly imprison you and as to what might befall the female portion of the family and the little children I can hardly bear my mind to dwell upon it a minute. Dispatches to this point and these that are deemed reliable show that the enemy are going to make a seperate struggle to take and hold East Tennessee. Burnside is at Lexington with a heavy force. This will be his base of operations for a while. it is my belief that they intend to invest East Tennessee and if they try they can take it. Only a small force is required to come in the rear of C Gap to make us all skedaddle or surrender It is a fact to plainly to be seen by the enemy that East Tennessee is but poorly provided with troops They have a chance to be as well advised upon the number and desposition of our troops as we ourselves. Should Burnside really make a move upon us at this place he will take the Gap. not by whipping us but by coming in our rear and cutting off supplies. five or six days would do the work Cleveland is a place the enemy will make a strike for as soon as possible, so as to gain both” [Page 2] “R. R. I think your position is very safe at Cleveland and I want you to be prepared to leave for some point that is safer than Cleveland. Pa do not put off running untill it is too late I want you to run if you have to leave all our household goods. by going you can save all your money and every thing beside being insulted abused and starved to death. Keep posted and have every thing ready. If you cant get away any other way get a waggon or two and cut across into Georgia and get away from any R.R. I am not scared but the signs of the times all indicate that East Ten is to be made a battle ground if the enemy push on it is theirs for a time. We cannot help it. Troops are engaged at other points and I do not see where reinforcements are to come from. I am astonished that the Yanks have not made a raid into Cleveland before this it would be a very easy matter to accomplish it. There is new great probability of our being attacted here. It would not surprise me at any time to hear the enemys guns. We are now encamped on the North side of the Gap. Are in our camps, about 100 yards from the Breastworks and not far from the most important artilery, if the fight comes we will have the fun of supporting the batteries at the point where the enemy will try to take the Gap. Our Boys will fight well, and we will never surrender while human courage and endurance can stand it. Not many expect a fight here but I am” [Page 3] “see by the action of the officers in command that a fight is expected here soon. We were reinforced today by three Battallions of Infantry and one Company of Artilery and one of Cavalry Gen Gracy is here for a short time. I am well pleased with our Camping ground. The enemy cannot well surprise us where we are. We are very scarce of rations here at present. Hutch has just arrived and brought a letter from Nerva. Glad to hear you were all well. The enemy two Regts Strong are reported at Harlin Court House and fifteen hundred mounted men are reported as having passed through Morison Gap. Suppose they wish to get the Saltworks or Burn Bridges.” [Page 4] “Be careful where your money is so that you can always have a safe place to hide it Pa my honest convictions are that this war has just commenced. If I live I expect to serve out my full term of three years and have to enlist again. I see less prospect of the war ending now then ever. I think if you would try you might get a safer and cheaper place to live than Cleveland. I started my Grey Janes Pants and my two woolen shirts home today They will be either sent to you by express or be left at Coz Billy Ingles. I did not know when we might have to retreat and I cannot carry all my clothes so I thought best to pull off my Shirt and send home one is clean and the other dirty, if they are left at Coz Billy get the first one passing to express them Write soon I am well Your Son RARutledge.”</abstract>

    <abstract>The items in this collection offer new perspectives into the lives of numerous non-combatants during the Civil War in Tennessee and throughout the southeast.  The correspondence and primary writings touch on several themes relating to the home front, including the diverse roles of women, the relationship between occupying/invading forces and civilians, personal beliefs regarding secession and the war, and the effect of the war on African American Tennesseans.  These sources can offer the public a lens into the lives of many Civil War non-combatant men and women, a subject of increasing importance in Civil War scholarship...</abstract>
