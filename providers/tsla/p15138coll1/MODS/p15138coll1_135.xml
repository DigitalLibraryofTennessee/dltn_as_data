  <abstract>[Page 1] “Vicksburg Miss March 12th 1864 Hon. John S. Brien. Dear Sir, Though we have never met yet I think I know you. You have been represented to me by a gentleman of high legal and literary attainment, as one of the first legal minds in the United States. My purpose in writing to you at present is to lay before you the condition of my affairs and to ask you legal advice. When the United States forces came into and occupied this state my estate was worth over two hundred thousand dollars unimcumbered not owing a dollar to any one. While Genl Grant’s army was besieging the City of Vicksburg during the months of June and July last they took every thing I possessed on earth that they could get in their possession – provisions, horses, mules, stock of every kind, forage, grain, nearly one hundred negroes, burned my residence, Gin, mill, stables, all my out buildings except a few negro houses, left the plantation in such a perfect wreck that it is impossible to occupy it. My cash ballance is something over twenty five thousand dollars in what I conceive to be good hands but not available at present, and may not be until the end of the war. So far as my claims on the government of the United States are concerned, nothing can” [Page 2] “be done here There is no Court of Claims established in this state nor do I see any prospect of such a Court being organized here or any future time. Can my claim be laid before the Court at Nashville to a successful termination, think you. Or can you do anything in a legal power of view to assist us to gather something out of the wreck of our fortune? I have taken no part in the rebellion, but have remained a non Combattant tacitly at home as long as I have one. I have been a successful Physician, can make a living any where, if there is anything to do in that way, but here all is gone that makes life bearable – turn the eye in whatever direction you may, desolation marks every spot. Meet whom you may, distress marks every feature the fiery element has left but few homes untouched but few spots unblackened, robery, outrage and murder are of daily occurance. I drop[?] the scene on this dark dream of life. Mr. &amp; Mrs A. W. Brien are well. Wille [?] Lin I only see occasionally, though we hear from him every few days. His wife and children are well. Mary sends many kind regards to all and to yourself her fond affections I am very truly &amp; c J. W. Maybin”</abstract>

    <abstract>The items in this collection offer new perspectives into the lives of numerous non-combatants during the Civil War in Tennessee and throughout the southeast.  The correspondence and primary writings touch on several themes relating to the home front, including the diverse roles of women, the relationship between occupying/invading forces and civilians, personal beliefs regarding secession and the war, and the effect of the war on African American Tennesseans.  These sources can offer the public a lens into the lives of many Civil War non-combatant men and women, a subject of increasing importance in Civil War scholarship...</abstract>
