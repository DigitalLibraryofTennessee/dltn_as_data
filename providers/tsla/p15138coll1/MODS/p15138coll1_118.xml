  <abstract>Two-page letter from Elisha W. Harris to his son George Carroll Harris of Nashville. He writes from his plantation Waco Place in Louisiana of the war being upon them with bloody consequence. He has abandoned his efforts to cling to the union and now seeks to punish enemies. He mentions the firing on Fort Sumter spurring on family to enlist, the scarcity of currency, the suspension of business, money problems with his plantation overseer, absentee planters, and the running away of a slave.</abstract>

  <abstract>[Page 1] “Waco Place Saty 4th. May 61 My Dear George, The dire pestilence war is upon us with all its terrible prospects of abundant blood. I, like old Va, held on the old ship, but not so long, until it became evident the Nt. had determined to do nothing but tantelize &amp; defy us. Thus, giving up all hope of a satisfactory adjustment. I some time ago, not only felt willing to give up the union as it was , but really ambitionus to punish our enemies. When the Sumpter affair broke out, I dashed up to Monroe for the express purpose of endeavoring to disuade Arthur from going now. It was three days before he yielded, &amp; then reluctantly told him, for the present, it was not certain he would be needed. When ever it was evident his services were actually needed, as a father I would say, go my son. Mikey having no family, I would have been mortified not to have seen him keen to go. Last night Arthur’s Geo came down bringing letters &amp; papers, among them a pencil note from Mike to A. saying they were at the barracks 3 ½ mls below the city, &amp; expected to be ordered either to Cairo, Corinth, or Richmond in a day or so. A H Martin Capt. of the Pellican Guards. The Pargoud (Cap Tobin) took them down last Tuesday week gratis. The whole country in a furor of excitement here. Nearly all business (plantations excepted) suspended. Money matters at a dead standstill. I, with many other planters, have been caught without a dollar” [Page 2] “to defray last year’s expenses. I had got all my supplies except the deficit of corn, which I have just written for, &amp; very much fear they will not send. Recently, I was urged to give a draft of $50 in hard &amp; pressing case. &amp; so wrote them. They declined honoring it saying they “didn’t have it &amp; could’nt get get it” It comes back &amp; I am to be sued on it. All my accts up here are harrassing me distressingly while I am utterly powerless. Myelle annoying me more than any. I owe him some $5,500. Heretofore, I have always handed him what ever monies he asked. Now he knows it can’t be had. He is down upon me without mercy. It is getting up a bad feeling between us. &amp; if he persists, would not be surprised if we part soon. Those of his acts, which I’ve not paid, I have assumed. Now requires me to secure the safety of his debt to him. It looks a little strange that $100,000 worth of property is’nt good against his &amp; other debts we owe. But he is ignorant, timid &amp; suspicious. Our crop is all planted, good stand cotton, corn not all up. 340 in cotton &amp; 150 in corn, making 17 acres to the hand. Large crop, abundance of heavy rains. Raining terribly now. Lost two mules lately, &amp; a third stolen. Bill ran away three weeks ago because Megelle gave him a dozen strapes for omission of a protective injunction, &amp; has not been heard of. Have my hands full of business. My own, Layton’s, Lacy’s and Bryan’s plantations to attend to. &amp; I understand my frd [friend?] Carrington wishes me to attend to his. Can you come to see us soon? How is your gal matter progressing? Your M a unites in love &amp;c. Affy E w Harris Latter part March or first Apl I enclosed you $10 &amp; a $5. in bills. All I had, &amp; asked you to acknowlege the letter only.”</abstract>

    <abstract>The items in this collection offer new perspectives into the lives of numerous non-combatants during the Civil War in Tennessee and throughout the southeast.  The correspondence and primary writings touch on several themes relating to the home front, including the diverse roles of women, the relationship between occupying/invading forces and civilians, personal beliefs regarding secession and the war, and the effect of the war on African American Tennesseans.  These sources can offer the public a lens into the lives of many Civil War non-combatant men and women, a subject of increasing importance in Civil War scholarship...</abstract>
