  <abstract>[Page 1] “Monday morning 19th, All well Mary improving &amp; baby growing like a young gosling. Just 3 weeks old &amp; weighs 9 lbs 10 oz. The nurse is gone &amp; I have taken her place at night and let Mary sleep. I get sleeping about half the night. Will leave providence permitting two weeks from tomorrow. Custom House Boston Aug 17th /61 My Dear Mother As channels of communication have been opened I send by two, in order if possible to let you know how we are &amp; that we will start for home as soon as the 3rd of Sept. Mary cannot travel before that time. On the 15th (last Thursday) I received a letter from Samuel dated July 17th and containing the sad intelligence of Fathers sever illness; although I have been anxious to get home, and wait with a good deal of impatience, his letter has increased my anxiety: But the time will soon roll around. As soon as the child was born, I wrote by Adanis” [Page 2] “and hope you have received it. I would have written oftener and sooner had I known that letters were carried through. I hope to hear from you again before I leave. Mary has got along as well as we could possibly expect. She has been up nearly a week. Her health improved up to the day she was taken sick, and she was stronger and better than she had been any time after the attack of Asthma last fall. She has a good constitution, and if I can only get her to Tenn. I have no fears for her health. The babe, Eleanor Gregg, grows finely and is getting fat, it was poor when born. Mary’s desires in regard to it have all ben realized but one. She wanted it should have black hair &amp; eyes &amp; look just like me in this she has been gratified. But in its” [Page 3] “sex she has been disappointed as she desired a son. I am now making boxes for packing our goods &amp; chattles. We cannot take them along, but I want to pack them myself, So that I may know that it is well done. We will have two very large trunks and will take all we can in them. I will resign my place the last of this month. We are supplying ourselves with clothing, and by the time we get home we will not have very much money left; but will be out of debt almost, and can have an even start. If my dear Father still lives; tell him that, if God in His providence permits &amp; our lives are spared in a month or 6 weeks he shall see me; for if anything should happen to prevent Mary from going, I will go alone: My health is good and has” [Page 4] “been nearly all the time since I have been here. Mother Silsby sends her love to you. She is grieving at the prospect of parting with her children. From anxiety she manifests about me she evidently looks upon me as one of her own and she is in ecstacies over her little grand-daughter. The battle at Bull Run has cast a gloom over the north and had an effect upon the people similar to that of thrusting a stick into a beehive upon its inmates. They are claiming a victory at Springfield Mo. But there is very little said about it, and the particulars are kept back so much, that a great many are convinced that it was anything but a victory. They represent the forces of the Confederacy as numbering 23,000 &amp; the federals at 5,500. Quite a difference. Mary &amp; the baby join me in love to you all Tell Johny, Samy, Lucy, &amp; Kate, Cousin Eleanore sends love to them and is coming to see them. Farwell for the present mother. We hope to see you soon. Your Affectionate Son J G Latta”</abstract>

    <abstract>The items in this collection offer new perspectives into the lives of numerous non-combatants during the Civil War in Tennessee and throughout the southeast.  The correspondence and primary writings touch on several themes relating to the home front, including the diverse roles of women, the relationship between occupying/invading forces and civilians, personal beliefs regarding secession and the war, and the effect of the war on African American Tennesseans.  These sources can offer the public a lens into the lives of many Civil War non-combatant men and women, a subject of increasing importance in Civil War scholarship...</abstract>
