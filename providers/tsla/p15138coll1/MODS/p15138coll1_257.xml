  <abstract>[Page 1] “Greenvil Sept 18th 1862 Dear Pa As this has been a day of rest I thought I would write you a letter. We had two verry good sermons from Dr. Pitts to day and I think he is a doing a great deal of good in this County among he class of men we call Tories. And I think there will several Companies be made up in this County in the next two weeks and what say you to me take the place of first Lieutennant in one of them for I have had a proposition made me and I have a notion of taken it if you are willing and Ma says yes. If I go at all it will be with a verry clever man by the name of Eason but I am a little affraid of the men that will volentier at this late date But there is some good Sothren men left yet and Eason knows all the men in this County as he has been a Merchant for several years in Greenvill Well I received your letter last night and found enclosed in it two ten dollar bills that I may kneed before long as I may have to go to Knoxvill about Monday and if so I will have to buy me a coat to wear and if I go to Knoxvill I intend coming home to stay a day or two if I can spare the time. But if I do not go to Knoxvill I can wate until next week for my coat. If want you to have it made in uniform stile with brass buttons strait Cotton &amp;c I can get me a coat made out of grey Janes here that will cost me about twenty five dollars and the Janes is fine and thick. And I was thinking of buying the cloth and sending it home but it will cost about three dollars a yard” [Page 2] “and another thing that I was wanting a coat fir is, I have been invited to a weding, by a young man who is aging to marry one of the Miss Netherlands in Sulavan County and I would like to go and see some of my Couisns That I have never seen it comes of next Thursday and I may get my coat in that time. A coat here will cost twenty five dollars ready made at this place but I will have to buy it from the Jew as there is nobody has them here except Jews I will buy me a pair of boots as the price is getting higher every week and I can get me a good pair for thirteen dollars There is an Irish Bootmaker here that has taken a great fancy to me and he wants to make me a pair of boots He went to Knoxville last week to get me some leather and he will not charge me any thing for making them except the price of the leather and he makes a very good boot. Cousin Robert Willson spent one night this week with me he is on his way to Sulavan to buy some flour and he thinks he can get it for ten dollars a barrel and I told him to buy me five at that price he said he would. I am nearly well again and havent any idea how long I will stay here if Martial Law is extended in Tennessee I will stay a good while. But if Rob resigns his place we will join Morgan as Capt Brittain has promised him he will give me a transfer to some other Company Tell Willie &amp; Laura that I read their letters and I was glad to see that they were learning to write Tell Laura to learn fast and for her and Willie to write to me again I will not kneed any money unless I have to buy a coat Your affectionate Son Write soon G. G. Rutledge”</abstract>

    <abstract>The items in this collection offer new perspectives into the lives of numerous non-combatants during the Civil War in Tennessee and throughout the southeast.  The correspondence and primary writings touch on several themes relating to the home front, including the diverse roles of women, the relationship between occupying/invading forces and civilians, personal beliefs regarding secession and the war, and the effect of the war on African American Tennesseans.  These sources can offer the public a lens into the lives of many Civil War non-combatant men and women, a subject of increasing importance in Civil War scholarship...</abstract>
