  <abstract>[Page 1] “Monroe La. June 21st 61 Dear George Your telegraphic dispatch of the 15th was not received until a moment ago. Owing to my absence from home for the past week. I have been off on another recruiting expedition &amp; have just returned to Town, dirty, dusty, &amp; tired. I will therefore reply briefly to your enquiries &amp; go home for a bath &amp; a light colored linen. However I rather think that the information you seek was given in a letter I mailed to you about 10 days since. &amp; it ought to have reached you by this time. If not within a day or two after your dispatch was sent off. Mike is in the 2nd Louisiana Regt. under the Command of Col De.Russy of Red River. They were stationed at Yorktown Va at last account &amp; eager for a fuss of some kind or other. The cannons firing at Great Bethel were heard by the boys at Yorktown (10 miles distant) &amp; they immediately hurried on there in double quick time but did not arrive at the battle ground until about an hour after the fun was all over. They hate it very much” [Page 2] “As to the Chaplaincey. There is no prospect of forming the Regt here to which I alluded in a former letter. At the time I wrote I was confident the project would go through like a flash &amp; I was anxious to get you in the same Regt with me. But as you cannot be with me I would like for you to be with Mike &amp; my impression is that that Regt has no Chaplain. However if that place is filled dont be in a hurry. We are going to have a long war! Many new Regts will yet have to be formed. I shall be in some one of them &amp; will put your name forward then if you are not engaged. Dont be in too much haste to accept the position among entire strangers. I am getting along slowly but surely with my Rifle Company. Am not in too much hurry. Because I am satisfied those fanatics of the North will be fools enough to give us all a chance. They intend to annoy &amp; harass us for years. I wont say fight us, because I believe that the cowardly set will run every time after they have had 2 or 3 good dressings down. I know we can whip the infernal rascals &amp; drive them back to the mysterious caverns of Yankeedom &amp; we must do it at the risk of all that is dear to us. Adieu Your Aff Bro A.H. Harris”</abstract>

    <abstract>The items in this collection offer new perspectives into the lives of numerous non-combatants during the Civil War in Tennessee and throughout the southeast.  The correspondence and primary writings touch on several themes relating to the home front, including the diverse roles of women, the relationship between occupying/invading forces and civilians, personal beliefs regarding secession and the war, and the effect of the war on African American Tennesseans.  These sources can offer the public a lens into the lives of many Civil War non-combatant men and women, a subject of increasing importance in Civil War scholarship...</abstract>
