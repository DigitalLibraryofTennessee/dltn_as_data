&#8220;Maryville March 12th 1862
	Mr. Rutledge Dear Sir
I have concluded to rite you a few lines again as I expect you are anxious to know something about your business here. The prospect for collecting is very bad There is an entire change of officers here Hutton our Sheriff was beat by William Findlay, Clark will be out office Bowerman beat by Preston Rowan, Broils beat by Hood McCoy beat by 		of Louisville, for Clerk &#8211; James Carnes, and William Kidd elected, Constables in Maryville District all except Carnes and Kidd are Union men, Clark would not undertake to collect any of there notes but old James Walker and Sam Leas, Charles Stone has not returned yet they say they are looking for him every day Tories are distressing here many people are doing little or no business our preperation for crops is very backward Our new officers are not sworn in yet, business is at a stand still the prospect for collecting Gold is extremely bad I think all most impossible I would like to hear from you soon. I would have rote you sooner but wated to see if Charly would come&#8221;
