<dc:title>Correspondence from Mary Guthrie Latta to Samuel R. Latta, April 6, 1862</dc:title>

&#8220;Dyersburg Tenn April 6th &#8216;62
My dear husband.
	I received your last letter yesterday - &amp; having dressed Johnnie for church, nursed the baby to sleep sent Kate to the kitchen to keep her from crying to be dressed to go to preaching &amp; now while I have a few moments of silence I will sit down to write you, that all&#8217;s well. Two little words, but containing a world of welcome news to an absent parent. I wish you could see Johnnie this morning &#8211; he is looking so very nice. I made him a pair of new pants - &amp; with his hands stuck in his pockets, he struts about as if he were lord of all he surveys. Kate wanted to go to preaching. I told her when she got as large as Johnny she might go. She told him to turn around &amp; let her measure to see if she wasn&#8217;t already as big - of course Johnny&#8217;s dignity was very much insulted at the idea&#8221;

&#8220;You see I have to write you of the doings &amp; sayings of the children to make out a letter, for I haven&#8217;t one bit of news &#8211; but let me not forget the baby. My child &#8211; the dearest, sweetest &amp; best of all &#8211; your children aint nowhere. She has grown very fast, &amp; is as fat as a little dumpling &#8211; laughing &amp; crowing as merry as a bird (if birds laugh) &amp; already knows its mammy. Don&#8217;t you wish you could see it?
	We went last Wednesday &amp; spent the day with John. He is busy as can be on his farm. He begins to look a good deal like a farmer, but I fear it will prove too laborious a business for him. When he comes in from work he looks completely exhausted. &amp; I don&#8217;t think he will be able to stand the warm weather at all. Mother has been out there several days making soap. She may be glad she has no more sons to marry &#8211; for she has had her own troubles with her daughters, &amp; has been indeed a true mother to us. She passed her sixty ninth birth day a few days ago, &amp; is now in her seventyth year. &amp; yet as stirring &amp; energetic as any of her daughters. May her&#8221;

[Page 3]

&#8220;remaining days be passed peacefully &amp; happily in our home. I received a letter from Cousin Beck the day before I got yours telling me she could not come at present. I wrote to her that she might probably get here on the Ben McCullough, but since then, I hear it has been pressed into the service. &amp; I believe is not to go farther than the Point. I would like very much to see her, still am not very sorry that her visit is to be postponed for awhile until we get something to eat. As I see my vegetables peeping out of the ground I think it will not be a great while before I have something nice. We had news that you were expecting a battle there on yesterday &#8211; Saturday &#8211; I have been very uneasy, for fear it might be so &#8211; but have tried to comfort myself by thinking all is not truth that we hear. But whenever the hour does come, all I can do is to trust in Him who alone is able to save, &amp; my hope is, that He may be your shield on the day of battle. You think you will not get home any more until your time is out &#8211; it is a good while to do without seeing you. But if you only&#8221;

[Page 4]

&#8220;get home safely then I will try &amp; be satisfied. I was in hopes there would be no necessity for your returning, &amp; I cannot say a word either for or against it &#8211; my own selfishness would urge you to stay &amp; home. The country needs every man. &amp; I fear every woman too to help it out of the struggle in which it is engaged. But if you have to reenlist can&#8217;t you avoid doing so until your time is out. Then you can stay at home as long as you please.
	The weather is getting so warm I expect you will be needing some lighter underclothes. If Capt. Fowlkes can take them, I will send them to you. If not by the first opportunity.
	Make a general proclamation to the soldiers, that if they value their lives they had better let you come home. For if they don&#8217;t Johnny says he is coming down there &amp; kill them every one. Father desires me to give you his love &amp; say he is living in hopes of seeing you again soon. The children all send a kiss. As I can&#8217;t have you I kiss your likeness instead, which I have had before me since I have been writing. Thinking when I see it what a precious man you are for them old Yankees to shoot at. Goodbye.
					Ever yours,
