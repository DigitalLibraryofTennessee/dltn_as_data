&#8220;Kiss my Babys for me, and tell little George that his Pappy is still alive and thinks of him, and would love Oh so dearly to take him up and nurse him. May He who rules above grant me that pleasure one more 
	Yours RAR
Camp near Cumberland Gap April 1st 
Dear Wife
	I wrote Pa yesterday by Sagt John England asking my valicece sent me. I now write asking it not sent as yesterday evening I bought a trunk . One made exactly like the one Ophilia is using in your room I gave four dollars for it, it is somewhat worn but has a good lock and hinges and will answer me better than my valiece. We have moved from our old camps about one and 3/4ths miles Are in quarters lately ocupied by Hilliards Legien have a tolerably comfortable cabin, has a floor but is quite airy. Brit is sweeping it up and I can hardly write but hope you can read it We moved yesterday, was snowing occasienally all day. A small skift of snow on the ground now. Our situation I do not like because we are in a splendid place to be surprised A high hill on each side of us, I bought a trunk at four dollars a cot, a very nice one at two dollars and a quilt at two dollars. We will stay here all summer and I am going to try to live comfortable. last night was a swinger and I like to froze out , will buy another quilt and then I can have a good warm comfortable bed. Dr Atchly has resigned his place as asst Surgeon and starts home tomorrow. Sorry he has gone. He was a special friend of mine. The Tories have stoled all his corn since he left home. Some four or five hundred bushils, enough to make any man&#8221;

&#8220;want to get home ant it? Do not know who will fill his place, have found out that Col Fulkerson did not oppose my being Asst Surgeon but I never knew that it was just one or two Lieuts. in the Regt that opposed it because I had knocked some of their friends out of that situation; They unknowingly unintentionally done me a great favor. The Lincolnites, Bushwackers of Harlan County have sent in a petition to Col Fain asking for a cessasion of hostilities it is signed by the Capt of the Bushwackers, and in their petition they invite all the Southern men that they have run away from Harlin to return to their homes, guarentieing them protection of lives and property. Col F. done thus much in subduing the enemy in his last trip to Harlin. Should this letter reach you before Sarg England sees you my other letter will tell you what we done on that trip (or at least they,) I am about sound again and hope I may stay well during my stay at this old Gap. We will move up into the Gap in a few days in our tents. And I think will stay there untill peace is made, if it ever is. A great many parolid North Western Deserters have passed through this Gap on their way to their homes. Say they will fight us no more. This is the 1st of Apr Tom Hoyl came down to our cabin and call me in a great hurry to see a sick man as both our Surgeons are on the other side of the Gap I went and found him sleeping soundly and sweetly, fooled warnt I? I paid Tom back with interest in about half an hour. About a dozen have come in today to see Capt Brittain dying with the cholic and found him up and well, and were told that their trouble was all for the 1st of Apr. such is our life and our fun, but our hardships ______
