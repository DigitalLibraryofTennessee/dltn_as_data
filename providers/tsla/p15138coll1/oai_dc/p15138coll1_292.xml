&#8220;Cumberland Gap Apr 30th 1863
Dear Wife
	I recd a letter from Pa a few days ago and answered it I was happy indeed last night to receive a good long letter from you, but indeed sorry to hear my little Boy was still sick. I would love to be where I could attend to him and nurse him. And so for little Eva I can hardly think of her than just a little babe, not able to do any thing. You say she was trying to catch your paper and laughing while you were writing. Would love to nurse her and see her laugh. I would have been happy to have seen Green and your Father. I know it was a great gratification to you to be with them once more for a while. &#8211; Glad the Clarks and Jim Porter and Jess Kidd are into it. Suppose we will have more help. &#8211; Not much did you say? &#8211; You are mistaken about one of our Company dying in Cleveland. That Johnson was a R.R. hand and a Brother to Jim Johnson of our Company &#8211; I am highly pleased with the description of the farm that Gellespie has purchased for Pa. Think Pa ought to write Gillispe word to purchase the adjoining tract that he spoke of. I wish I were ready to get to Texas now. I will before long have a thousand dollars &#8211; if I should live to do so I expect to buy land in Texas with it. I now have just five dollars left, Lt Lane had a chance to send the $30.00 to me that I sent by him to buy me that cloth but did not do it. I can borrow some money to do me untill I draw. The Government is due me today $1.80 You seem to regret that you had to buy a calico dress for you and George on account of prices. Whenever you need any &#8220;

&#8220;thing just buy it. Do not render yourself or the children uncomfortable on account of high prices. You and Pa seem to think there is not much danger of an invasion of East Ten. There is not much probability of an attact here until after the Tullahoma fight. Our Cavalry brought five prisoners in that were captured at Barbourville. Three were from Ohio and two East Tennesseans, one from Ohio was a Lieut. They say we will have work to do here shortly. They were very talkative and were wedded to their cause I asked the Yank Lieut if he saw any indication of peace he said that there was less prospect of peace now than ever before, he said he wished for peace and the whole Northern army were the same way. I believe from all the signs of the times that this war has just commenced I believe that more blood will be spilled, yet than has been spilled during this war. I write Pa about the probability of my being arrested for trying to get out of Grays Brigade. I am still at large but am at their service. McBrittain says for Pa to tell Lush Osmant to send him about $100 in his shinplasters and he will pass them off for him. We hear that the Linclonites are cutting up in Bradley. Stealing and pressing guns. The boys are writing to different portions of the county to get them to petition the authorities to let our Company come to Cleveland and rid the county of all such Tories. I want Pa to see if he can do any thing to get us there. Write soon with love to all. I am as ever yours &amp;c

<dc:description>Letter from Robert Rutledge expressing concern for his sick son, correcting an earlier assertion that a member of his company was killed, and describing plans to buy land in Texas.  He asks his wife to buy needed provisions without concern for price. He doubts testimony from captured Union troops about a Union invasion of East Tennessee and could still face arrest for trying to get out of Gracy's Brigade and being "at large."  He would like his company to be sent to fight the Lincolnites in Cleveland.</dc:description>
