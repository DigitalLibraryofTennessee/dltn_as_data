<dc:relation>[Page 1]

&#8220;Davis Lake. Jany 28th 1864
My own darling wife: -- 
	I have just heard that a neighbor will start to Memphis in the morning and with a few lines hastly, not knowing whether they will ever reach you.
	In December I wrote two letters to you and one to Mr. Martin &amp; sent them to Memphis to be forwarded. I have been informed they were sent to Nashville to Mr. Houston, as they were letters of importance I am anxious to know whether you or Mr. Martin ever received them. Has the money ever been sent to you or Mr. Martin. My instructions were that the amount be equally divided between you. I have some fears that the amt has not been sent from Memphis as directed. If it has not, have Mr. Claiborne Deloach (of the House of Apperson &amp; Deloach) &amp; Mr. Pickett written to on the subject. Mr. Deloach can fully inform you. There is still on hand a large quantity of and I hope to be able to make you another remittance.&#8221;

[Page 2]

&#8220;I am still without an overseer on either place and of course much harrassed &amp; troubled. Mr. Morrow I hope will return before long from Texas whither I sent him in December with about 30 negroes &amp; clothing &amp;c&amp;c. The negroes here are doing very well. None of them have left as yet. I am making my arrangements to make a crop hoping they will remain with me.
	I have no news to write as I never see a newspaper or see any one who knows more that myself. I endeavor to hear with fortitude the desolation which is sweeping over our poor country. Is there no statesman, North or South, who rising above the angry waves of party prejudice &amp; national animositis, can calm the raging storm?
	I have not heard a word from you or my children either directly or indirectly since I left you in August!!!. I have not language to express my feelings of anxiety and anguish. What can I do? What shall I do? Is there no way of hearing from you? Can you not get a letter to Memphis for me directed&#8221;

&#8220;to care of Mr. C. DeLoach or Pickett. You perhaps had better send it to care of Mr. Claiborne DeLoach. He has frequent opportunities of sending it to me.
	The money which I remit to you I want you to use as I requested in my letters in Dec. I am trying very hard to sell something and I trust you will act with judgment. Do not hesitate or delay to do as I requested you. I am anxious for you to secure your Mother&#8217;s place. Tell Mr. Martin to write me fully about those papers, if she could do anything. Have they ever been sent to Little Rock or has she been able to do anything?
	I expect to remain here as long as I can do any good and until I hear from you. My own dear sweet wife! My heart is always with you. Not an hour passes but your trials are the subject of my thoughts. How I long to be with you as your time approaches. Do not give away to feelings of despondency, but be cheerful &amp; happy. Firmness &amp; nerve in the hour of trial will take away or alleviate many a rain.
	The uncertainty of how long our seperation will&#8221;

[Page 4]

&#8220;will continue overpowers me and my life seems to be a blank. Do write me your news how we are to manage to be restored to each other ever more. Can you come to me? Or can I, or must I, come to you? Write fully. Kiss my dear children for me &amp; do not let them forget they have a father who loves them as few parents love. I hope George &amp; Henry are studying &amp; improving themselves. Above all things, except being christians, I desire them to be educated gentlemen. Give my love to your our Mother, Pah &amp; also Mr. Martin &amp; family.
S	When you write direct your letter to care of Claiborne DeLoach at Memphis &amp; to care of Mr. Hudson, or D. Shepherd, on Arkansas River. Mr. Hudson lives on Col Barber&#8217;s place &amp; will take the trouble to send me the letter.
	I am exceedingly anxious to open a way of communication between us &amp; will wait with impatience to hear. When then this reaches you. I have heard nothing from Cad Catheby. Tell Irome Pillow to come to see me when he comes to Helena.
	I suppose Mr. Martin will be unable to visit the plantation. I wrote her fully about Mother here in Dec.
Good night.
