<dc:description>Corporal J. M. Morey was captured by General Sherman's men in February 1865. By April he had been placed in a Federal prison at Hart's Island, New York. This oath of allegiance was probably a condition of his release from the military prison in June 1865.  L.H.B. are the initials of Louisa H. Broughton, the woman he would wed in August 1865.</dc:description>
