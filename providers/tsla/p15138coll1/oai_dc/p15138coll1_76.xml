<dc:title>Correspondence from Sarah Hamilton to John B. Hamilton, February 1, 1863</dc:title>
<dc:relation>&#8220;February 1st, 1863

Dear Husband

	I write you a few lines this evening as I have a good opportunity of sending it. I have not received a letter from you since you left home. I am fearful that you are sick or something has happened or you would have written before this.
	I received a letter from Tommie yesterday. It was written to you. He was not very well. He had diarhaea [sic]. He wanted a boy to wait on him. I wish you would go and see him and bring him home until he can get well.
	The conscript is taking every one now from 18 to 45. The law which exempted a man because he had 20negroes has been repealed. They all have to go now. There was two men here today on hunt for conscripts.
	It is rumored that Rosecrans has fallen back to Nashville. I suppose it is because Morgan and Wheeler have taken so many transports on the Cumberland. It was false report about the Yankees coming out to Columbia. It is filled with southern soldiers now. There is a great many sick at the hospital now.
	It is reported that Longstreet is at Shellbyville but it is not generaly [sic] believed.
	I am trying to do the best I can. I have not got any man or boy to stay with me yet nor do I think I can get one. It seems impossible for I have been trying my best and have failed.
	Tell Harriet Mariah is doing very well. Her baby is growing up fast.
	I enclose the letter Tommie wrote you. In this you can read them for yourself. Mr. Crosby sold out all of his sugar and did not let me know any thing about it so I did not get any sugar. Write as soon as you receive this for I am anxious to hear from you .
	Yours with respect
