Dear husband

	Another opportunity having presented itself, I will write you a few lines. Although I have no news; I can write. We are all tolerable well at present; &amp; doing as well as can be expected under the existing circumstances. I was glad to hear from you; Bro Milrner [sic] said he heard from you a few days before he came up; he came up Saturday &amp; is with us tonight but will start early in the morning. I received a letter from Tommie today by flag of truce dated Feb.1st you will please forward the enclosed to him. I suppose you have heard that Cary &amp; Lou are living within the lines. Do not grieve at the loss of property &amp; negroes; I have learned to bear it all paciently [sic] &amp; put my trust in God &amp; look forward to a brighter future. I wish you could be at home in peace; How long! Oh! How long will this unholy war continue? Oh that it would cease so that every weary homesick wanderer could return home again.
	As I&#8217;ve no news to write; I will close. May good angels guard your sleeping &amp; waking hours; &amp; may God&#8217;s strong arm be ever around you is the heart felt prayer of your.
			Devoted Wife
