<dc:title>Correspondence from Mary Guthrie Latta to Samuel R. Latta II, August 19, 1861</dc:title>
<dc:relation>[Page 1]

&#8220;Dyersburg Tenn Aug 19th 1861
My own dear husband - ,
	We returned home with lightened hearts. Thinking that our noble Tennessee troops had been ordered to a safe retreat. Where we earnestly hoped they would have to remain. But our joy was suddenly turned into disappointment when the unwelcome tidings reached us the next day that you had been ordered back to New Madrid. I was flattering myself that if you remained at Randolph, you would be at home often &#8211; Now I have no hope of seeing you until the campaign closes. Which God grant may be soon, for this state of uncertainty and suspense is enough to wear away the stoutest hearts. &amp; though I try to meet it as bravely as possible, &amp; hope that all may yet be well. There are times when I feel as if I cannot endure it to the&#8221;

&#8220;end. It is some comfort to know you are meeting your troubles with so much spirit &amp; bravery. &amp; I can only trust to the God of battles to be with you in your trials.
	Mrs. Prince arrived yesterday. With your precious letter. I was at church. (Mr. Hall&#8217;s) when I saw her drive through town. I could scarcely curb my impatience, to remain in the church &amp; the sermon fell on a heedless ear. I thought I never heard such a long tiresome sermon. When I got home your letter was waiting me. &amp; never was so anxious to know whether you had got well or not. You would consider yourself of considerable importance if you knew how many wretched moments you cause me. Our trip home from Booth&#8217;s Point was as you anticipated a very unpleasant one. The morning broke upon us cloudy &amp; dull. &amp; after waiting two or three hours for Dr. McGaughey to visit a sick man&#8221;

[Page 3]

&#8220;we turned our faces homeward with the pleasant expectation of travelling home through a heavy rain. This however was escaped with only a slight shower, when a worse trouble arose. Dr. Mc. mule refused to go. After waiting about an hour &amp; half on him to get his mule exchanged, we started again. Got a mile or two from the river, when the Dr. got frightened again with his horse. After making  another exchange, which detained us an hour longer, we again started, arrived at home about three o&#8217;clock. Found all as well as usual, except Vickie. She was much worse while we were away. &amp; was still very bad when we got home. She has been improving for the last week though her mind is still as weak as a childs. I have but small hopes that she will entirely recover. You cannot realize what a sad thing it is to look upon such a wreck. She hangs upon me as Johnnie or Kate would do.&#8221;

&#8220;expecting the same caresses, &amp; the same treatment as I give them. &#8220;Sister Mary&#8221; is constantly on her tongue. &amp; must be all that is on her mind. Poor little Johnnie has paid dearly for his trip to see Pa. He has been very sick since he came home. He had high fever when we got home. &amp; it never abated for three or four days. Today is the first day he has been without fever. It is well you cannot see his dear little pale face, for it would haunt you all through the wars. He was not satisfied with his visit. He said he did not see his Pa enough, &amp; he wants you to come home. We have some fears tonight that Kate will be sick, as she is now asleep, &amp; with high fever on her. I have been trying to nurse them all well again, so that if there was the least possible chance of getting to see you again, I would make the attempt for like Johnnie I did not get to see you half enough. If you remain in New Madrid any time.&#8221;</dc:relation>
