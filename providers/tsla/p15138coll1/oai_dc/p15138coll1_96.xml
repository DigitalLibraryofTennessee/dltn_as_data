<dc:title>Correspondence from Elisha W. Harris to George Carroll Harris, September 20, 1860</dc:title>
<dc:description>Six-page letter to his son George Carroll Harris of Nashville, Elisha W. Harris writes from his plantation Waco Place in Louisiana of attending a local political meeting. He details the zest the crowd displays for politics and the presidential election of 1860, but he declines to get caught up in the excitement, despite his support of the Breckinridge ("B") and Lane ("L") ticket. He supports the South ending party strife and uniting against the common foe.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Deep South Democrats abandoned the Democratic National Convention proceedings in June of 1860 with the nomination of Stephen A. Douglas for president and the party's refusal to protect the South's institution of slavery. Instead , they reconvened  and proposed their own candidates in the form of strong pro-slavery Democrat John C. Breckinridge from Kentucky for president and Joseph Lane from Oregon as the vice-presidential candidate.</dc:description>
