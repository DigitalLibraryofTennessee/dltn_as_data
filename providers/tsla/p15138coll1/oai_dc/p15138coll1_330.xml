<dc:description>The Tennessee General Assembly formed the General Claims Commission February 19, 1868, to compensate loyal citizens who suffered property losses at the hands of Union or Confederate forces and to pay unpaid wages.  The Commission operated through county claims commissioners and were to present the claims to the U.S. Government; however, the claims were recorded but not paid.  Wartime claims would be both recorded and paid through the Southern Claims Commission, formed in 1871.</dc:description>
