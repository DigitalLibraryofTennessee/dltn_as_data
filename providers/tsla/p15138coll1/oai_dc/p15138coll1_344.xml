<dc:description>The Oath of Allegiance, also called the Loyalty Oath, was a document signed by persons during and after the Civil War to pledge loyalty and allegiance to the Union. Initially intended for employees of the Federal government and military personnel,  the oath soon took several different forms and eventually extended to the state level. Employment and business ownership were then dependent on signed oaths.</dc:description>
