&#8220;Macon Dec. 29th 1861
Dear Cousin Sam,
	Your kind letter was received some days since, but I have been so busy preparing for our grand entertainment that I have not had time to write. It is over now, &amp; I am truly thankful. Our net proceeds were seventy dollars. Which I have paid to the agent of the Southern Mothers in Memphis. Every one seemed highly pleased with the performances, which consisted of music, tableaux, dialogues, &amp;c. Well, I cannot say that I have &#8220;fought, bled and died for my country.&#8221; Still I think have endured nearly as much in assisting get up the affair. Live and learn is a wise maxim, but I never so fully realized its truth&#8221;

&#8220;as since we commenced preparing for the concert. Christmas thus far has been very dull here. I suppose it is the same every place. The old year is almost gone and what a year of suffering it has been. How many tears of sorrow and anguish and prayers of agony it has witnessed. We can only hope and pray that the coming one may have better times in store for us. True everything looks dosy and gloomy in the future. While there is so much macowber in my composition that I cannot but think &#8220;Something will turn up.&#8221; Though for some days past, I have felt, that I was almost &#8220;floored&#8221; Our school is small. Mr. Jones has not been able to make any collections, consequently cannot pay his teachers. I have almost determined to resign at the close&#8221;

&#8220;of the present session. If I do, I will go to Dyersburg. I have not heard from Cousin Mary in some time. I do trust you went home Christmas. I received the paper containing your letter. What a brave, suble fellow Mr. Sampson must be. I think he took more prisoners than any one I have heard of. Give him my best respects and congratulations on his success. I am sure my most earnest desire, is that you may never have another battle. It made me heart sick to read the accounts of &#8220;The Belmont Skirmish,&#8221; (as the Federals term it.) How many sad hearts it has made. Poor Mrs. Bheu is so distressed. It seems as though she cannot be consoled. You have doubtless heard of the death of Mr. Neal. Our community has sustained a great loss, in losing him. He was one of the most&#8221;

[Page 4]

&#8220;useful and enterprising men here. I feel that I have lost my best friend in Macon. No father could have been kinder than he was. Thus one friend after another departs. But how comforting and consoling the thought that there is one friend who will never leave us. If we only trust in him. I have an opportunity of sending this letter today by one of the Macon Grays, who has been home on the sick list for some time. I am going to write cousin Mary in a few days though I am not in her debt. I should be truly glad to hear from you every time, you have leisure to write. I know you are kept very busy and have little time for writing. Wishing you a &#8220;Happy New Year&#8221; and hoping that you may be preserved from all the ills and dangers of war. I am truly your friend &amp; cousin.

<dc:description>Four-page letter from Beck Wallace to her cousin, Samuel Latta, of the 13th Tennessee Infantry, CSA, makes reference to her war work, particularly a concert she has helped organize in Macon to benefit the Southern Mothers in Memphis. She writes of a dull Christmas, the closing of a year of suffering, and prayers for a better year to come. She relates that she may have to leave her teaching position at a small school in Macon because collections cannot be made to pay the teachers.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Southern Mothers Association of Memphis set up the noted Southern Mothers Hospital in June 1861. The hospital would come to reside in the Irving Block and possess a 400-patient capacity before merging with the Overton Hospital in December 1861 and forming the official Overton Military Hospital.  Numerous sales, concerts, and festivals benefitted the Society of Southern Mothers, and donations to support their charitable efforts came from all over the South.</dc:description>
