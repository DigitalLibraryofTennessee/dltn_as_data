<dc:title>Correspondence from Mary Dedman to Tommie Williams, March 13, 1865</dc:title>
<dc:relation>&#8220;Selma March 13th, 1865

Dear Tommie

	I received your letter several days ago. While out at Jane&#8217;s, and would have answered it immediately, but had no writing material out there with me. Consequently had to defer writing until I came home. I received three other letters the same day I received yours, but was very much disappointed that among them was not one from my dear husband. I fear if you had witnessed the disappointment expressed by my countenance, you would have thought that your letter was not receiving a very cordial reception; but not so. I was as happy to receive it and it afforded me as much pleasure as a letter from any other person, save my husband, could have done. When I tell you that it is now more than a month since I heard from him I know you will not blame me for feeling disappointed that I did not receive a letter from his also. I was sorry to hear that you had been sick, hope you will not have the misfortune to be sick again. At least in the State of Georgia, as the people there are so little disposed to accommodate soldiers. I am glad that you and Billie succeeded in overtaking the wagons, but I think it will be some time before you reach the other portion of your command. If it is, as I suppose in front of Sherman. It is rumored that we now have Sherman in a close place and will probably capture him. But we have so many rumors that we do not know when to consider them reliable. An attack on Mobile is now threatened. There are twenty four vessels inside the bay and in sight of the city. Our authorities seem to be confidant of their ability to hold the city. God grant that they may be. For if they capture Mobile they can very easily come to Selma in their Gunboats while the river is so high. There are many inducements for them to come to this place. Among others, the release of the Yankee prisoners who are now here. We have a large number of them here. They were brought from Cahaba, in consequence of their prison being submerged with the water from the Ala. River. Before our authorities could succeed in getting boats to bring them off, the water rose several feet in the prison and they were necessarily compelled to stand in it until the Boats could come to their relief. There were several boats lying at the wharf, but they could get no wood as the freshet had washed away all the wood on the river. When this news reaches the North, I fear they will use it as a pretext for inflicting some additional cruelties on our prisoners. Many families in Selma fared as badly as they did. A great portion of East Selma was submerged and the families had to evacuate their houses.
	Last Friday was observed here by a majority of the people as a day of fasting and prayer, and I hope was so observed throughout the Confederacy. I have great faith in the efficacy of prayer and I believe God will hear and answer the prayers of His people and grant us peace with liberty and independence. It is rumored that two other Commissioners, Singleton and Hughes, have been sent from Washington to Richmond. I do not know the object of their mission. If it is to negotiate a peace, God grant that they may be successful.
	Has Willie recovered from the spell of enchantment which the Georgia young lady threw over him? She must have been very attractive or Willie very susceptible, to have been made such an easy conquest of. Did matters progress as far with them as they did with you and the sentimental young lady from whom you received that famous letter?  Tommie I am &#8220;taking  it for granted&#8221; that you are sincere when you say you do not object to long letters and am stretching this to a pretty good length. You flatter me, though, when you say you trust to gather some ideas from a correspondence with me. I am but a plain, matter of fact letter writer and do not profess to be capable of interesting those in whom I am not myself interested. Having for you the affection of a relative, I expect to write to you as such and wish I were capable of writing such letters as would be both beneficial and instructive to you. Lori says she will answer your letter in a few days. I hope to hear from both you and Willie again soon. All join me in love to you, and Bettie sends you a kiss. Write soon.
		Yours affectionately
