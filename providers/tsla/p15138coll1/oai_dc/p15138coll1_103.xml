<dc:title>Correspondence from Arthur H. Harris to George Carroll Harris, November 11, 1860</dc:title>
<dc:description>Letter from Arthur H. Harris to his brother George Carroll Harris in Nashville.  He writes of the pervading excitement that has surrounded the 1860 presidential election in his area. Though he is glad the contest is over, he acknowledges the death of the Democratic Party, the long-standing absence of democracy and Republican form of government in the country, and the inability of the American people to self govern. His comments about the plans of Civil War are indeed prophetic.</dc:description>
