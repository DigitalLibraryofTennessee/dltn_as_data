				&#8220;Monroe La. June 21st 61

Dear George
	Your telegraphic dispatch of the 15th was not received until a moment ago. Owing to my absence from home for the past week. I have been off on another recruiting expedition &amp; have just returned to Town, dirty, dusty, &amp; tired. I will therefore reply briefly to your enquiries &amp; go home for a bath &amp; a light colored linen. However I rather think that the information you seek was given in a letter I mailed to you about 10 days since. &amp; it ought to have reached you by this time. If not within a day or two after your dispatch was sent off. Mike is in the 2nd Louisiana Regt. under the Command of Col De.Russy of Red River. They were stationed at Yorktown Va at last account &amp; eager for a fuss of some kind or other. The cannons firing at Great Bethel were heard by the boys at Yorktown (10 miles distant) &amp; they immediately hurried on there in double quick time but did not arrive at the battle ground until about an hour after the fun was all over. They hate it very much&#8221;

&#8220;As to the Chaplaincey. There is no prospect of forming the Regt here to which I alluded in a former letter. At the time I wrote I was confident the project would go through like a flash &amp; I was anxious to get you in the same Regt with me. But as you cannot be with me I would like for you to be with Mike &amp; my impression is that that Regt has no Chaplain. However if that place is filled dont be in a hurry. We are going to have a long war! Many new Regts will yet have to be formed. I shall be in some one of them &amp; will put your name forward then if you are not engaged. Dont be in too much haste to accept the position among entire strangers. I am getting along slowly but surely with my Rifle Company. Am not in too much hurry. Because I am satisfied those fanatics of the North will be fools enough to give us all a chance. They intend to annoy &amp; harass us for years. I wont say fight us, because I believe that the cowardly set will run every time after they have had 2 or 3 good dressings down. I know we can whip the infernal rascals &amp; drive them back to the mysterious caverns of Yankeedom &amp; we must do it at the risk of all that is dear to us. Adieu
			Your Aff Bro

<dc:description>Two-page letter from Arthur H. Harris of Monroe, Louisiana, to his brother George Carroll Harris of Nashville.  He writes of his recruiting expedition and his rifle company, of recruits hankering for action, of George's desire for a chaplaincy, and of predicted Northern cowardice in the face of battle.</dc:description>

<dc:description>An earlier letter in this collection finds Arthur's dad Elisha rushing to Monroe and spending a week dissauding Aruthur from enlisting following the firing on Fort Sumter. Arthur had to be reminded that his family obligations came first at this juncture of the war. Here we see he has contented himself with recruiting and a local rifle company. George Carroll Harris would secure a posotion as Chaplain in the Confederate Army in 1862.</dc:description>
