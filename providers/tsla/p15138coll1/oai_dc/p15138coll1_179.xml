&#8220;of a woman&#8217;s ability to travel when in the family way. but I know that Mary was not able to travel after the last of April a distance of 1200 or 1500 miles with safety. Had you not urged me to retain my place here as long as possible and continued to do so until it was too late to leave I would have left the 1st of April.
	Mary was not confined until the 28th of July and she is not able to start yet.

&#8220;both lately been gutted and their contents burned and scattered, and the editors imprisoned and branded as traitors on account of favoring the South.

	Mary joins me in love to you all &amp; Eleanor sends greetings.
