<dc:description>As a legal document, an oath represents a sworn declaration taking place in front of an authorized individual.  In this case, the loyalty oath represents sworn allegiance to the Union by a civilian at a Union Provost Marshal's Office.  Such oaths were initially used for military and Federal government employment purposes but were broadened in scope to tackle the far-reaching issues of loyalty during this turbulent period in the nation's history.</dc:description>
