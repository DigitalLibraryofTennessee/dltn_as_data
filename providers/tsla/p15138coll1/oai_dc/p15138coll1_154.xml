<dc:title>Correspondence from Thomas Crutchfield, Jr. to James R. Hood, December 27, 1863</dc:title>
<dc:description>Letter from Thomas Crutchfield Jr. to James R. Hood.  Crutchfield makes an effort to prove his loyalty to the Union by recounting his opposition to secession, his informing the Federals of troop movements, his supplying of the Union army with mules, corn, hay, and oats, and the decimation of his property. At the same time, he has also been busy springing his brother from a Confederate prison, avoiding conscription into the Confederate Army, and using his connections to Confederate officers to gain favors.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Crutchfield sold his popular Chattanooga hotel, the Crutchfield House, in 1861 to remove himself from the center of the conflict, but even so his loyalty was questioned throughout the war. He side-stepped conscription by obtaining a substitute. He states that he "chose to remain quiet and act prudently" and expresses faith in his ability to "engineer through it."  Crutchfield is using Hood, a volunteer aide to several Federal military leaders, as a go-between to convey his sympathies to the authorities.</dc:description>
