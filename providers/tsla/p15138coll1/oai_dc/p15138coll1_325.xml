<dc:description>J. S. Burrow writes his brother from Chester County detailing his financial problems, his inability to collect money until cotton comes to market, his desire to move from Jacks Creek for better money-making opportunities, and his fear that he will eventually have to enter military service.  He  contends General Pillow will re-take Ft. Henry if he can muster enough troops.  He notes that unconfirmed rumors state Pillow has whipped the enemy at Fort Donelson.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The Confederate earthworks protecting the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers fell to Federal troops in February 1862.  The attack from Union ironclads brought down Fort Henry on February 6, 1862, prior to the arrival of Federal soldiers overland.  A longer battle involving both army and navy was required to bring down Fort Donelson on February 16, 1862.  Thus, the North had its first major victory and entre into the heart of the South.</dc:description>
