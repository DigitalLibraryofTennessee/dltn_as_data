<dc:description>This page in Mitchener's diary shows the prisoners and guards seeking cover in a trench; several German guards are pictured shooting guns. Mitchener writes, "Near Priebus, second nite out ---C'est le guerre [It's war] - Down the road, rattled a rickety wagon. Frayed nerves suggested machine-gunfire. To the woods! Goon guards opened fire! 2,000 Krieges hit the hard packed snow, and for 15-20 minutes the 'sweat' resembles July. We made it mom - Only intense cold accounted casualties."</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitchener was shot down and captured as a POW in May 1944 after a bombing mission in Germany. By early January 1945, the Red Army was getting nearer and nearer to Stalag Luft III, where Mitchener was imprisoned. Hitler had ordered the Luftwaffe to evacuate the prison camps in Silesia when he realized that they were about to be liberated by the Red Army. The men marched west, and faced a terrible blizzard. Conditions were atrocious, and some men died during the march.</dc:description>
