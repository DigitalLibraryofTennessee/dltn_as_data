<dc:description>These two pages each have a heading - "Same Monotony Until" and "Exodus Once More" but nothing has been drawn. It appears that Mitchener did not have the time to draw what he wanted under each title heading.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitchener was shot down and captured as a POW during WWII after a bombing mission in Germany. On the night of January 27, 1945, the men at Stalag Luft III were evacuated. Hitler had ordered the Luftwaffe to evacuate the prison camps that were about to be liberated by the Red Army. After a blizzard march and horrendous conditions, the men arrived in Nuremberg. Hunger was a danger, as well as Allied bombings. Eventually, the men were forced to move onwards towards Munich. They were liberated in late April.</dc:description>
