<dc:description>This page in Mitchener's diary from World War II includes a drawing of the showers at the POW camp. On the top of the image, he has written, "For 'cleanliness is next to godliness.'" Underneath the drawing, he has mentioned that the shower room is open seven days per week, "Appel to Appel." He notes, "monthly rates on request."</dc:description>

<dc:description>Hardy A. Mitchener, Jr. was captured during World War II after a bombing raid in Germany; he was sent to Stalag Luft III in Sagan (or Zagan). Life in POW camps involved insufficient food, clothing, and overcrowded living conditions.  The facilities were frequently cold and uncomfortable. Each compound at Stalag Luft III (there were five) contained around a dozen barracks (known as blocks), a cookhouse, a shower building, a laundry, and a building that served as a theater and chapel.</dc:description>
