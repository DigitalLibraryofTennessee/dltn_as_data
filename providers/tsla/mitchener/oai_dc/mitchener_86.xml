<dc:description>This page in Mitchener's POW diary from World War II shows two different images. The first is an eagle with a ball and chain on its feet. A banner, "Kriege Klarion," is pictured below the eagle, and the words, "To preserve the democratic, its contemporary" are written below this. The image appears to refer to an underground POW news bulletin or something similar. The second image reads, "Stalag Stump," and includes the phrases, "waiting at the gate" and "current in the Reich."</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitchener served as a second lieutenant in the 351st Bombardment Group, 8th Air Force. He was shot down and captured during World War II after a bombing mission in Germany. News at some POW camps was often distributed through underground publications,  such as POW WOW (Prisoners of War Waiting on Winning), created at Stalag Luft I. The "Kriege Klarion" may have been a similar publication. The Germans sent some POW news publications to local print shops. The POWs called themselves Kriegies.</dc:description>
