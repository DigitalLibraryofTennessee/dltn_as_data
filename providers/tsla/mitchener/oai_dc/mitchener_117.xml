<dc:description>This page in Mitchener's diary from World War II includes a drawing of the food closet. A number of cups are hanging from the wall, and a pitcher is on the floor. Mitchener writes, "As you enter the room - life's sustinence (sic) compartment...The Food Closet. By-paths for ingenuity, the clothes locker lying on its side...clothes hooks as cup racks - bread boxes from Red Cross cartons...and knife as canopener...all outlets prompted by necessity."</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitchener was captured as a POW after a bombing raid in Germany during World War II. Rations at Stalag Luft III were poor, but they were subsidized by Red Cross packages, which included cigarettes, chocolate bars, and canned food, including raisins, tuna, corned beef, sugar, jam, Spam, prunes, crackers, powdered coffee, liver pate, and condensed milk. The men were sometimes able to find creative ways to prepare the food. They were also able to adapt everyday objects to create necessary tools.</dc:description>
