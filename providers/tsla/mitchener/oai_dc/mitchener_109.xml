<dc:description>This page includes a drawing of a newsroom. Mitchener has drawn a world map that is posted on a blackboard. Underneath the title, "News Room," he has listed three categories: "Latest News," "From the Front," and "Kriege Rules." The "Latest News" section reads, "Slightly Altered - Illustrated stories of political, war-torn countries of Europe." The "From the Front" section reads, "Anglo-Americans repulsed. Bolshevists repulsed. Escape is no longer a sport." The last section probably refers to compliance with the Third Geneva Convention (1929) governing the treatment of POWs.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitchener served as a second lieutenant in the 8th Air Force. He was shot down and captured as a POW during World War II after a bombing mission in Germany. POWs often obtained their news through secretly distributed, underground publications, such as POW WOW (Prisoners of War Waiting on Winning), created at Stalag Luft I. Other news was obtained through Allied and German radio broadcasts. When war news arrived, information was posted on large handmade maps that hung from the walls of the blocks.</dc:description>
