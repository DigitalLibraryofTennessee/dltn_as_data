<dc:description>This page in Mitchener's POW diary from World War II shows the remainder of the song, "Thanks for the Memoires," which begins on the previous page of the diary. Another song, "Kriege Rations," is also shown. This song makes light of the fact that the prisoners are frequently hungry and the food choices are poor. It is a parody of "Stormy Weather."</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitchener served as a second lieutenant in the 509th Bombardment Squadron, 351st Bombardment Group, 8th Air Force. He was shot down during World War II after a bombing mission in Germany; he was captured and sent to Stalag Luft III. Life as an American POW in Germany involved hunger, cold, boredom, and overcrowded conditions. Rations were bland and generally inadequate, but were sometimes supplemented by food that arrived in Red Cross parcels. Men often received one parcel per week.</dc:description>
