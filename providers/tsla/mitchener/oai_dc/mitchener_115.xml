<dc:description>This page in Mitchener's diary from World War II includes a drawing of the interior of a POW barrack. A row of doors can be seen. Mitchener has written, "On the left - the 'little girls' room' - as you enter...The Front Door. The hall is swept, at least once per week- Rumor has it daily - On Saturday the brass gives us a once over - following a fanfare of polishing and scrubbing."</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitchener was shot down and captured as a POW during World War II after a bombing mission in Germany. Each compound at Stalag Luft III (there were five) contained around a dozen barracks called blocks, a cookhouse, a shower building, a laundry, a theater and a chapel building. A barracks building housed about 150 men. There were about twelve to fifteen sleeping rooms in each barrack, which were furnished with benches, lockers, a table, and double or triple bunk beds. Conditions were inadequate.</dc:description>
