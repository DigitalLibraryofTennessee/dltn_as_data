<dc:description>Hardy A. Mitchener, Jr. was captured during World War II after a bombing mission in Germany. He was sent to Stalag Luft III, a POW camp in Silesia (Sagan, Germany), where American and RAF (Royal Air Force) prisoners frequently suffered from hunger, insufficient clothing, and crowded living conditions. Rations were slim, but the prisoners were given Red Cross parcels which provided extra food. The camp cookhouse, run by "combines" (groups of 4-12 POWs) supplied one cooked ration a day, usually barley soup.</dc:description>
