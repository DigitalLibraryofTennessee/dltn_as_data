<dc:description>Hardy A. Mitchener, Jr. was shot down and captured as a POW during World War II after a bombing mission in Germany. He was sent to Stalag Luft III in Sagan, Germany. Stalag Luft III was originally opened in April 1942 as a camp for RAF airmen. Later, by 1944, many of the prisoners were American fliers. The RAF airmen were located in the North and South compounds of the prison, whereas the Americans lived in the East Central, and West compounds. About 10,000 were imprisoned by 1944.</dc:description>
