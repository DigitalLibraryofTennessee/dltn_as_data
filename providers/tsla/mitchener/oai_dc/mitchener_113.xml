<dc:description>This page in Mitchener's POW diary from World War II includes a drawing of a prisoner who is imagining a better place - a house to live in, rather than a German POW camp. Mitchener writes, "There are sundry others - space dictates - - and lack of ability incurs limitations -- so with -- Thoughts of one far better -- We return - opposite." The prisoner is wearing old, tattered clothing, and looks bedraggled.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitchener was shot down during World War II after a bombing mission in Germany. POWs often suffered from depression during their internment. This was referred to as "barbed wire disease." When the men were captured, they were frequently told, "For you the war is over." The men were frustrated that they could no longer participate in the war effort. In order to confound the Germans, they frequently attempted to escape. POWs usually felt demoralized and frustrated, and they longed for freedom.</dc:description>
