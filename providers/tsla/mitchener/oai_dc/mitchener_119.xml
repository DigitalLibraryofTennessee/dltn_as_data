<dc:description>This page in Mitchener's diary includes a drawing of the kitchen, in which a large cooking stove is pictured. On top of this image, he has written a number of commonly used phrases, including,"shut the d - ' door!" and "The skillet's dirty again!" He writes, "Once per day there is sufficient food to warrant allotment of 1 hour's cooking time to each room...quantity sufficient to require the time of two 'cooks.' Ah what fond dreams!" He then lists more details about foods and cleaning needs.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitchener was captured as a POW after a bombing raid in Germany during World War II. Rations at Stalag Luft III were poor, but they were subsidized by Red Cross packages. The men were sometimes able to find creative ways to prepare the food. They were also able to adapt everyday objects to create necessary tools for cooking and other tasks. The communal kitchen contained two coal-burning stoves. Men of lower rank tended to take care of the cleaning, washing and cooking.</dc:description>
