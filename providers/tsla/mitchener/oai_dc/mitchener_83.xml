<dc:description>Mitchener was shot down during World War II after a bombing mission in Germany; he was captured and sent to Stalag Luft III. Life as a POW in Germany involved hunger, cold, boredom, and overcrowded conditions.  The three-story wooden sentry towers seen here were known as "Goon Boxes" and were located at the perimeter of the compounds. Stalag Luft III was the site of the famous Great Escape, in which 80 POWs attempted to escape in late March 1944; Hitler later ordered the execution of 50 escapees.</dc:description>
