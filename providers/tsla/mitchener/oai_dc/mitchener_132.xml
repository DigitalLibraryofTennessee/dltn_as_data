<dc:description>This is another page of the Christmas program that was given to the POWs at Stalag Luft III in 1944. It includes the lyrics to "O Little Town of Bethlehem" and "O Come All Ye Faithful." The program lists carols performed by the "troubador group" on Christmas Eve and community carol singing at the south end of the theater at midnight.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitchener was shot down and captured as a POW after a bombing mission in Germany and sent to Stalag Luft III in Sagan, Germany, now a part of Poland. Christmas Day in 1944 at Stalag Luft III was cold but clear. The men were given Red Cross parcels with canned turkey, cookies, and plum pudding. The Germans gave them party hats and noisemakers, but the atmosphere was still grim. The Western troops were stalled along the Siegfried Line, and the men feared that they would be prisoners indefinitely.</dc:description>
