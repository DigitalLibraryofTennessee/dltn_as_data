<dc:description>This page in Mitchener's POW diary from World War II includes a drawing of a tree as well as a number of tree stumps, all within the POW camp boundaries. He writes, "Around the compound - approximately a dozen...Trees. About the Reich, 'tis rumored, abound; forests...rich in foliage and 'freedom.' Up on that broad bosom is reflected the promise of a free world, enrichened by a people who's [sic] devotion is claimed by a peace everlasting."</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitchener was shot down during World War II after a bombing mission in Germany. POWs often suffered from depression during their internment. This was referred to as "barbed wire disease." When the men were captured, they were frequently told, "For you the war is over." The men were frustrated that they could no longer participate in the war effort. In order to confound the Germans, they frequently attempted to escape. POWs usually felt demoralized and frustrated, and they longed for freedom.</dc:description>
