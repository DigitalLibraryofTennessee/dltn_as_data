<dc:description>This is another page of the Christmas program that was given to the POWs at Stalag Luft III in 1944. It includes a dedication page that reads, "The Senior American Officer extends very cordial season's greetings to all officers and men under his command," and is signed Da[rr] H. Alki[ns]. The program includes Christmas Eve and Christmas Day church services (Protestant and Roman Catholic) on which Mitchener has written,"Our Entertainment - Yultide" at the top of the leaf.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitchener was shot down and captured as a POW after a bombing mission in Germany and sent to Stalag Luft III in Sagan, Germany, now a part of Poland. Christmas Day in 1944 at Stalag Luft III was cold but clear. The men were given Red Cross parcels with canned turkey, cookies, and plum pudding. The Germans gave them party hats and noisemakers, but the atmosphere was still grim. The Western troops were stalled along the Siegfried Line, and the men feared that they would be prisoners indefinitely.</dc:description>
