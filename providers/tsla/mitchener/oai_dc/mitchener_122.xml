<dc:description>Mitchener was shot down and captured during World War II after a bombing mission in Germany. He was sent to Stalag Luft III, which was located in Zagan, Poland (at the time, a part of Germany). The men were aware of the progress of Stalin's forces through radio broadcasts, underground newspapers, and newly arrived prisoners. Stalin initiated the Red Army's winter offensive on the morning of January 12, 1945. They arrived in Silesia eight days later, thus depriving the Germans of a rich source of coal.</dc:description>
