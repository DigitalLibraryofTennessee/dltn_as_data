<dc:description>Mitchener was shot down and captured after a bombing mission in Germany and sent to Stalag Luft III in Sagan, Germany, now a part of Poland.  Christmas Day in 1944 at Stalag Luft III was cold but clear. The men were given Red Cross parcels with canned turkey, cookies, and plum pudding. The Germans gave them party hats and noisemakers, but the atmosphere was still grim. The Allied troops were stalled along the Siegfried Line, and the men feared that they would be prisoners indefinitely.</dc:description>
