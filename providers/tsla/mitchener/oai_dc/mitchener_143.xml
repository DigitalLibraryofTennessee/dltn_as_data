<dc:description>This page is a poem or list of things that Mitchener misses and craves during his imprisonment in a POW camp in Germany. He has then included a small poem that reads,"I have loved those things/Gentle living our country gave/You'll find them where freedom rings/Land of the free, home of the brave." He has also included some tiny drawings that accompany the longer poem, which include pictures of Cupid, an old woman's head, a flag, a mask, a cup of coffee, a steak, a deck of cards, and coins, etc.</dc:description>
