<dc:description>Mitchener was shot down during World War II after a bombing mission in Germany; he was sent to the POW camp Stalag Luft III. Blank journals were given to soldiers through the War Prisoners Aid of the Young Men's Christian Association. In 1939, the World's Committee of the YMCA, which was headquartered in Geneva, established the War Prisoners Aid so that the recreational, educational, and spiritual needs of prisoners could be met. The International Red Cross Committee provided books for prisoners.</dc:description>
