<dc:description>This page in Mitchener's POW diary from World War II shows a song along with a tiny illustration of a soldier in prison. The song is called "Thanks for the Memories" and is attributed to L. G. Young, POW. The song is a parody and makes light of the uncomfortable aspects of being a prisoner. The song continues on the next page.</dc:description>
