<dc:description>Second Lieutenant Hardy A. Mitchener, Jr. of 351st Bombardment Group, 8th Air Force was shot down during World War II after a bombing mission in Germany. After Allied prisoners were captured, they were first sent to Dulag Luft for processing. Although Germany was expected to uphold the 1929 Geneva Convention, prisoners at Dulag Luft were often treated poorly and put into solitary confinement. From there, they were shipped to the various Stalag Luft camps throughout Germany.</dc:description>
