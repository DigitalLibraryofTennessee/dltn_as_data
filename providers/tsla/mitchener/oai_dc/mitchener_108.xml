<dc:description>Hardy A. Mitchener, Jr. was captured during World War II after a bombing raid in Germany. Life at POW camps involved insufficient food and overcrowded living conditions.  One of the institutions created by the prisoners was the "Foodaco."  This "Stalag Swap Shop" was located in the camp cookhouse. Red Cross food was exchanged through a barter system, in which cigarettes were used as the primary means of exchange. Each item had its own price or point value. "Foodaco" was an abbreviation of  "food account."</dc:description>
