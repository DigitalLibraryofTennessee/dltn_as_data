<dc:description>Hardy A. Mitchener, Jr. was captured as a POW in Germany after a bombing raid during World War II.  He was sent to Stalag Luft III, the prison camp made famous by the failed "Great Escape" that took place before Mitchener arrived. In order to fight boredom, depression, and uncomfortable living conditions, the men at the camp devised recreational activities such as music and theatre. They were provided with YMCA instruments, and established orchestras with names such as the "Sagan Serenaders."</dc:description>
