<dc:description>This page in Mitchener's diary from World War II includes a drawing of a stage, on which he has written, "Hereon have appeared backdrops - Remarkable in that they were constructed with very few materials...much ingenuity." Under productions, he lists "happy hour," "one act plays," "barrel o'fun," and "minstrel show." He also lists movies, which include "Orchestra Wives," "Dixie Dugan,"  and "Corsican Brothers."</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitchener was captured as a POW and sent to Stalag Luft III during WWII. Theater groups were very popular at all of the Luft camps. Materials were supplied by the YMCA, so Kriegies (POWs) were able to make costumes and stage scenery. They made theater seats from Red Cross food crates. Tin cans could be used to make chandeliers. The men formed musical groups (using YMCA instruments) such as the "Sagan Serenaders." The YMCA also provided playbooks, but prisoners also wrote and produced their own plays.</dc:description>
