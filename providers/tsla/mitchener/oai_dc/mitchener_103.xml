<dc:description>Hardy A. Mitchener, Jr. was captured during World War II after a bombing mission in Germany. He was sent to Stalag Luft III, a POW camp in Silesia. Libraries were available at the camp, as well as a "college" known as "Sagan U." directed by the prisoners. The "school" had about 40 classes, including chemistry, math, physics, philosophy, Latin, literature, history, auto mechanics, marketing, accounting, printing, and bodybuilding. Classes were taught by prisoners. The YMCA supplied blackboards and notebooks.</dc:description>
