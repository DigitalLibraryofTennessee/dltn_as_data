<dc:description>This page in Mitchener's diary shows a bedroom in what appears to be a private home. One prisoner can be seen by the bed, resting. Mitchener writes,"About thirteen hours later &amp; 29 km. -- 'Resting a Bit' - In the hamlet of Freiwaldau, the caravan halted for 5 hours. No shelter provided, the Krieges sought their own. A driving blizzard outside - in surroundings as above yours truly warmed, ate EGGS &amp; HAM w/special attention of true German hospitality - A truly good and pleasant woman. All delicious!</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitchener was shot down and captured as a POW in May 1944 after a bombing mission in Germany. By early January 1945, the Red Army was getting nearer and nearer to Stalag Luft III, where Mitchener was imprisoned. Hitler had ordered the Luftwaffe to evacuate the prison camps in Silesia when he realized that they were about to be liberated by the Red Army. The men marched west, and faced a terrible blizzard. At night, the prisoners slept at any housing they could locate, including civilian areas.</dc:description>
