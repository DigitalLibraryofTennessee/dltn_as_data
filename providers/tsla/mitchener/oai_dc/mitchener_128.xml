<dc:description>This page in Mitchener's diary shows a drawing of two train cars with "40 Hommes 8 Cheveaux"(40 men 8 horses) written on one of the cars. Mitchener writes,"As you approach the 'Zug' [train] Yards - Spremburg---'Board!' Fifty-six men per car--Hardly room for Red Cross parcels..Three days..nights across Germany. If only those G-I airmen weren't so damned eager. Guaranteed ventilation."</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitchener was shot down and captured as a POW in May 1944 after a bombing mission in Germany. By early 1945, the Red Army was getting nearer and nearer to Stalag Luft III, where Mitchener was imprisoned. Hitler had ordered the Luftwaffe to evacuate the prison camps in Silesia. The men marched west, and faced a terrible blizzard; conditions were atrocious. From Spremberg the men were to be shipped by rail to eastern Bavaria. Conditions in the boxcars were "unspeakably hideous," according to one POW.</dc:description>
