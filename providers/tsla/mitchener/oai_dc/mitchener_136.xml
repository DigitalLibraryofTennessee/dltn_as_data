<dc:description>This page is blank except for a drawing of a military tank that has been cut out from another sheet of paper and placed in the diary. Underneath the tank, Mitchener has written, "From the West" and "Lt. Hardy A. Mitchener." In addition to the drawing, there is a tiny piece of silver paper inserted here.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitchener was shot down and captured as a POW after a bombing mission in Germany and sent to Stalag Luft III in Sagan, Germany. The men kept abreast of Allied progress through radio broadcasts, newly arrived prisoners, and underground newspapers. Radio parts could be obtained through bribing German guards. The prisoners were sometimes able to obtain coveted goods such as cigarettes and chocolate through their Red Cross parcels. These items could be used for exchange on the black market.</dc:description>
