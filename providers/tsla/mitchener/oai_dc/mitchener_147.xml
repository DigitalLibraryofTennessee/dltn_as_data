<dc:description>This image was drawn by Hardy A. Mitchener, Jr. in the diary that he received during his stay at a German prisoner of war camp. It pictures an airman, probably Mitchener himself, falling out of the sky in a parachute. His plane has been shot down, and a fire is visible in the background where his plane has crashed. Two signs are pictured, one which reads, "Welcome to Sagan, City of 2000 Dreams," and the other reads, "To Dulag Registration Center." Mitchener is about to be taken prisoner.</dc:description>
