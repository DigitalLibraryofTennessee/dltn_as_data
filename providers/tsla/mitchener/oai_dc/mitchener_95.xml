<dc:description>This page in Mitchener's POW diary from World War II shows calendar images, each with a particular date enlarged and circled. He has drawn images next to the calendar pages, including a picture of a track and field athlete, a soldier, a minstrel singer, and a Russian soldier, indicated with the heading,"Uncle Joe." The drawings are tiny and intricate, and show a subtle use of detail and design. In the bottom right corner, the word "armistice" and a question mark can be seen.</dc:description>
