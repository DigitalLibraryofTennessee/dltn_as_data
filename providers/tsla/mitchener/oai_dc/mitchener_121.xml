<dc:description>This page in Mitchener's diary shows three sinks in a bathroom at the POW camp. On the top of the page, he writes, "Pursuit of the daily 'facial'--" Underneath the picture, he has written, "'Thru these pipes pass the coldest water in Germany.' August heat alters it not at all - The stove for purposes of inventory only, and throws nothing. 3 on a side accommodate 140 inmates w/washing for each, basins. The summertime shower room, and winter spit-bath equivalent."</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitchener was shot down and captured as a POW during World War II after a bombing mission in Germany. Each compound at Stalag Luft III (there were five) contained around a dozen barracks called blocks, a cookhouse, a shower building, a laundry, a theater and a chapel building. The winters in Silesia were notoriously cold, and the men were provided with insufficient heat. As a result, the POWs were frequently cold and uncomfortable. Living conditions were generally inadequate.</dc:description>
