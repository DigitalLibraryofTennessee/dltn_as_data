<dc:description>Mitchener was shot down and captured as a POW after a bombing mission in Germany and sent to Stalag Luft III in Sagan, Germany, now a part of Poland. Mail for prisoners was greatly delayed, as it had to pass through American censors. Mitchener's mother, Estelle Mitchener, was living in Nashville, Tennessee, when she sent her son a package of unknown contents. Estelle, who died in 1967, lived longer than her son, who died in America in 1957. Mitchener's father also outlived him, and died in 1964.</dc:description>
