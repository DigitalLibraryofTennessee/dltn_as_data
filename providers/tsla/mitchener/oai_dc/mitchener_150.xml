<dc:description>Hardy A. Mitchener, Jr. was shot down and captured as a POW during World War II after a bombing mission in Germany. He was sent to Stalag Luft III in Sagan, Germany. Stalag Luft III was originally opened in April 1942 as a camp for RAF airmen. Later, by 1944, many of the prisoners were American fliers. About 10,000 men were imprisoned by late 1944. Mitchener obtained contact information for some of his fellow prisoners; it is not known if he met with any of them after the war.</dc:description>
