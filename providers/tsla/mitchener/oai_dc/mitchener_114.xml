<dc:description>This page in Mitchener's POW diary from World War II includes a drawing of wooden barrack #170. Mitchener describes his quarters as including ten rooms, housing 8-14 men each. He writes,"Constructed of wood, plaster, and tarpaper - a few bolts - a sprinkling of nails - and preserved with 'sand.' Heated by ersatz coal...but damn' damp and cold! Not quite like home."</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitchener was shot down and captured as a POW during World War II after a bombing mission in Germany. Each compound at Stalag Luft III (there were five) contained around a dozen barracks called blocks, a cookhouse, a shower building, a laundry, a theater and a chapel building. A barracks building housed about 150 men. There were about twelve to fifteen sleeping rooms in each barrack, which were furnished with benches, lockers, a table, and double or triple bunk beds. Lighting was poor.</dc:description>
