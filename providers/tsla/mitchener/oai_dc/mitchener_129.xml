<dc:description>These two pages each have a heading - "Kriege Relief" and "In the Dark of Night - Nuenberg," but nothing has been drawn. It appears that what Mitchener calls "Nuenberg" is the city of Nuremberg in south central Germany.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Mitchener was shot down and captured as a POW during World War II after a bombing mission in Germany. On the night of January 27, 1945, the men at Stalag Luft III were evacuated. One of the senior officers announced, "The goons have...given us 30 minutes to be at the front gate. Get your stuff together and line up." Hitler had ordered the Luftwaffe to evacuate the prison camps that were about to be liberated by the Red Army. After a blizzard march and horrendous conditions, the men arrived in Nuremberg.</dc:description>
