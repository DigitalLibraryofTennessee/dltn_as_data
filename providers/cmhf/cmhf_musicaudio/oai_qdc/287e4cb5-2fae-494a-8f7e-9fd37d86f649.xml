<dc:title>Hank Williams Compilation by Jack Spiegel (Tape 2)</dc:title>
<dc:description>This recording is a compilation of Hank Williams songs from Jack Spiegel of Formoso, Kansas, sent to Hank Snow. The tape is not dated. Included in the tape's box are two pieces of cardboard inserts with a handwritten song list and a note that this is tape two. The inserts state there was supposed to be a second side but no such side exists, the tape only has one side. The insert for side one includes "My Heart Would Know" but that is not on this recording. Instead, the song "Foggy Foggy Dew" has been recorded even though it was not included on either insert. This tape is forty-six of an unidentified number of tapes.</dc:description>
