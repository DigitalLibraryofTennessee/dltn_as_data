<dc:title>Miss Pettingill Proposes - 1940-02-20</dc:title>
<dc:description>WSM program Miss Pettingill Proposes. Announcer David Cobb and Miss Pettingill host a "radio column of the air", answering listener letters with advice, and featuring musical interludes. The label appears to be dated 1940-02-20 (Tuesday), however it is announced that the day is a Monday and the "2" on the label is somewhat questionable - the only month of 1940 where the 20th fell on a Monday is May, meaning a possible date of 1940-05-20 (unconfirmed).</dc:description>
