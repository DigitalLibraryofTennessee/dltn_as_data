<dc:title>Hank Thompson Show (KWTX) - 1946-08-29</dc:title>
<dc:description>Hank Thompson radio show for KWTX, Waco, TX sponsored by Frontier Jewelers. Originally broadcast 1946-08-29 (unconfirmed, year based on performances and mention of 'Night Train To Memphis', month based on Hank's mention of 'Thursday the 29th', suggesting August for the year of 1946), though Hank's comments suggest the program was recorded a day in advance of broadcast. Hank mentions he is to appear with Eddy Arnold that evening in Temple, Texas. Announcer referred to as Bob, likely Robert Charles (unconfirmed).</dc:description>
