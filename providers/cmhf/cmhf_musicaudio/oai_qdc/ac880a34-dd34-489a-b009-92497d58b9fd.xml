<dc:title>Mid-Day Merry-Go-Round - 18th Anniversary clips [incomplete]</dc:title>
<dc:description>Two clips taken from the 18th anniversary celebration of radio station WNOX's program Mid-Day Merry-Go-Round, featuring Lowell Blanchard, announcer Jerry (last name unknown), a performance by Eddie Hill, and a conversation with Mr. Hugh Fielden. The disc originally contained three clips, however the first was not transferable due to considerable missing lacquer. Clips two and three were transferred in reverse order to prevent further damage to the disc (see label info for original track order).</dc:description>
