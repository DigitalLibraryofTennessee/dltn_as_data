<dc:title>All Star Western Theatre - 1947-mm-dd (Jimmy Wakely guests) - Part 1</dc:title>
<dc:description>Part 1 of All Star Western Theatre radio program. Broadcast date unknown, date on label and sleeve is likely a record date as it does not fit in sequence with other programs. CMF collection is missing programs for September 20, and September 27 of 1947, therefore these are possibly broadcast dates (unconfirmed). Featuring Foy Willing and the Riders Of The Purple Sage, with announcer Terry O'Sullivan (unconfirmed), and guest Jimmy Wakely.</dc:description>
