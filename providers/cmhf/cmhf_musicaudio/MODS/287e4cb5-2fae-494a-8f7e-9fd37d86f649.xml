The tape is not dated. Included in the tape's box are two pieces of cardboard inserts with a handwritten song list and a note that this is tape two. The inserts state there was supposed to be a second side but no such side exists, the tape only has one side. The insert for side one includes "My Heart Would Know" but that is not on this recording. Instead, the song "Foggy Foggy Dew" has been recorded even though it was not included on either insert. This tape is forty-six of an unidentified number of tapes.</abstract><subject><topic>Williams, Hank, 1923-1953</topic></subject><name><namePart>Hank Williams</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text" valueURI="http://id.loc.gov/vocabular/relators/cre">Creator</roleTerm></role></name><name><namePart/><role><roleTerm type="text" valueURI="http://id.loc.gov/vocabular/relators/cre">Creator</roleTerm></role></name><identifier type="local">RT-7-02576_1</identifier><location><url usage="primary" access="object in context">http://digi.countrymusichalloffame.org/cdm/ref/collection/musicaudio/id/9584</url><url access="preview">http://digi.countrymusichalloffame.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/musicaudio/id/9584</url></location><physicalDescription><form>1/4 inch -- 1 full track</form></physicalDescription><physicalDescription><form>7.5 ips</form></physicalDescription><recordInfo><recordContentSource>Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum</recordContentSource><recordChangeDate>2023-05-08-04:00</recordChangeDate><languageOfCataloging><languageTerm type="code" authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></languageOfCataloging><recordOrigin>Record has been transformed into MODS v3.5 from a Qualified Dublin Core record by the Digital Library of Tennessee, a service hub of the Digital Public Library of America.</recordOrigin></recordInfo></mods>
