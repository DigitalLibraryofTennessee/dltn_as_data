This disc includes master takes for numbers 1, 2, and 3, which were dubbed from other discs (see also TR001666 and TR001662). This take of "Nobody Cares (For Me Anymore)" appears to be the master for Majestic release 6032, matrix T1495.</abstract><subject><topic>KVOO (Radio station : Tulsa, Okla.)</topic></subject><subject><topic>McAuliffe, Leon, 1917-1988</topic></subject><subject><topic>Western Swing Band (Musical group : Leon McAuliffe)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Hall, Jimmy, 1921-</topic></subject><name><namePart>Leon McAuliffe</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text" valueURI="http://id.loc.gov/vocabular/relators/cre">Creator</roleTerm></role></name><name><namePart>Western Swing Band (Leon McAuliffe)</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text" valueURI="http://id.loc.gov/vocabular/relators/cre">Creator</roleTerm></role></name><identifier type="local">TR001667_1</identifier><location><url usage="primary" access="object in context">http://digi.countrymusichalloffame.org/cdm/ref/collection/musicaudio/id/2491</url><url access="preview">http://digi.countrymusichalloffame.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/musicaudio/id/2491</url></location><physicalDescription><form>16 inch metal-based acetate disc</form></physicalDescription><physicalDescription><form>33 1/3 rpm</form></physicalDescription><recordInfo><recordContentSource>Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum</recordContentSource><recordChangeDate>2023-05-08-04:00</recordChangeDate><languageOfCataloging><languageTerm type="code" authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></languageOfCataloging><recordOrigin>Record has been transformed into MODS v3.5 from a Qualified Dublin Core record by the Digital Library of Tennessee, a service hub of the Digital Public Library of America.</recordOrigin></recordInfo></mods>
