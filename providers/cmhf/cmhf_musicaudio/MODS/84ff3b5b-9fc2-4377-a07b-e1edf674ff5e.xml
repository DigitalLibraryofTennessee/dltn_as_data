Originally broadcast 1946-08-29 (unconfirmed, year based on performances and mention of 'Night Train To Memphis', month based on Hank's mention of 'Thursday the 29th', suggesting August for the year of 1946), though Hank's comments suggest the program was recorded a day in advance of broadcast. Hank mentions he is to appear with Eddy Arnold that evening in Temple, Texas. Announcer referred to as Bob, likely Robert Charles (unconfirmed).</abstract><subject><topic>KWTX (Radio station : Waco, Tex.)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Thompson, Hank</topic></subject><subject><topic>Charles, Robert (Announcer)</topic></subject><name><namePart>Hank Thompson</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text" valueURI="http://id.loc.gov/vocabular/relators/cre">Creator</roleTerm></role></name><identifier type="local">TR000909</identifier><location><url usage="primary" access="object in context">http://digi.countrymusichalloffame.org/cdm/ref/collection/musicaudio/id/2375</url><url access="preview">http://digi.countrymusichalloffame.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/musicaudio/id/2375</url></location><physicalDescription><form>16 inch metal-based acetate disc</form></physicalDescription><physicalDescription><form>33 1/3 rpm</form></physicalDescription><recordInfo><recordContentSource>Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum</recordContentSource><recordChangeDate>2023-05-08-04:00</recordChangeDate><languageOfCataloging><languageTerm type="code" authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></languageOfCataloging><recordOrigin>Record has been transformed into MODS v3.5 from a Qualified Dublin Core record by the Digital Library of Tennessee, a service hub of the Digital Public Library of America.</recordOrigin></recordInfo></mods>
