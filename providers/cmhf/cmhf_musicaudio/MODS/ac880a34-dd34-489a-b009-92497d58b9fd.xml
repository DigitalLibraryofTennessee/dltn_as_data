The disc originally contained three clips, however the first was not transferable due to considerable missing lacquer. Clips two and three were transferred in reverse order to prevent further damage to the disc (see label info for original track order).</abstract><subject><topic>WNOX (Radio station : Knoxville, Tenn.)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Mid-day merry-go-round (Radio program)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Blanchard, Lowell, 1910-1968</topic></subject><subject><topic>Hill, Eddie, 1921-1994</topic></subject><name><namePart>Eddie Hill</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text" valueURI="http://id.loc.gov/vocabular/relators/cre">Creator</roleTerm></role></name><identifier type="local">TR000779_1</identifier><location><url usage="primary" access="object in context">http://digi.countrymusichalloffame.org/cdm/ref/collection/musicaudio/id/2160</url><url access="preview">http://digi.countrymusichalloffame.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/musicaudio/id/2160</url></location><physicalDescription><form>16 inch metal-based acetate disc</form></physicalDescription><physicalDescription><form>33 1/3 rpm</form></physicalDescription><recordInfo><recordContentSource>Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum</recordContentSource><recordChangeDate>2023-05-08-04:00</recordChangeDate><languageOfCataloging><languageTerm type="code" authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></languageOfCataloging><recordOrigin>Record has been transformed into MODS v3.5 from a Qualified Dublin Core record by the Digital Library of Tennessee, a service hub of the Digital Public Library of America.</recordOrigin></recordInfo></mods>
