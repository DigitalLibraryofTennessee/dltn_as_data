Broadcast date unknown, date on label and sleeve is likely a record date as it does not fit in sequence with other programs. CMF collection is missing programs for September 20, and September 27 of 1947, therefore these are possibly broadcast dates (unconfirmed). Featuring Foy Willing and the Riders Of The Purple Sage, with announcer Terry O'Sullivan (unconfirmed), and guest Jimmy Wakely.</abstract><subject><topic>All star western theatre (Radio program)</topic></subject><subject><topic>O'Sullivan, Terry, 1915-2006</topic></subject><subject><topic>Willing, Foy, 1914-1978</topic></subject><subject><topic>Riders of the Purple Sage</topic></subject><subject><topic>Sloey, Al</topic></subject><subject><topic>Paul, Johnny (Violinist)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Wakely, Jimmy, 1914-1982</topic></subject><name><namePart>Foy Willing</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text" valueURI="http://id.loc.gov/vocabular/relators/cre">Creator</roleTerm></role></name><name><namePart>Riders Of The Purple Sage</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text" valueURI="http://id.loc.gov/vocabular/relators/cre">Creator</roleTerm></role></name><name><namePart>Jimmy Wakely</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text" valueURI="http://id.loc.gov/vocabular/relators/cre">Creator</roleTerm></role></name><identifier type="local">TR000775</identifier><location><url usage="primary" access="object in context">http://digi.countrymusichalloffame.org/cdm/ref/collection/musicaudio/id/1972</url><url access="preview">http://digi.countrymusichalloffame.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/musicaudio/id/1972</url></location><physicalDescription><form>16 inch metal-based acetate disc</form></physicalDescription><physicalDescription><form>33 1/3 rpm</form></physicalDescription><recordInfo><recordContentSource>Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum</recordContentSource><recordChangeDate>2023-05-08-04:00</recordChangeDate><languageOfCataloging><languageTerm type="code" authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></languageOfCataloging><recordOrigin>Record has been transformed into MODS v3.5 from a Qualified Dublin Core record by the Digital Library of Tennessee, a service hub of the Digital Public Library of America.</recordOrigin></recordInfo></mods>
