  <abstract>Black and white three-quarter length portrait of Johnny Paycheck standing in front of a view of Manhattan. The photo was released by Epic Records and Buddy Lee Attractions Inc. A Rubylith masking film is taped to the photo. Handwritten notes on the back of the photo say, "Same size" and "61%," presumably in reference to the metal photoplate made from the photo. To view a poster that features the metal photoplate, see https://digi.countrymusichalloffame.org/digital/collection/hatch3/id/22120.</abstract>
