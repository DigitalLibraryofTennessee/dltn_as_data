  <abstract>Color half-length portrait of Dick Curless with a guitar. The photo was released by the Baron. On the back of the photo, a handwritten note says, " 23 4 x 4 inches 2837/1," presumably in reference to the size of the metal photoplate made from the photo. To view a poster that features the metal photoplate, see https://digi.countrymusichalloffame.org/digital/collection/hatch3/id/39367.</abstract>
