  <abstract>A black and white negative taped to and framed by a masking sheet advertising Carl Smith and containing a biography of his life and accomplishments. The press release describes Smith's early life, his start in the music business working at WROL, songs he recorded, media appearances, and his hobbies. The negative appears to be the first version of the press release, as some information is edited in version two.</abstract>
