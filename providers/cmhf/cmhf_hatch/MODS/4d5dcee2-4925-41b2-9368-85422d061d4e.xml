  <abstract>A black and white negative describing the history and accomplishments of Ben Smathers and the Stoney Mountain Cloggers, available for bookings through Moeller Talent, Inc. The press release describes the group, the style of "clog" dancing, Smathers' personal life, and his success. The missing section of the negative probably featured a photograph of the dance group. The negative would have been used to create a corresponding printing plate.</abstract>
