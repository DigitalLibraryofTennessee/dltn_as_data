  <abstract>Black and white three-quarter length portrait of Del Reeves. The photo was released by United Artist Records and Top Billing Inc. On the back of the photo, a handwritten note says, "7 3/24 x 8," presumably in reference to the size of the metal photoplate made from the photo. To view a poster that features the metal photoplate, see https://cdm17118.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/hatch3/id/22184.</abstract>
