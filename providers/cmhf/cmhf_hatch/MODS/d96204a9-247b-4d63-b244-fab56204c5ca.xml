  <abstract>A black and white negative taped to and framed by a masking sheet advertising facts about Jimmy Dickens, including his birthplace; songs recorded; albums recorded; movies, radio, and television shows he appeared on; record label; countries visited; and hobbies. Handwritten notes on the masking sheet say, "Tom run these on the stock you have (the new style)," and "150 on each." The negative would have been used to create a corresponding printing plate. The negative appears to be the first version of the fact sheet, as some information has been updated in version two.</abstract>
