  <abstract>Black and white half-length portrait of the Texas Rubies. A piece of tracing paper is taped to the photo. Notes on the tracing paper say, "65 line screen reduce 66% (height should come out to 6 inches) * we are extremely pleased with the Hemphills and Narvel Felts plates. Contract and brightness is great! Follow these as a guide for future plates."
