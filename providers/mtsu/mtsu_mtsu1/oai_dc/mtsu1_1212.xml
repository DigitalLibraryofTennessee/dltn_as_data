<dc:description>Built in 1910 and for years called the Administration Building, Kirksey Old Main was the first building on campus. Initially the building housed the administrative offices, classrooms, auditorium, gymnasium, bookstore, and the post office. Old Main underwent major renovations in 1961, 1964 and 1965. In 1978 Old Main was renamed in honor of Howard G. Kirksey, an administrator who had served in many roles over the years with the institution.</dc:description>
