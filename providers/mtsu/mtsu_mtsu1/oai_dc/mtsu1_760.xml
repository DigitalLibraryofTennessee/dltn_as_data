Editor's Note" Girls, we may have it bad -- but read this. Somehow it helps.
&lt;br&gt;
By Linda Duke
&lt;br&gt;
The great adventure of college and that first great gulp of free air -- away from watchful 
parental eyes -- was exhilarating, indeed. Rules, however, were in abundance and a 
girl had to be a pretty sharp cookie to remember them all.  Of course, there wasn't the
temptation of ever-present males, since the campus bore upon its brow only one dormitory 
-- Rutledge Hall.  Men students 
were housed a safe distance away in a two-story frame house on Woodbury Pike; the overflow 
bunked out in town.
&lt;br&gt;
But still in all, the gals had the anticipation of a weekend jaunt uptown after a hard week of classes. On good days, with a teacher up front to set the pace and one astern to discourage 
strays, the coeds were convoyed to the square for a day of shopping and letting hair down at Coin's Ice Cream Parlor. Here they could be a little gay and tell their bit of gossip -- all within earshot, of course, of the ever-present "guards." When the day (and money was spent, the convoy retraced its way back to the campus, cutting across the big cotton and cornfield (which today is a parking lot and campus school) along the fence-row path.
&lt;br&gt;
That night, if a girl were lucky enough to have a beau, she could spend an entire hour with him in the privacy(?) of the dormitory parlor.  Not only could she see him on Saturday, but Sunday as well (again, in the parlor).  On really special occasions they could even go downtown -- 
providing the occasion was a Sunday school meeting. As usual, the mode of travel was convoy.

...been amply fed only that afternoon when she picked up her lunch bag in the dining hall and 
carried it to her room, where she could eat the apple and sandwich in a more relaxed atmosphere.
&lt;br&gt;
During the week, meals were taken in the cafeteria, where everyone had his assigned seat 
(which might not be a bad idea today). After the blessing had been offered and everyone was 
seated, a few giggles might be heard from the girls as a male faculty member chose to sit on 
their side of the room. Male students were not allowed this privilege.
&lt;br&gt;
Get this: Girls were permitted to dance in the dormitory lobby on certain occasions -- with 
each other!
&lt;br&gt;
With all these frivolities it's a wonder that these sweet young things ever had a serious moment 
and really got down to studies. But I guess they did okay.
&lt;br&gt;
Does all this sound a little ...
