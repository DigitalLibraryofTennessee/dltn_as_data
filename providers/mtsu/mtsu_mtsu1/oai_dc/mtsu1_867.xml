<dc:description>Board Named To Select New Pres.
By Steve Partin
The State Board of Education picked a five 

member committee to select a successor to 

Dr. Quill
E. Cope, MTSU President. The committee is 

headed by James Jr., Mt. Pleasant banker.
The committee is authorized by State 

Commissioner of Education. It will make its 

recommendation to the board at the next 

meeting &#8212; now unscheduled.
Board of Education members serving on the 

committee include: J. Frank Taylor, 

Huntington; Dr. D.M. Spotwood, Pulaski; 

Edwin H. Kennedy, Newport; and Mrs. B. A. 

McDermott, Nashville.
President Quill E. Cope announced his 

resignation in a speeech to the faculty 

Thursday, May 9. Cope announced his 

resignation after a speech discussing 

higher education, problems of institutions 

of higher learning and the achievements 

made in the ten yearshe has served as 

president of MTSU.
Cope said that he will return to the 

University of Tennessee where he will head 

the newly established Department of 

Continuing and Higher Education and conduct 

classes on the graduate level.
"It has always been my intention to someday 

return to teaching," he said to the 11 a.m. 

meeting of the faculty and administrative 

staff.
"I now have the opportunity for a position 

in that area at the University of Tennessee 

which will be very challenging and in which 

I think I can make a contribution to higher 

education In Tennessee. It is with regret 

that I leave Middle Tennessee State 

University, its fine faculty, students, 

alumni, and friends," Cope continued.
In addition to the new position, Cope will 

be the first UT faculty member to receive 

the Clayton Arnold distinguished 

professorship in higher education.
Cope also said in his speech that as this 

or any other university grows larger, the 

problems Of diversity grow proportionately. 

He cited communication among the various 

sections of the university community as one 

of the worst problems.
"We need to develop a two-way communication 

system by which ideas can be channeled up 

when matters are involved that cannot be 

resolved at the departmental level. We need 

machinery that will assist the president, 

dean of faculty and deans of the schools in 

dealing with matters which more nearly 

reflect the consensus of the departments 

and faculty," he stated.
After briefly reviewing the situation of 

Columbia University and other schools, Cope 

said that such problems face all colleges 

and universities. He said, "Government in 

any society or community cannot prevail 

when I can decide I will only obey the laws 

I approve."
In his concluding statements, Cope said, 

"When a person serves in a position of 

leadership until he feels that another 

person with newer ideas, a different 

philosophy and a different personality 

could offer a greater challenge to those 

with whom he is associated and for the 

institution for which he is responsible, it 

is time for a change."
He ended by saying, "The Cope family has 

enjoyed and appreciated the many courtesies 

and kindnesses that those of you on the 

staff, our students, our alumni and friends 

in the community have shown us. I served 

longer here than I have ever served on any 

job since I started my teaching career in 

1932. We will always love Middle Tennessee 

State University, its people, its beauty 

and its traditions. In the words of one of 

my favorite songs, "May the good Lord bless 

and keep you."
Cope has been on leave of absence from UT 

since 1953 when became state commissioner 

of education and was extended in 1958 when 

he became president of MTSU.
J. Howard Warf, slate commissioner of 

education, said that a committee would be 

selected at the next state board of 

education meeting to recommend a successor 

to President Cope.</dc:description>
