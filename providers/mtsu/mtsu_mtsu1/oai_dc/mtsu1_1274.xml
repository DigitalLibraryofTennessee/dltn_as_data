Alumni Association At
Williamsport, Maryland
The latest Middle Tennessee State Col&#173;lege
Alumni Chapter to be organized was
in Williamsport, Maryland, on January
30. Ross Spielman (' 55), employed as
Physical Education instructor in the
Williamsport High School, was the guid&#173;ing
light in the new organization. Ross
states in his letter to the Alumni Office,
" The program for our first meeting was
very simple yet stimulating. We had
dinner at Holgates ( one of Washington's
famous seafood houses) and then a gab&#173;fest
at the home of Jack Gambill. The
next meeting has been set for April 30
at which time a more complete organiza&#173;tion
of our association will take place."
Seated. I to r- Jack Gambill, Mary WilKes
Gambill, Helen Wilson Hix, Billy Hix. Stand&#173;ing-
Ross Spielman, Hernon Fox, Loyd Luna.
He has requested two Raider football
films for showing at the next meeting,
specifying the T. P. I. and Tangerine Bowl
pictures. In attendance were the follow&#173;ing
:
Jin Ku Rhee (' 58) , student at Ameri&#173;can
University; Loyd Luna (' 55) , Lt.
U. S. . Navy ( stationed in London, Eng&#173;land);
Jack Gambill (' 56), physical edu&#173;cation
consultant; Mary Wilkes Gambill
(' 58) , also physical education consultant;
Billy Hix (' 56), Department of Defense;
Hermon Fox (' 54) , Bacteriologist; Helen
Wilson Hix, attended M. T. S. C. for two
years ( 55- 56, 56- 57); Marvin Jinnette
(' 58), U. S. Marines; Guy Norton (' 53),
Army Security Agency; Elsie Loughman,
George Mason High School.
President R. L. Jones exerted his ener&#173;gies
and thoughts during the early
months of the Normal, which opened in
1911, to sterner things such as chairs
for the classrooms, acquiring teaching
personnel, and extricating vehicles from
the quagmires that encircled the three
new buildings. During the early Spring
of 1912, he turned to the more " orna&#173;mental"
aspects of the institutional life.
The Normal needed school colors. Miss
Jeanette Moore King ( now of Fort Lau&#173;derdale,
Florida), instructor in physical
science and physiology, and Miss Tommie
Reynolds ( retired and living in Mur&#173;freesboro).

ALUMNI BANQUET
The annual Senior &#183; Alumni dinner
has been scheduled for Saturday eve&#173;ning,
May 21, at 6: 30 p. m. As usual,
a business meeting at 6: 00 p. m. will
precede the dinner. Both meetings
will be in the Union Building.
Hiram Holtsford, a Lawrenceburg
attorney, is President of the Alumni
Association and will preside at both
meetings. Homer Pittard and Presi&#173;dent
Holtsford are planning an inter&#173;esting
program which will be announc&#173;ed
in the next issue of THE MID &#183;
STATER.
All alumni are urged to reserve May
21 to revisit the campus and renew old
college friendships. Alumni may bring
guests, and all retired faculty mem&#173;bers
will be invited to attend as guests
of the association. If certain classes
would like to schedule meetings in the
morning or afternoon preceding the
banquet, please notify the Alumni Of&#173;fice
as to the desired time and a room
will be reserved. This bulletin will
carry the announcements in the next
issue.
east corner of the women's dormitory
and after prolonged discussion decided
on blue and white. Reasons given for
these choices were based on economy.
The committee pointed out in its report
to the President that blue and white
more nearly approximated the general
wearing apparel of the early Normal
students, and " school affiliation and
spirit could be displayed in a more
economical and practical manner." The
committee further stated that school col&#173;ors
embodied in every- day apparel could
be purchased across the counter in any
general merchandise store. The 1913
football team carried the first blue and
white motif.
Two years prior to World War I, the
Normal's athletic activities began to ap&#173;pear
in the press under the aegis of
' Pedagogues'. This
nickname, applied
by some unknown
sports writer, be&#173;came
the designa&#173;tion
on the sports
pages until 1934
although it was not
generally accepted
by the students.
Besides the diffi&#173;culty
inherent in
the spelling, the
sideline roo t e r s
had very little
taste for wrap-ping
a yell or a fight song around a
cumbersome punch word like " Peda&#173;gogues".
They more or less contented
themselves with " Mid- State, Mid- State,
and " Teachers" and " Old Normal" until
the News Journal stepped into the pic&#173;ture
in 1934. In that year, this local
newspaper conducted a contest to choose
a more appealing name. Over 240 en&#173;tries
were submitted. Final choice was

Parson Tricked On Possum
Hunt, But Wrote Alma Mater
Miss E. May Saunders was a member of the first faculty when the Middle
Tennessee State Normal School opened on September 11, 1911. She remained with
this inst itu tion for forty- four years, served under three Presidents and saw it
change from a two &#183; year normal to a four- year teacher's college and finally to a
state college with a graduate program. To the hundreds of students who sat in
her music classes, sang in her chorus, or drew a bow in her orchestra, she was
" Miss Music." One of the present music organizations, the Saunderian Club, is
named in her honor. When asked to write a few reminiscences about her college
teaching days, she readily complied and the following is the result. She has
agreed to continue in a later issue of the MID- STATER.
O. L. Freeman Invited To
President's Conference
On Occupational Safety
Another honor has come to O. L. " Noo&#173;by"
Freeman, Alumnus of M. T. S. C. ( class
of 1928) and Industrial Arts faculty
member since 1934. He has been invited
by President Dwight D. Eisenhower to at&#173;tend
the President's Conference on Oc&#173;cupational
Safety. The membership will
convene at Constitution Hall. The pur&#173;pose
of the Conference is to devise
means to reduce disabling and fatal ac&#173;cidents.
Among the speakers are Presi&#173;dent
Eisenhower, Secretary of Labor,
James Mitchell, and Commissioner of Ed&#173;ucation,
Laurence Derthick.
If Certain People Will
Keep Working You Can
Expect Another Issue
Indicated by the many favorable
comments received from the alumni, the
first issue of the Mid &#183; Stater was a suc&#173;cessful
venture. One more issue will be
mailed to you near the close of the sec&#173;ond
semester. The Fall edition will
contain eight pages and possibly a pic&#173;ture
section devoted to new buildings
and campus activities. The mast- head
was designed by Howard Hull, an art ma&#173;jor
presently enrolled at the College. E.
O. Hawkins and Gene Sloan regularly
contribute articles on sports and special
features. Bob Womack suggested the
name for the bulletin.
Economy Dictated
( Continued From Page 1)
left to the football team and " Blue
Raiders" appeared to be the most ap&#173;propriate.
Charles Sarver, a guard on
the team and presently Superintendent
of Lincoln County schools, suggested the
winning nickname. Charles borrowed
" Raiders" from the " Red Raiders" of
Colgate and the " Blue" is obvious.
Bedford Forrest, intrepid Confederate
cavalry leader, crept into the symbol
during the first years of President Q. M.
Smith's administration. To President
Smith, " the First with the Most" repre&#173;sented
or should represent the spirit of
the team and the remainder of the col&#173;lege.
Consequently, Gene Sloan, pub&#173;licity
director incorporated this idea in
stories released from his office. At the
present time, a representation of For&#173;rest
astride " King Philip" appears on
decals, the Sidelines, bookstore supplies,
and promotional literature. The new
ROTC building is designated as Forest
Hall. One cannot help thinking that
" That Devil" must turn over, at least
once or twice, each time " blue" is af&#173;fixed
across his symbol.
By MISS E. MAY SAUNDERS
If we could look back through the
years, we could see four buildings on the
campus of MTN- the Administration
Building, the dining hall, the dormitories
for the girls and the President's home.
The boy's dormitory was over on the
pike, but you could set your watch by
the regularity of their trips across the
field to the dining hall.
The growth of our school from 1911 to
1918 was most encouraging in every way.
A: good road to the campus entrance was
soon made, but I wonder if you remem&#173;ber
the time the laundry wagon at&#173;tempted
a short cut across the campus
after a very hard rain, and the horse
was drowned in what the students called
" Lake Unnecessary."
It was never an unusual thing to walk
across the field to the Woodbury Pike
when the heavy rains flooded our new
road, but the old cinder path, so well
known by the young hopefuls, was al&#173;ways
ready. A young minister, J. D. Mc&#173;Connell,
a Sewanee student, came to
Murfreesboro as an assistant to Episco&#173;pal
minister. He became a member of
our student body, as well as a member
of the men's chorus and the glee club. I
do not think his interest was solely that
of music, for in this group were some
very attractive Southern girls.
In the fall a possum hunt was the usu&#173;al
activity on Friday nights- I think the
boys were anxious for Parson to know
something about this sort of a hunt, but
on this particular night I felt that there
was something other than the usual
procedure. Everything was set so that
after we had cooked our lunch some of
the fellows said they would take the dog
and see if any possums were near. Par &#183;
son stayed with his very good friends,
and it wasn't long until the dogs began
to bark as if the possum was treed. Ex&#173;-
citement reigned supreme, but instead of
a possum they found that little fellow
which is all white with that black stripe
- from head to tail. Parson was more
excited than the rest but the tragedy
was that he went a little too close. You
3
know the rest- but he was quick to for&#173;give
and the fun was shared by all- but
boys will be boys- What say you? Before
Mr. McConnell left our school he wrote
our Alma Mater-" Hail M. T. N. All Hail. "
In 1918 he left for one of the southern
camps where he was made chaplain.
During the first seven years the first
student organizations were attempted.
The result was literary societies which
served the -' purpose of developing crea&#173;tive
ability as well as aiding in social ac&#173;tivities
. The societies organized by the
girls were the Dromgoole and Mary Mur&#173;free
- names chosen in honor of Miss
Will Allen Dromgoole and Miss Mary
Murfree, writers who lived in Murfrees&#173;boro.
Rooms on the third floor of the
Administration Building were used as a
meeting place. Club spirit and loyalty
quickly developed.
The societies organized by the boys
were given the names of Grady and
Claxton. These two societies in their de&#173;bates
created strong school spirit which
in later years resulted in the inter- col&#173;legiate
debates.
Spring Sports Interest High
With basketball and spring football
over, the coaching staff is turning its at&#173;tention
to spring sports: baseball, track,
tennis, and golf. Middle Tennessee has
found renewed interest for the last few
years in three minor sports.
Coach Buck Rolman piloted a fresh&#173;man-
studded nine to a three- way tie for
the OVC championship in 1959, and he
has most of that crew returning this
year for an eighteen game slate which
begins March 26 with Vanderbilt. Chief
among the returnees are two pitchers,
John Stanford and Jerry Stapleton. Stan&#173;ford,
a righthander, curved his way to a
7- 1 record in 1959 and is expected to be
the staff ace again. Stapleton, a lefty who
is better known as a football end, came
through with several important wins last
year.
Five other lettermen include a com&#173;plete
outfield plus second and third
basemen. Main losses include: home run
leader Dave Hall, who signed with the
Boston Red Sox for a sizeable bonus; Bob
Bennett, .385 hitting shortstop; and
sparkplug catcher Virgil King. Bennett
and King did not return to school this
term. Rolman expects several promising
freshmen to fill in the gaps.
Joe Black Hayes is enthusiastic about
his track team, although the principal
pointmakers, Ed Carson and James
Frost, have gone via graduation. An un&#173;usually
large number of talented fresh-
1I0utstandingil Alumni
Will Be Selected In
March; 35 Nominated
The response to the plan to recognize
three outstanding alumni in a special
ceremony at the annual Alumni Ban&#173;quet
has been excellent. Some thirty&#173;five
distinguished men and women
have been nominated. The commit&#173;tee
appointed by President Hiram
Holtsford will meet early in March to
make the selection from the nomin&#173;ees.
Selections are being made at this
early date so that the honorees may
be featured in the MIDLANDER. Since
our alumni have been significantly
successful in so many walks of life, it
is obvious that no attempt will be
made to pick the number ONE,
TWO and THREE among our some
six thousand graduates. The commit&#173;tee
selections will be determined en &#183;
tirely by the interest and responses
indicated by the written nominations.
_' men are responsible for the Hayes smile.
More than thirty- five candidates have
been working out on their own since
midwinter. Hayes is counting on proven
winners Ray Purvis in the sprints, hurd&#173;ler
Dick Swain, high jumper Troy Hay&#173;den,
and miler Don Casey among the
lettermen. Other potential point- getters
are &#183; Porter Maxwell, a transfer who may
well be the best distance runner ever to
perform at MTSC, and Gene Watson, a
weight man. Many other candidates were
high school champions, and the depth
that was lacking last year seems to be at
Hayes' service in 1960.
The tennis squad appears stronger
than it has in years. Only three letter&#173;men
failed to return, but several new
faces may push the monogram wearers to
the bench. Andre Duhaime and Hester
Gibbs, numbers two and four respective&#173;ly
last year, are back along with reserves
Jerry Franklin and Bill Harvey. Transfer
Worthy Babb and ex- footballer Whit
Watson will push Duhaime for the top
spot, and a host of freshmen candidates
led by Leon Pruitt, a regular at Colum&#173;bia
Military Academy last year, are battl&#173;ing
for rungs on the ladder. But the sur&#173;prise
package might well be winsome
Bonnie Hudgens, second ranked woman
player in Tennessee, who hopes to emu&#173;late
women's state champ Marilyn Voges,
who competes with great success against
men at Chattanooga.
Coach Elbert Patty can hardly hope
to improve much over last year's golf
record. In 1959 the Raiderlinksmen had
a 9- 1 dual record, were TIAC champs,
and finished a close second in the OVC.
But Patty has the wherewithal to take
the whole package in 1960, for he lost
only one man and has five excellent golf&#173;ers
battling for the vacant spot. Return&#173;ing
are regulars Doug Hall, Joel Vinson,
and David Dixon, plus reserve letterman
Farrell Walters. Two seniors, Richard
Wagster and John Moore, and two fresh&#173;men,
Grady Head and Randall Woodard,
are all capable of subpar golf, and the
regulars will have to be very sharp to
hold their positions.
Highlight of the spring program will
be the OVC track meet and tennis tour&#173;nament
at Murfreesboro the weekend of
May 20- 21. Local fans will have a chance
to see the best of two states in these
meets.

Historical Documents
And Pictures Needed
For 50th Anniversary
By 1961, Middle Tennessee State
College will have reached the some&#173;what
mature age of fifty years. One
of the commemorative activities of the
Golden Anniversary year will be the
publication of the history of the col &#183;
lege. Pictures and documents, particu&#173;larly
of the early years, are needed.
These should be mailed to the Alumni
Office where they will be copied, care&#173;fully
packed, and returned. Reminis&#173;cences,
unique incidents, and stories
not generally known about the life of
the college ( that can be printed) will
add greatly to interest in the publica&#173;tion.
These should be mailed to the
Alumni Office also.
