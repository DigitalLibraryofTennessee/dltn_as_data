<dc:description>The Murfree Building stood on the present-day site of Peck Hall. This was the first building constructed on campus to serve as a library, replacing room 69 of Kirksey Old Main. The building opened in the 1926-27 academic year but was not dedicated as the Bettie Avent Murfree Building until 1958, after the death of Mrs. Murfree. At the same ceremony its larger and more modern successor was dedicated as the Todd Library Building. Bettie Avent Murfree managed the library from the school's opening in 1911 until her retirement in 1945. The Murfree Building stood until construction of Peck Hall began in the mid-1960s.</dc:description>
