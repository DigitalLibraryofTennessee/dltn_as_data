Phi Epsilon Was First MTSU Chartered Frat
Phi Epsilon was organized on Nov. 11, 1961. Granted a state charter Sept. 28, 1963, they were recognized as the first social fraternity on the MTSU campus in the fall of 1966.
President of the organization is David Kious with Stan Hardison serving as vice president.	
During their six-year existence, Phi Ep has worked closely with the ASB and the Administration in conducting campus clean-ups, selling tickets for ASB activities, and supporting all athletic activities.
In the past year, members have been ushers at the ASB Big Name Entertainment Shows and have sponsored a child from the Good 

Shepherd's Children Home. They have also participated in many varied civic and charity projects in Rutherford County.
Over the past years Phi Epsilon has supported the Baptist Orphange in Franklin County, won the Civitan Club candy sale for the past three years, donated more money to the Cerebal Palsy Drive in 1966 than any other Rutherford County organization, worked for the Heart Fund Roadblock from 1961-1966, given baskets for the needy to the Rutherford County Welfare Department, and worked at the Good Shepherd's Children Home on occasions.
Recently Phi Epsilon was presented a trophy at the National Jaycee Convention for selling the most tickets for the Grantland Rice Bowl. 
Phi Epsilon placed third in the 1967 Homecoming Parade. They were the only fraternity to place in this competition.
