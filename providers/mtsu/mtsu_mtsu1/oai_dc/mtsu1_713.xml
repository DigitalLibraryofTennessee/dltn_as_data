<dc:description>A baseball game with spectators in the bleachers and spectators sitting around the concession area--and some seeking refuge from the sun under a tree. The dairy farm is in the background.</dc:description>
<dc:description>During [part of] the WWII years, there was no baseball team, but the campus was full of cadets in training. MTSU had its first full-time baseball coach in 1971; prior to that, coaching baseball was a part-time responsibility for assistant basketball coaches. The addition of field lighting in 1981 allowed MTSU to host night games and improve recruiting.</dc:description>
