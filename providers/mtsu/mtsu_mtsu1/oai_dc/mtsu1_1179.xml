<dc:description>Claxton Literary Society was one of the earliest organizations on campus. Reportedly the organization was named for a local writer, and the group went on social outings together.</dc:description>
<dc:description>&#8220;It is evident to all great thinking people that in order for a young man to feel perfectly at ease among his fellow men, he must be a ready conversationalist; a debater on the great issues of the day, a ready reader, and able to be a just critic of others' doings&#8221; (Middle Tennessee Normal Signal, 1912). The Claxton Literary Society, a debating and public speaking society, was formed at the beginning of the second quarter of the school year of 1911-12.</dc:description>
