<dc:description>A class photo at the Middle Tennessee State Teachers College Campus School</dc:description>
<dc:description>The School has had many names--Demonstration School, Training School, and Campus School. In 1985, the name officially became Homer Pittard Campus School in honor of Homer Pittard, a Rutherford County educator who had served as principal at McFadden School and Central High School and as Director of University Affairs at MTSU. The original purpose of the Campus School was to serve as a teaching laboratory for aspiring teachers. Prospective teachers meet children in real situations in an effort to give the children and the college students the best and latest in content and procedure. Campus School endeavors to make its classrooms, its various activities, and its daily routine as real-world as possible.</dc:description>
