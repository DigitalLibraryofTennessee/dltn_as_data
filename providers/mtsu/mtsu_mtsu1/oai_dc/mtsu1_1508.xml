<dc:description>The library from the 1952 Midlander yearbook</dc:description>
<dc:description>The first library at the institution was housed in the Administration Building. Bettie Avent Murfree was employed as the first librarian in 1912. The first library building opened in the fall of 1926, and in 1957 the building was named for Bettie Avent Murfree to show appreciation for her significant contributions to the institution. The Andrew L. Todd Memorial Library, named in honor of a local businessman who was instrumental in the founding of the institution, was dedicated in 1958. The current library, the James E. Walker Library opened in 1999.</dc:description>
