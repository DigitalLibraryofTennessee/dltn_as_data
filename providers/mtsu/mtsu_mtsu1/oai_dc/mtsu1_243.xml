<dc:description>11th College Training Detachment departing for Classification Center, N.A.A.C., Nashville</dc:description>
<dc:description>College Training Detachments instituted during World War II consisted of cadets who qualified for flight training with the Army Air Corps. Prior to entering more specialized flight programs, the cadets received five months of academic and military instruction at colleges throughout the nation. The cadets, in military uniform, marched in formation to and from their classes. Their military training consisted of the customs, courtesies and regulations of the service, as well as military drills and discipline. In addition, each cadet received approximately ten hours of dual instruction in light airplanes, during which he learned elementary flight maneuvers, landing and traffic procedure. The cadets received instruction in mathematics, physics, history, geography, and English from the instructors at the participating institutions.</dc:description>
