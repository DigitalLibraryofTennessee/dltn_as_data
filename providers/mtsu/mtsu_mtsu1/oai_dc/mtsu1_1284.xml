Vol. 2- No . 3 Murfreesboro, Tennessee Winter Issu e, 196 1
Middle Tennessee State College will
r eceive $ 2,684,000 during the next bien&#173;nium
plus a minimum of $ 500,000 for
capital outlay based on the recommenda&#173;of
Governor Buford Ellington to
the Tennessee Gener al Assembly.
The amount included in the Governor's
budget provides for $ 1,228,000 for 1961&#173;62
and an increase to $ 1,456,000 for the
1962- 63 period. The amount set up fo r
next year is contingent on the collegp
rea ching an equated enrollment of 3,031
students in the fall semester this year.
The governor's budget also includes
$ 7,200,000 bond issue for capital out &#183;
lay. MTSC has $ 500,000 ea rmarked
from t his fund. This will likely go
towards the e rection of two new wings
to Lyon Hall and the const ruction of
a new Home Economics Building to
free the second floor of the Scie nce
Building for badly needed classroom
space for the sc iences.
The current budget of MTSC for the
year ending June 30, 1961 is $ 1,070,000.
In keeping with his proposed budget
Dr. Quill E. Cope has a plan tailored to
fit this risi~ tide of enrollment. This
plan includes new plant facilities plus an
enlarged fac ulty, emphasis on a strong
curriculum and high academic achieve&#173;ment.
The overall plan called for an out&#173;lay
of $ 7,900,000 as originally projected
by President Emeritus Q. M. Smith, in
capital funds over a period of 13 years&#173;from
1957 to 1970. One phase of the
aggr egating $ 1,677,000 has been realized.
The second phase was earmarked at
$ 2,000,000 and was to include a new
Agriculture Building, Home Ec. Build&#173;ing,
new infirmary and conversion of
two other build ings. Increased en roll &#183;
ment has caused President Cope and
his faculty advisers to reconsider the
second phase.

the areas of Biology, Chemistry, Mathe&#173;matics
and Physics. It is so designed that
a participant will spend a greater portion
of his t ime in disciplines of a supporting
nature outside his academic major area,
and a lesser portion of his time in ad&#173;vanced
work within his academic major
area. Many teachers of mathematics and
science are now operating in the " fringe"
area of their subject matter knowledge.
The Institute should aid the teacher in
doing a creditable job in the area of his
specialty and an acceptable job in certain
other areas of teaching assignments.
This is the third consecutive summer
for an institute at M. T. S. C. The program
is of a sequential nature such that par&#173;ticipants
may complete all work for the
Masters degree in three summer Insti&#173;tutes
.
INSTITUTE IS BOON TO MATH
AND SCIENCE TEACHERS
Dr. Cope: A Busy Man With a Complex Job
Middle Tennessee State College has re&#173;ceived
a grant of $ 100,700 from the Na&#173;tional
Science Foundation for an eleven
week Institute for Secondary School sci&#173;ence
and mathematics teachers for the
summer of 1961. The Institute will begin
June 5 and terminate August 18. Stipends
of $ 75 per week and dependency allow&#173;ances
up to $ 15 per week for each de&#173;pendent
will be awarded to approximate&#173;ly
60 secondary science and mathematics
teachers.
Dr. J. Eldred Wiser, (' 36) , head of the
Chemistry and Physics Department, will
be the director of the institute. The In&#173;stitute
staff will be composed, for the
most part, of regular M. T. S. C. staff mem&#173;bers.
Guest lecturers will contribute ma&#173;terially
to the program.
The Institute at M. T. S. C. covers work in
New $$, New Buildings, 5,000 Students

SCHOOL'S LARGEST
Grads Send Children To Alma Mater
One evidence that Middle Tennessee State College alumni are happy and sat-isfied
customers is the large representation of their children on the campus today.
A quick survey of second generation Raiders and Raiderettes now in the educational
throes resulted in the imposing list below. Since this information is not requested
on any form for application or registration, the survey was dependent on student
response. If there are others, please send data to the Alumni office.

William Maggart (' 51) was recently
honored by twenty schools in Madison,
Tennessee, as the choice for the award
of Outstanding Male Teacher of 1960- 6l.
William spent two years in the Service,
taught at Westmoreland before coming
to Stratton School in Davidson County.
He is remembered at M. T. S. C. for his
outstanding activities in music, particu&#173;larly
as a member of the Sacred Harp
Singers and as having a lead in the first
WILLIAM MAGGART
opera produced at the college. During the
Christmas holidays he was married to
Ann Weidrich, a senior and also a music
major at M. T. S. C.
FIRST FACULTY PHOTO
In June 1911, the first official Bull et in
of the Middle Tennessee State Normal
School listed the following faculty mem&#173;bers
: R. L. J ones, H. H. Clark, Archibald
Bel cher, W. N. Bill ingsley, P. A. Lyon,
Max Souby, Cl a rk Woodward, Eugene
Tavenner, Logan S. Gilln stine, Robert
White, Mary Arthur, Margaret Webber,
Kathe rine Monohan, W e e s i e Gr iffith,
Tommie Reynolds, and Jeannette Moore
King. It is possible that a composite
picture was made of t his group at some
time during the first year, but a diligent
search has failed to unearth one. The
Alumni Office would appreciate the loan
of a picture of this group. This is al&#173;most
a " must" as the Semi- Centennial
year is approached .
Pictures for this issues of the MID &#183;
STATER were made by Dr. Bealer
Smotherman (' 34), D ire c tor of the
M. T. S. C. Audio Visual Department.

February 15 has been set as the deadline for submitting nominations for
Outstanding Alumni awards for 1961. Again, three will be chosen from the
some six thousand alumni scattered over the globe. Alumni Association Presi&#173;dent
Charles Parker Parsons (' 30), of Kirkman Technical High School in
Chattanooga, Tennessee, has already appointed a committee to review the
nominations. Those made last year are on file and will be considered again
with those received this year. Honorees will be recognized in special cere&#173;monies
at the Alumni Banquet in May.

The home of Allie Gray Smith ' 59) and
Gladys Cole Smith (' 58) Smith was the
scene of a meeting on December 10, 1960,
of a group of the alumni in the Miami
area. Gladys writes that " we had a very
enjoyable evening eating fruit cake and
drinking coffee. Colored slides of M. T. &#173;S.
C. were shown, and a few oldtimers
were flabbergasted at the changes. Many
of our friends have seen these slides and
think M. T. S. C. is certainly as lovely as
we say it is." Another meeting of those
in the entire area will be held in March.

In 1956, the college went over 2000
students for the first time in its history.
In 1957, there were 2245 enrolled ; in
1958, enrollment climbed to 2534, drop &#183;
ped to 2371 in 1959, then " exploded" to
2855 in the 1960 fall semester. This was
a gain of nearly ' 500 in one year and a
net gain of about 800 in the past four
years.
Middle Tennessee State head football
coach Charles " Bubba" Murphy has an&#173;nounced
that five Tennessee high ~ chool
gridders have signed football scholar&#173;ships
with MTSC.
Latest to sign with the Raiders is
Teddy Morris, a Murfreesboro Central
tailback. Murphy indicated that he plalis
to use Morris, a good runner and passer,
as a halfback in the Raider split " T'
attack.
Two Sevierville grid del's to ink Raidcl&#173;pacts
are Keith Atchley and Robert
AJlen. Atchley, a 5' 11", 195 lb. guard ,
was an All- Conference performer with
Sevierville last season, and was chosen
on the 3rd team All- State squad. Allen
is a 6' 2V2", 185 lb. quarterback.
Both boys are products of former
MTSC Little All- American f u I I b a c k
Terry Sweeney, head coach at Sevier&#173;ville.
Players to sign earlier with the Blue
Raiders were halfback Tom Curley and
quarterback Jam e s " Boots" Donnelly,
both from Nashville's Father Ryan. Cur&#173;ley
was a third team choice on the All&#173;Nashville
squad, while Donnelly, a top&#173;notch
passer, was a first team All- Nash&#173;ville
selection.
Murphy also released his schedule for
the 1961 season , which has nine of last
Earlier projections showed the college
vlould have about 3500 students on the
campus by 1965. That number is now
expected to be enrolled in 1963. If other
projections are realized, by 1970 there
will be 5000 students on the campus.

A determined Raider squad entered the
Gulf South Classic at Shreveport, La. and

Louisiana.
Ole Mississippi met MTSC in the
championship semi- finals and gave the
Raiders a 64- 62 defeat with the victory
goal being scored in the final 2 seconds
on the game . . . the second time of the
young season that MTSC had to leave the
floor without a chance to retaliate.
The battle for third place in the 8- team
tournament matched the Raiders with the
host Centenary cagers. The Raiders knot&#173;ted
the score 61- 61 to gain an overtime,
but was outscored 15- 6 in the extra per&#173;iod.
Murray State invaded Murfreesboro af&#173;ter
the Christmas holidays and blasted
the Raiders 97- 58 for MTSC's third con&#173;ference
loss. MTSC journeyed to Johnson
City to gain their first OVC win of the
season with a 100- 90 upset of East Ten&#173;nessee.
David Lipscomb put the Raiders in
their third overtime game of the season,
and gained a 68- 66 decision at Nashville.
MTSC found further road trouble at East&#173;ern
Kentucky after staying with the Ma&#173;roons
for 20 minutes, but dropped a 90&#173;63
decision to the tough Kentuckians.
With ten games remaining, Coach Ed
is hoping for a better break with Dame

pended count doubly if possible and our
studies are aimed at utilizing every inch
of space available plus building our fa&#173;culty
and curriculum," President Cope
said.
" This restudy of the second phase of
the overall plan was necessitated by
increased enrollment. We are now about
three years ahead of the projected num&#173;ber
of students who were expected to
be on the campus," he added.
An indication of this increase can be
seen in the number of students enrolled
in the fall quarter.
Bob Burden
Senior forward Bob Burden continues
to pace the M. T. S. C. scoring attack with
218 points in 13 games, averaging 16.8
per contest.
Bobby Tillman May Stay
In Boston This Year
Bobby Tillman, who attended Middle
Tennessee State College in 1956- 57, is
slated to report to the Red Sox this
spring. George Digby, Boston Red Sox
scout, had this to say: " 1 wouldn't be at
all surprised if he sticks. He hit twenty&#173;four
home runs for Minneapolis last sea&#173;son.
1 expect to see him hit more home
runs than any Red Sox catcher in his&#173;tory,
maybe not next season, but before
he hangs up his spikes. He's a natural
if 1 ever saw one."
While at M. T. S. C., Bobby was under&#173;study
to quarterback Bob Hallum and
an outstanding diamond performer.
Coach Ed Diddle Jr.' s basketball squad
heads down the 1960- 61 season home
stretch with a creditable showing against
some of the South's top squads. The Raid&#173;ers
are riding a 5- 8 season into their
January 23rd game with Austin Peay
State.
There have been only 3 games this sea&#173;son
that the Raiders have failed to hold
their own; otherwise, with a little luck,
Diddle's Raiders could be holding a 10- 3
record for the 1960- 61 season.
MTSC opened the season with a 67- 70
loss to tough Western Kentucky, out&#173;14
points, but hit only 13 of 25 from the
foul line. Western, meanwhile, hit on 30
of 37 charity tosses.
The Raiders bounced back with a 66- 54
win over Nicholls State ( La.), and gain&#173;ed
their second win with a 69- 56 pound&#173;ing
of Stetson University.
Lady Luck again turned her back on
the Raiders while Southwestern Louisi&#173;ana
University tossed in a last second
