<dc:description>Jiu-jutsu demonstration with E.R. Riley and Passanisi at the War Bond Rally in Murfreesboro. During WWII, Murfreesboro was the sight of both training of troops and widespread support of the war effort. In addition to the army units that were training in the area, there was the College Training Detachment. During a War Bond Rally on the Square on August 18, 1943, the College Training Detachment hosted demonstrations and speeches for the entertainment of the assembled crowd. A note on the back of the photo says: "See: Skylines Newspaper, October 2, page 1, column 5, 'A/S take part in Bond Day Exhibition'"</dc:description>
