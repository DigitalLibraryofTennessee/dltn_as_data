<dc:description>The Buchanan Players was a campus organization that provided a workshop environment for students in the theater arts. They performed new plays and also produced and directed their own plays to obtain parts not available in main stage productions. The purpose of the club was to train students in dramatic production and to prepare members for the national dramatic fraternity, Alpha Psi Omega.</dc:description>
