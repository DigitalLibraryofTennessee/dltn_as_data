  <abstract>Thomas A. Dorsey (1899-1993), started his career as "Georgia Tom" a singer of bawdy blues songs. In the early 1930s he left the blues and jazz behind to become one of the most important authors of gospel songs. Dorsey composed familiar pieces such as "Peace in the Valley" and "Precious Lord, Take My Hand."</abstract>

    <abstract>Tennessee’s history between the end of the American Civil War (1865) and the end of World War II (1945) often gets ignored. Citizenship—what that has meant and how that has changed—is at the heart of this digital exploration into Tennessee history and culture “between the wars." The stories you can explore through the objects, songs, photographs, paintings, and documents of this website are often those of challenges and obstacles placed before those who pursued the rights and benefits of citizenship.</abstract>
