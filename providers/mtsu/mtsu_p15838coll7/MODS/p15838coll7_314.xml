  <abstract>Noting that "scores and scores of people had declared openly that a negro Bank of Nashville was a matter of impossibility," this advertisement praises the bank for its steady growth and service to its customers. A large insert includes portraits of the officers and directors of the bank.</abstract>

    <abstract>Tennessee’s history between the end of the American Civil War (1865) and the end of World War II (1945) often gets ignored. Citizenship—what that has meant and how that has changed—is at the heart of this digital exploration into Tennessee history and culture “between the wars." The stories you can explore through the objects, songs, photographs, paintings, and documents of this website are often those of challenges and obstacles placed before those who pursued the rights and benefits of citizenship.</abstract>
