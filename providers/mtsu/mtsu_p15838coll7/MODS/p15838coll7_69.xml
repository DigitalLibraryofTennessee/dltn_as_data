  <abstract>This photograph of a man and a woman seated side by side in front of a white frame building is matted in light brown surrounded by a white spacer and a carved green frame. A figure standing behind them is obscured by the way the image has been divided by two openings in the mat. The bearded man seated at left is smiling, wearing a white shirt, bow tie, and dark suit and holding an open bible in both hands. The woman seated at right with her hands in her lap, has broad high cheekbones and a solemn expression. She wears a light colored hood and scarf, a dark dress, and a white apron.</abstract>

    <abstract>Tennessee’s history between the end of the American Civil War (1865) and the end of World War II (1945) often gets ignored. Citizenship—what that has meant and how that has changed—is at the heart of this digital exploration into Tennessee history and culture “between the wars." The stories you can explore through the objects, songs, photographs, paintings, and documents of this website are often those of challenges and obstacles placed before those who pursued the rights and benefits of citizenship.</abstract>
