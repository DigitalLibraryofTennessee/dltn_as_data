  <abstract>The Del Morocco, owned by Theodore Acklen, thrived on Nashville's Jefferson Street from the 1940s to the late 1960s, and many music greats are rumored to have played there, including Jimi Hendrix, Duke Ellington, and Little Richard. Interstate 40, which cut down Jefferson Street, led to the demolishment of Club Del Morocco, Club Baron, Maceo's, and other prominent African American music clubs.</abstract>

    <abstract>Tennessee’s history between the end of the American Civil War (1865) and the end of World War II (1945) often gets ignored. Citizenship—what that has meant and how that has changed—is at the heart of this digital exploration into Tennessee history and culture “between the wars." The stories you can explore through the objects, songs, photographs, paintings, and documents of this website are often those of challenges and obstacles placed before those who pursued the rights and benefits of citizenship.</abstract>
