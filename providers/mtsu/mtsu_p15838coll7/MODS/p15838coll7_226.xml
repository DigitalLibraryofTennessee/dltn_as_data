  <abstract>This image was scanned from an 18 x 12 inch poster reproducing a quilt in the collection of the Tennessee Valley Authority. The text under the image is as follows: ''Uncle Sam's Helping Hand' This quilt was one of several made by African American women whose husbands worked on Wheeler Dam in Alabama in the 1930's. Many of these quilts conveyed appreciation for the improved living standard TVA brought to the region. 'Uncle Sam's Helping Hand' is on permanent display in TVA's Historical Collection in Knoxville, Tennessee."</abstract>

    <abstract>Tennessee’s history between the end of the American Civil War (1865) and the end of World War II (1945) often gets ignored. Citizenship—what that has meant and how that has changed—is at the heart of this digital exploration into Tennessee history and culture “between the wars." The stories you can explore through the objects, songs, photographs, paintings, and documents of this website are often those of challenges and obstacles placed before those who pursued the rights and benefits of citizenship.</abstract>
