  <abstract>This ad, published in the Murfreesboro Union in 1933, is for H. Preston Scales. Preston Scales established his funeral home in Murfreesboro in 1916, and the funeral home is still in business. Mr. Scales also established the Helping Hand Mutual Burial Association, an association that provided each deceased member with a funeral benefit. Mr. Scales died in 1946. The ad was published in the Murfreesboro Union, an African American newspaper in Murfreesboro, published by Mary Ellen Vaughn from 1920-c. 1950.</abstract>

    <abstract>Tennessee’s history between the end of the American Civil War (1865) and the end of World War II (1945) often gets ignored. Citizenship—what that has meant and how that has changed—is at the heart of this digital exploration into Tennessee history and culture “between the wars." The stories you can explore through the objects, songs, photographs, paintings, and documents of this website are often those of challenges and obstacles placed before those who pursued the rights and benefits of citizenship.</abstract>
