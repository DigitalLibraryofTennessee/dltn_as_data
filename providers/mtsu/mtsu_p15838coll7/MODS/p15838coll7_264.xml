  <abstract>Interior of a drug store with soda fountain at front right and glass cased pharmacy counter at left. Four persons are inside the store. A boy sits on a chair at back left and a man in a three-piece suit stands in front of him next to the glass cases. Seated on one of several wooden stools with cane seats at the soda fountain counter is a man in bowler hat, while a uniformed attendant leans on one elbow behind the counter. Electric light fixtures hang from the ceiling and the back wall has a wallpaper patterned border at top.</abstract>

    <abstract>Tennessee’s history between the end of the American Civil War (1865) and the end of World War II (1945) often gets ignored. Citizenship—what that has meant and how that has changed—is at the heart of this digital exploration into Tennessee history and culture “between the wars." The stories you can explore through the objects, songs, photographs, paintings, and documents of this website are often those of challenges and obstacles placed before those who pursued the rights and benefits of citizenship.</abstract>
