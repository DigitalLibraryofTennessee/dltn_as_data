  <abstract>African American workmen inside a large wooden truss structure, with clerestory windows and back windows providing light. Some are shown with two wheeled carts laden with stacks of parts, others are standing on either side of a long worktable with tools, or stacking and moving parts. A slender white man wearing a short collarless jacket and flat cap stands at center with his hands behind his back. Written on the photograph at lower center is "American Breake (sic) Shoe F'd'y" and "Stokes" at lower right.</abstract>

    <abstract>Tennessee’s history between the end of the American Civil War (1865) and the end of World War II (1945) often gets ignored. Citizenship—what that has meant and how that has changed—is at the heart of this digital exploration into Tennessee history and culture “between the wars." The stories you can explore through the objects, songs, photographs, paintings, and documents of this website are often those of challenges and obstacles placed before those who pursued the rights and benefits of citizenship.</abstract>
