  <abstract>Two-story brick building with triple stone arched entry, steep pitched roof with two front gable dormers, side gable dormer also visible on left side, and center steeple with gothic cupola. A low stone wall marks the boundary of the property and utility poles and wires are visible in front of the building. Photograph shows small bare trees out front, and a low modern-looking horizontal structure behind, with a square brick smokestack behind it. Written at lower left on the photograph "Main Street Colored School" and at lower right "Stokes." David Stokes opened his photography studio, located on Market Street, in 1881. He became known for his visual documentation of landscapes, downtown buildings, battlegrounds, and his work with the railroad. His son, William Henry Stokes, learned the craft in his father’s studio and shared many commercial assignments in downtown Chattanooga. W.H. Stokes would later open his own studio in East Lake around 1901. Many historic photographs of Chattanooga bear the Stokes name.</abstract>

    <abstract>Tennessee’s history between the end of the American Civil War (1865) and the end of World War II (1945) often gets ignored. Citizenship—what that has meant and how that has changed—is at the heart of this digital exploration into Tennessee history and culture “between the wars." The stories you can explore through the objects, songs, photographs, paintings, and documents of this website are often those of challenges and obstacles placed before those who pursued the rights and benefits of citizenship.</abstract>
