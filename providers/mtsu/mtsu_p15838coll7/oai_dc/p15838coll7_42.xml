<dc:description>The first CME (Christian Methodist Episcopal, formerly Colored Methodist Episcopal) was Capers Memorial CME Church in Nashville, organized in 1866.   In 1870, leaders from Capers and other African American Methodists in West Tennessee broke away from the Methodist Episcopal Church, South and created a new denomination, the CME church.   The CME church was especially popular in West Tennessee, and was headquartered in Jackson, Tennessee until 1970, when the headquarters moved to Memphis.  The CME Church has more than a million members.</dc:description>
