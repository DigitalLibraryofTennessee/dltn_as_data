<dc:description>In the early decades of the twentieth century, the State of Tennessee created several "state training schools" or reform schools for teenaged offenders.  The school for "negro boys" was located near Pikeville on the Cumberland Plateau. Conditions there came to public attention after a violent series of events in 1944 that included the apparent murder of the wife and daughter of superintendent H.E. Scott and the "lynching" of the teenager suspected of killing the two. After revelations that the facilities were inadequate, overcrowded, and unsanitary, modern fire-proof buildings were constructed in 1945.</dc:description>
