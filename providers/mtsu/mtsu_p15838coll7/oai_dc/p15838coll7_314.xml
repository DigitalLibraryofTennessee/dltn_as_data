<dc:description>Noting that "scores and scores of people had declared openly that a negro Bank of Nashville was a matter of impossibility," this advertisement praises the bank for its steady growth and service to its customers. A large insert includes portraits of the officers and directors of the bank. </dc:description>
<dc:description> The One Cent Savings Bank opened on January 16, 1904 at 411 North Cherry Street. Richard Henry Boyd served as President, James C. Napier as cashier-manager, and Preston Taylor as chairman. In 1920, the bank changed its name to the Citizens Savings Bank and Trust Company. Today, Citizens Bank headquarters and operations building is on Heiman Street in Nashville.</dc:description>
