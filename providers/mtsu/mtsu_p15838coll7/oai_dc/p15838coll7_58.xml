<dc:description>Maude Woodfork, a native of Wilson County, was born in 1892. She found professional success as an actress hired to represent the cook attired in apron and bandana on "Aunt Jemima" pancake mix packaging. She studied dramatic arts at Tennessee State University, worked for the WPA in Chicago teaching dramatics and made a career portraying this popular stereotype of a southern cook for Quaker Oats' brand "Aunt Jemima" pancake mix at a time when the popularity of packaged foods went hand in hand with broadcast advertising.</dc:description>
