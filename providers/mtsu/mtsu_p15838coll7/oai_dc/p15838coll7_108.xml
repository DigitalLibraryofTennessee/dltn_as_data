<dc:description>C.C. Dodson was a Knoxville jeweller who had a shop in the Vine Avenue business district. A photograph of his home and family appears to have been taken at the same time as this and at least two other photographs of successful African Americans living in Knoxville at the turn of the twentieth century. This is one of a group of 500 images that were gathered by W.E.B. DuBois and Thomas J. Calloway for display at the Paris Exposition of 1900. The purpose of the photographic exhibit in Paris was to show the history and present status of African Americans. The Library of Congress holds 220 of the photographs, including 24 taken in Knoxville (4), Nashville (16), Chattanooga (3), and Memphis (1), Tennessee. The identity of the photographer is not known, but it is possible it could have been DuBois himself, since he was well familiar with Tennessee, having graduated from Nashville's Fisk University in 1888. During his time at Fisk, he taught during summer breaks in Tennessee's rural areas, before continuing his graduate work at Harvard. In 1897, DuBois joined the faculty at Atlanta University and a good number of the photographs in this collection were also taken there. </dc:description>
