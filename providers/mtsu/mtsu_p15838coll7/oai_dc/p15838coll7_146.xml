<dc:description>The Matt Gardner Homestead interprets African American history as well as agricultural history.  The dining room, pictured here, shows some of the items that a prosperous farmer such as Matt Gardner would have owned.  Matt Gardner was so successful that he was able to make loans to other farmers, both African American and white.</dc:description>
