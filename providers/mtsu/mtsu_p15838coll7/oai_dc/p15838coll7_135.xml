<dc:description>The East Tennessee Iron Manufacturing Company was incorporated in 1847, and was an important part of the iron and railroad industry. The Bluff Furnace began operation in 1856.  In May 1860, it was converted to a coke-fueled furnace.  In November 1860, it failed during operations, and the furnace was demolished.</dc:description>
