<dc:description>A petition to repeal the poll tax.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Merl Eppse was a professor at Tennessee State University from 1928-1960. What is pictured here is a petition to repeal the poll tax. Poll taxes were enacted in Tennessee (and several other Southern states) as a way to disenfranchise those that they did not wish to participate in elections, such as African Americans. First enacted in 1870, it was not implemented by the legislature until 1889. In order to vote, one had to pay the poll tax; this act disenfranchised thousands of African Americans across the state. Beginning in the 1930s, groups such as the Tennessee Press Association and others, began to fight to have the poll tax law repealed. Petitions such as the ones seen here, were also circulated amongst the population and sent to Washington to protest the poll tax. The poll tax in Tennessee was repealed in 1953.</dc:description>
