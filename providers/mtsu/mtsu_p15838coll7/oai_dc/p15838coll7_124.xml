<dc:description>Postcard of the Bijou Theater in Nashville, an African American entertainment venue for roughly forty years.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Bijou Theater was located at 423 4th Avenue North in Nashville. Built in 1904, in 1916 it became one of the South's leading African American theaters. In 1918, African Americans held their own celebrations marking the end of World War I at the Bijou. It was razed in 1957-1958 to build Municipal Auditorium. The Bijou was operated by the Bijou Amusement Company, and one of the first managers was Milton Starr, a white man.</dc:description>
