<dc:description>Even though Knoxville College was a private school, in 1891 the school contracted with the University of Tennessee to provide "separate but equal" industrial education for African Americans in lieu of their attending the publicly funded state university.  The money appropriated by the University of Tennessee could be used only for faculty, students, and equipment, not for buildings or land. While the Freedmen's Bureau had furnished funds for a mechanical and industrial building in 1892, it was the citizens of Knoxville who donated money for the construction of the brick agricultural building in 1905. Knoxville College owned a 78-acre farm with a small herd of dairy cattle, and was a local leader in food production and teaching home skills.</dc:description>
