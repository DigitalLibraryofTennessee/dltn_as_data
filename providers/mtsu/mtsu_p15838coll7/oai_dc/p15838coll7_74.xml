<dc:description>First Baptist Church, located at 379 Beale Street in Memphis, has been a part of Memphis's African American community since the congregation first erected a frame building on Beale Street in 1864.  Beginning in 1866, the congregation began building this building, completing it in c. 1880.  Former president Ulysses Grant visited the church in 1880.  It is considered to be the first brick-constructed, multi-story church built by African Americans in the United States. After a fire in 1925, the interior was rebuilt, and the exterior was painted white in c. 1964.</dc:description>
