<dc:description>Photograph of a rural scene, two men (J.C. Napier on  right) standing in front of a double pen log cabin with saddlebag addition. Another man, who is also wearing a dark suit and white shirt like the others, stands next to the corner of addition. The laundry on the line suggests that the cabin is still inhabited.</dc:description>
<dc:description>James Carroll Napier was born on the western outskirts of Nashville in 1845. His parents, who were slaves at the time of his birth, were freed three years later. They sent James and his siblings to the school of Daniel Wadkins, a free black teacher whose students numbered as many as sixty.  When a white backlash against free blacks caused the closure of the school, Napier's parents sent  him to Ohio to complete his education. After graduating from Howard Law School in Washington, D.C. Napier returned to Nashville, became involved in Republican politics, and practiced law. He was elected to the City Council in 1878, was one of the founders of the National Negro Business League, and served as the appointed Register of the United States Treasury from 1911-1913.</dc:description>
