<dc:description>The Julius Freed House in Trenton was built in 1871 by Julius Freed, a Prussian-born Confederate veteran who moved to Trenton following the Civil War. A Jewish merchant, Julius Freed never fully assimilated in the dominant Southern culture.  As there was no synagogue in Trenton, Freed allowed his home to be used by other Jewish residents of the community to hold observations of Jewish holidays and special occasions. Freed remained prominent in Trenton until his death in 1908. The house is still used as a community center and museum.</dc:description>
