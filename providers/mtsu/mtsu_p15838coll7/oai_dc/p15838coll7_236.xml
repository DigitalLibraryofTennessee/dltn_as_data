<dc:description>Caldonia Fackler "Cal" Johnson (1844-1925), the son of former slaves, was born in Knoxville. In the decades after the American Civil War, Johnson became a prosperous, law-abiding saloon owner, founded a horse-racing track, and owned several race horses. In 1896, he was invited by the East Tennessee Track Association to build a new track located in East Knoxville. He donated property for an African American YWCA in 1906 and constructed this commercial building at the corner of Vine and Central Avenues in 1915.</dc:description>
