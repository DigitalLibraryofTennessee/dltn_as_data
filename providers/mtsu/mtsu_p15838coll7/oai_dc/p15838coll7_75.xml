<dc:description>White clapboard school building with green asphalt side gable roof, central brick chimney, and a central front gable extension. The most prominent feature of the building is a bank of four double hung, nine over nine, windows centered on the front extension. Entrances, covered by wooden awnings, are located on either side of the extension, with smaller, eight over eight, double hung windows either side. A sign reading &#8220;Community Center&#8221; is centered over the large front bank of windows and a fixed flag pole stands in front of the building.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Dunbar Public School was built as a Rosenwald School in c. 1923.  It was the only African American school in the community, and served grades kindergarten through eighth.  It closed with integration and now serves as a community center.</dc:description>
