<dc:description>Hand-drawn map showing location of various property owners on residential streets adjacent to a business district.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This map was used in the Supreme Court case of Weidner v Freeman, 1911, to support claim by plaintiff that some residences in the neighborhood, which was within several blocks of Chattanooga's African American business district, were being used for prostitution and therefore depressing real estate values. One of the assertions being made was that if the illegal activity continued, the neighborhood would continue to become marginalized to the extent that residential properties would only be saleable to African Americans.</dc:description>
