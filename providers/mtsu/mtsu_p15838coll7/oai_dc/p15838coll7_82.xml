<dc:description>Doe Creek School, a one-room log school.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Doe Creek School, located a few miles south of Scotts Hill in Henderson County, served as a one-room school and church for generations.  This log cabin, dating to c. 1870, is typical of the school buildings used across Tennessee by both white and African American children well into the 20th century.  This served as a school until the 1950s.  It is the last one-room school house in the region.</dc:description>
