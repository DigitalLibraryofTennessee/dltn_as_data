<dc:description>The Reverend Lonzie Odie Taylor (circa 1899-1977) was pastor of Olivet Baptist Church in Memphis in the 1930s, 1940s, and early 1950s. He was also a photographer who recorded the daily life of the community in which he lived. Posed studio shots, such as this one, give evidence that his photographic output was of value to his subjects. Historically, soldiers in uniform have had portraits made for the purpose of recording patriotic service or creating  a keepsake image for loved ones. Photographs might also be commissioned to record a military promotion or commendation. In this case, the soldier is wearing a medal, which indicates that he has performed meritorious service and possibly seen combat.</dc:description>
