<dc:coverage>United States -- Tennessee -- Chattanooga</dc:coverage>
<dc:description>Two African American males, in billed caps and boots, sweeping litter onto a shovel in front of a metal trash bin on wheels. The man at left, who wears some type of work coverall, appears to be smoking a pipe, while the man right wears a worn sweater with a hole at shoulder. A car parked at the curb around the corner is partially visible and a placard on the building behind the men reads "Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Company."</dc:description>
<dc:description>These two street cleaners appear in a downtown setting, in front of a building with a clean stone facade and modern concrete sidewalk with stone curbing, at a time when it appears to be somewhat chilly and when no other persons were at the scene--possibly early morning. Although this is a public setting, work hours for African American menial laborers may have been restricted so they were virtually invisible to many of those who worked in this district.</dc:description>
