<dc:description>Dr. Philander P. Claxton served as the High School Inspector, Department of Education, at the University of Tennessee during the early decades of the twentieth century. This letter, from Wallace Buttrick, Secretary, was part of a general fact-finding initiative to determine the status of secondary education for African Americans in the southern states. It apparently included a questionnaire and Claxton collected information regarding public, tax-supported high schools for negroes in Tennessee. His report contained the following facts about schools in Tennessee's six largest cities: Kortrecht High, Memphis, six teachers, 42 boys, 96 girls building valued at $10,000;
Chattanooga  Howard High School,  2-3 teachers, 16 boys, 46 girls $30,000 building;
