<dc:description>Golden Hill Cemetery in Clarksville dates to 1863, and may be the oldest tract of land continuously owned by African Americans in Clarksville. Stephen Cole, a former slave, purchased the land in 1863, and the cemetery was formally incorporated in 1882.  A number of veterans are buried at Golden Hill, including Stephen Cole's son, Edward.  Part of the significance of this site is that it is associated with the establishment of a distinct African American community in Clarksville.</dc:description>
