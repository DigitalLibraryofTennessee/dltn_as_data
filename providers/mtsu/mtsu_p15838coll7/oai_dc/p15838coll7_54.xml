<dc:description>Valaida Snow was a blues singer and musician, and was known as the "Queen of the Trumpet" for her ability on that instrument.  She became a professional musician by the age of 15, and spent much of the 1920s touring the United States with various musical reviews.  She appeared in some feature films in the late 1930s, and toured Europe in 1939.  While performing in Denmark, she was arrested by Nazis and may have spent nearly two years in a concentration camp (Wester-Faengler).  After her release in a prisoner exchange, Snow returned to New York City and tried to regain fame as a musician.  She died in 1956.</dc:description>
