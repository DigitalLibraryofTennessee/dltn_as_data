<dc:description>A black hearse drawn by two white horses stands facing a single white horse harnessed to a black open-top buggy whose driver wears a bowler hat, in front of a frame building with G.W. Franklin, Undertaker. painted on its side. There is another horse-drawn hearse standing behind the one at center of the image, and an electric pole visible at left. A canvas awning appears to have been drawn up above the door of the business.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Born in Georgia, G.W. Franklin moved his funeral business to Chattanooga in 1894, and was the first African American funeral director and embalmer in Chattanooga. Franklin was a friend of Booker T. Washington and a member of the National Negro Business League. The funeral home remains in business, and is operated and owned by Franklin's descendants. Another image of G.W. Franklin's funeral home was included in the Paris Exposition of 1900, as part of an exhibit organized by W.E.B. DuBois and Thomas J. Calloway. </dc:description>
