<dc:description>The Empress of the Blues, Bessie Smith (1894-1937), was one of the greatest singers of the 1920s and 1930s. Smith started her singing career as a street performer and was later a prot&#233;g&#233; of Ma Rainey. In 1915, Smith went out on her own to become a popular vaudeville performer. In 1923 she made her debut as a recording artist for the Columbia label and during her recording career she performed with blues and jazz greats such as Louis Armstrong, Coleman Hawkins and James P. Johnson. Smith recorded Oh Daddy Blues in 1923.</dc:description>
