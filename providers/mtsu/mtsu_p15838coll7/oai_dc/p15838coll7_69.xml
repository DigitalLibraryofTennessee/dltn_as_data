<dc:description>This photograph of a man and a woman seated side by side in front of a white frame building is matted in light brown surrounded by a white spacer and a carved green frame.  A figure standing behind them is obscured by the way the image has been divided by two openings in the mat. The bearded man seated at left is smiling, wearing a white shirt, bow tie, and dark suit and holding an open bible in both hands. The woman seated at right with her hands in her lap, has broad high cheekbones and a solemn expression. She wears a light colored hood and scarf, a dark dress, and a white apron. </dc:description>
<dc:description>Matt Gardner was born into slavery in 1847 in Alabama, and sold to Richard C. Gardner, a Nashville merchant and plantation owner in Elkton, Tennessee, in 1862.   In 1877, he married Henrietta Jenkins. In the late 1880s, Matt Gardner financed and helped to build the first school for African Americans in Elkton, as well as providing room and board at his farm for the teacher.  In addition to farming, Matt Gardner traveled around Giles County, Tennessee and Limestone County, Alabama, preaching at different churches on alternating Sundays.  Henrietta and Matt were the parents of eleven children. Henrietta died on July 23, 1940.  When Matt Gardner died June 5, 1943, more than 1,000 people attended his funeral.</dc:description>
