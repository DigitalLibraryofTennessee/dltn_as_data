<dc:description>Aaron Douglas, born in Topeka, Kansas, in 1898, was one of the leading visual artists of the Harlem Renaissance. He was commissioned in 1930 to paint a series of murals in Cravath Hall at Fisk University. These murals depict African American contributions to American history and society. He returned to Fisk University as a professor in the late 1930s and founded the Art Department. Douglas died in Nashville in 1979.</dc:description>
