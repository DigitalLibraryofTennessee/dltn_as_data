<dc:description>The front page of the Maryville Republican, an African American newspaper published in Maryville, Tennessee during Reconstruction.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Maryville Republican was published by William Scott, Sr., a free black that moved to East Tennessee from North Carolina in 1847.  Following the Civil War, Scott and his family moved to Nashville as Scott was a delegate to the Colored Men's Convention.  During his time in Nashville, Scott and his son started the Colored Tennessean, the first African American newspaper in the state.  Scott moved back to Maryville in 1866, and started publishing the Maryville Republican.  The newspaper remained in publication until the 1880s.</dc:description>
