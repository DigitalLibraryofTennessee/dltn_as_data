<dc:description>The Knoxville College Hospital was built with funds left by Eliza B. Wallace in a will to Knoxville College. The modern facility filled a need in the community for professional nursing instruction, provided medical care to Knoxville College students, and was open to outside patients. Private physicians were able to practice there as well, which helped make Knoxville a center for African American health care in the early decades of the twentieth century.</dc:description>
