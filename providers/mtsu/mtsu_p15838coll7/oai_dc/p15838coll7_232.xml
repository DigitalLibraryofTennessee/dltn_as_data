<dc:description>The Odd Fellows Cemetery was established in 1870. The Odd Fellows (the African American group is also known as the Grand United Order of Odd Fellows) were established in 1843 while the first Odd Fellows lodge for African Americans in Tennessee was established circa 1870. The Odd Fellows was a fraternal group with regalia and ranks for its members. Prominent Knoxvillians buried at this cemetery include Cal Johnson, Knoxville's first African American millionaire, and William Yardley, alderman and gubernatorial candidate.</dc:description>
