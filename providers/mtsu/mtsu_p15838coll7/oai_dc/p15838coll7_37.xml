<dc:description>Scan of cover of Zip Coon: A Popular Negro Song.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The song &#8220;Zip Coon&#8221; was originally performed by George Washington Dixon in 1834 as a caricature of free, urban African American. He was portrayed as a well-dressed dandy who "put on airs" and pretended to be above his station.   White audiences, confident in their social (and racial) superiority, were entertained by Zip Coon's misplaced attempts to seem clever, educated, and sophisticated. The tune used for the song will be familiar to contemporary listeners as "Turkey in the Straw."</dc:description>
