<dc:description>A group of twelve women, all facing to the right (to the left for the camera), most of whom are African American.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Taken before a cloth backdrop, this is obviously a posed group portrait. These women are wearing high-collared, long-sleeved blouses, white nurses pinafores, and white caps. They also have what appear to be Red Cross emblems on the left sleeve, which suggests that they may have been in training for the public health service or other early efforts of the American Red Cross.</dc:description>
