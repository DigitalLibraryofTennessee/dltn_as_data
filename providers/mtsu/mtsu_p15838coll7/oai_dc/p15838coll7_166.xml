<dc:description>Orange paper with black border and type,  "Souvenir Program of the Cotton Makers Jubilee, Church Park Auditorium, May 12, 13, 14, 1937" with a photographic image at lower center, and a tribute to ..."Mr. R.R.Church, Dean of Beale Street, who by his encouragement has helped us to make a success of this year's Jubilee..." below.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This is the first year of the Cotton Makers Jubilee, which had evolved from the "Colored Jubilee Committee" in 1935, to the "Cotton-Makers Fiesta" in 1936, before it was officially named the Cotton Makers Jubilee in 1937. It was the African American version of Memphis's Cotton Carnival. The two festivals were concurrent and in later years some of the ceremonial events featured their honorary kings and queens appearing together.</dc:description>
