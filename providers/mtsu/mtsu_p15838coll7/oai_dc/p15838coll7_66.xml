<dc:description>Sitka School was an African American school in rural Gibson County.  It was built in 1942 by the community as a two-room frame building and had electrical wiring.  The school was set on acres of land, and the community also donated a playground for the school.  It is typical of the types of rural schools available to African Americans in Tennessee during this time period.</dc:description>
