<dc:description>Ticket and stub for a speech by Roscoe Conklin (sic) Simmons on Sunday April 6 at the Ryman Auditorium. "Elks Ed Committee" appears at the bottom of the ticket.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Presumably, the speaker was Roscoe Conkling Simmons (1881-1951), a popular orator and Republican politician who had served as a foreign correspondent for the Chicago Defender during World War I. The addition of "Elks Ed Committee" at the bottom of the ticket suggests that the fraternal organization may have sponsored this public talk.</dc:description>
