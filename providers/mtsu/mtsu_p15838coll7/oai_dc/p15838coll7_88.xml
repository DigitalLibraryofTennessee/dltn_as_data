<dc:description>Five African American men (and possibly a white supervisor at front left) standing in large brick chamber, with arched doorways letting in outside light. Long cylindrical hollow rods are attached to metal racks, and one that appears to be a cast plaster "core" is being lifted at one end by a metal hook attached to a metal rod inserted in the end of the core.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The predecessor to the United States Pipe &amp; Foundry Company, the Chattanooga Pipe and Foundry Works, was opened in 1877. Over the years the company consolidated with others to form the United States Pipe &amp; Foundry company. Many of the company's workers, particularly during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, were African American.</dc:description>
