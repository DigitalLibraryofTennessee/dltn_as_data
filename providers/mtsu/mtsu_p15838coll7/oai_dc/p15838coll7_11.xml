</dc:description>
<dc:description>Miller was a former slave who moved to Chattanooga from Georgia in October 1864. He worked as a pressman on several newspapers before starting his own paper, the Weekly Blade  in 1898.  The Blade ran for twelve years, and Miller became known for his condemnation of segregation. In 1905, Miller was one of the organizers in Chattanooga of the streetcar system in protest of a 1905 state law that segregated streetcar passengers.  He started his own taxi service in 1905, the Hack Line, that ran between Chattanooga and outlying African American communities.</dc:description>
