<dc:description>Cover of Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All its Phases. Miss Ida B. Wells. New York Age Print, 1892. A cream colored booklet with image of the author.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Ida B. Wells (1862-1931) was born in Holly Springs, Mississippi, the daughter of former slaves. While  teaching in a public school, just outside of the city of Memphis, she mounted an unsuccessful challenge to the segregation of public railroad cars in Memphis. Although she was at first awarded damages in her lawsuit challenging the Chesapeake, Ohio and Southwestern Railroad Company, the victory was overturned by the Tennessee Supreme Court in 1887. Wells became an outspoken advocate for African American rights and began publishing articles in African American newspapers, first in Memphis and later nationall. In 1892, Wells wrote to the New York Age, to protest the closing of her  Memphis newspaper, The Free Speech. This booklet, which was reprinted in 1893 and 1894, is an expanded version of her June 25, 1892 editorial.</dc:description>
