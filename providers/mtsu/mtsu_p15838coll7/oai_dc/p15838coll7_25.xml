<dc:description>The liner notes for this compilation of recordings, written by Dave Moore, indicate that Josh White's performances during this period, with both black and white performers of the day, including Billie Holiday and Pete Seeger, ranged from gospel to mainstream blues. They also earned him notoriety by combining familiar traditional melodies with protests against inequality for African Americans. White became so well-known that he was invited to perform for President and Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt. He was also brought before Senator Joseph McCarthy's House Un-American Activities Committee, but managed to emerge from that encounter unscathed and continued to perform into the 1950s and 1960s.</dc:description>
