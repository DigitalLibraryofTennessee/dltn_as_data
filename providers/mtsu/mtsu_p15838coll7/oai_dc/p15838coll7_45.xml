<dc:description>Principal James A. Henry and members of the graduating class of Howard High School.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Although it had several early locations, possibly also including a church, before the construction of its own building on 9th Street, historian Rita Lorraine Hubbard [African American of Chattanooga: A History of Unsung Heroes, 2007] believes that Howard School may originally have been housed in a former federal hospital barracks on Chestnut Street. It was founded as a "free" school for African Americans circa 1865, and named for General O.O. Howard, a commissioner of the Freedmen's Bureau. By 1872, it had become the first public school (for either white or African American children) in Chattanooga. Professor James Henry, shown in this photograph, was the first African American principal of the school. A native of Buffalo, New York, he graduated from Atlanta University in 1883, came to Chattanooga to teach at Howard in 1884, and was present at the school's first graduation in 1886.   He is surrounded in the photograph by members of the graduating class.</dc:description>
