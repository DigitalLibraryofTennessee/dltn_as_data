<dc:description>During the early twentieth century, Nashville's Jefferson Street developed into a thriving African American community.  Numerous African American businesses and churches were located in this area, and the area later became famous for its jazz and blues.  This sanctuary for the Jefferson Street Church of Christ was built in 1927.  The building was razed during urban renewal.</dc:description>
