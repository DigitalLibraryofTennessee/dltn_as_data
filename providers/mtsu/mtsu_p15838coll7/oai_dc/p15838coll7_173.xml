<dc:description>Yale educated, John W. Manning was the first African American principal of Austin High School. Funds to build the city's first African American secondary school were raised by Emily Austin, a white Philadelphian who had moved to Knoxville to teach black children in 1870. The school, located at 327 Central Avenue, opened in 1879. Manning served as principal from 1881-1912.</dc:description>
