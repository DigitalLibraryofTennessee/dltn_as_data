<dc:description>The United Brothers of Friendship and Sisters of the Mysterious Ten was a benevolent society first organized in 1861 in Louisville, Kentucky.  After being disrupted by the Civil War, the group was reorganized in 1868 by William H. Gibson. The group offered sickness, disability and burial benefits to its members.  The UBF had lodges throughout the nation, and national membership was 100,000 by 1892.</dc:description>
