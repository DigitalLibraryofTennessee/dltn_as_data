<dc:description>This group of formally dressed African American men and women are posed on the steps of a frame building with brick foundation. The location is the same as a 1908-1909 image of LeMoyne Normal Institute in which Principal L.T. Larsen poses with students and teachers. In this image, the men wear suits and ties; the women high collared shirtwaist dresses or skirt and blouse combinations. Two students in the front row display a LeMoyne pennant.</dc:description>
<dc:description>In 1870, Dr. Francis J. LeMoyne, a Pennsylvania doctor and abolitionist, donated $20,000 to the American Missionary Association to build an elementary and secondary school for prospective teachers. LeMoyne Normal Institute was the original name of LeMoyne College.</dc:description>
