<dc:description>Mt. Olivet Cemetery, an African American cemetery, was established in Jackson in 1885. The establishment of this cemetery in 1885 shows the move towards Jim Crow segregation following Reconstruction in Tennessee, as the divisions between the races became more marked as the 19th century waned. More than 1600 people are buried in this cemetery.  This marker for F.E. Grimes is one of several handmade markers found in this cemetery.  </dc:description>
