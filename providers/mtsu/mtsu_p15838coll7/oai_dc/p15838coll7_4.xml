<dc:description>The Warfield Lodge No. 44, F. &amp; A.M. (P.H.A.) dates to the 1890s, when the Tennessee Grand Lodge issued the charter for the group.  The lodge purchased a lot in Clarksville at the corner of Ninth and Main Streets in 1899, and by 1901 owned the property.  The first lodge hall burned in 1911, and was rebuilt/remodeled in 1912.</dc:description>
