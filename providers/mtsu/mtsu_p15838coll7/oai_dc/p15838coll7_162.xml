<dc:description>This black and white photograph shows a Victorian, cross-gable, two-story frame house with fancy Craftsman detailed pediments in double front gables, fancy lightning rods atop all visible gable peaks, and a brick chimney.  The house is approached by terraced steps and a central sidewalk leading to the front door inside an enclosed porch. There are two trees on either side of the sidewalk, and a neat lawn surrounded by a low iron fence around the lot. A utility pole and wires are visible in front of the house.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This photograph, which was captioned, for purposes of display at the Paris Exposition of 1900, as "Negro Homes--home of R.R. Church, Memphis, Tenn. (exterior)" is one of at least twenty-four of African American businesses and homes in Tennessee that are part of a group of 500 images that were gathered by W.E.B. DuBois and Thomas J. Calloway. Robert Reed Church and his son Robert Reed Church, Jr., were two of Memphis's most prominent African American citizens. Church built a park and auditorium for on six acres of land on Beale Street in 1899. The purpose of the photographic exhibit in Paris was to show the history and present status of African Americans.  220 of the photographs are now in the collections of the Library of Congress, including 24 taken in Tennessee: Knoxville (4), Nashville (16), Chattanooga (3), and Memphis (1). The identity of the photographer is not known, but it is possible it could have been DuBois himself, since he was well familiar with Tennessee, having graduated from Nashville's Fisk University in 1888. During his time at Fisk, he taught during summer breaks in Tennessee's rural areas, before continuing his graduate work at Harvard. In 1897, DuBois joined the faculty at Atlanta University and a good number of the photographs in this collection were also taken there. http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/anedub/</dc:description>
