<dc:description>The Reverend Lonzie Odie Taylor (circa 1899-1977) was pastor of Olivet Baptist Church in Memphis in the 1930s, 1940s, and early 1950s. He was also a skilled photographer and many of his images captured people and places in the Beale Street business district. In this photograph, everyone in the restaurant is looking directly at the photographer, acknowledging his right to record the moment.</dc:description>
