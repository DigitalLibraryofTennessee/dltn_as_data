<dc:description>Anderson Hall, located on the campus of Maryville College, was built in 1870.  Part of the funds used to build the building came from the Freedmen's Bureau. Maryville College was one of the first colleges in the United States to admit African Americans, Native Americans, and women, in addition to male students, as early as 1869.</dc:description>
