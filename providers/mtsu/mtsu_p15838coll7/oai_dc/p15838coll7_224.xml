<dc:description>Jim Crow Blues, with lyrics by Harlem Renaissance poet Waring Cuney, was one of six songs protesting the status of African Americans, which were recorded by Josh[ua Daniel] White (1914-1969) under the title "Southern Exposure: An Album of Jim Crow Blues." The songs were accompanied by notes written by Richard Wright. Other titles included in the same recording session were: Defense Factory Blues, Bad Housing Blues, Hard Times Blues, Uncle Sam Says, and Southern Exposure, which apparently addressed inequitable treatment of African Americans in the mobilization for World War II.</dc:description>
