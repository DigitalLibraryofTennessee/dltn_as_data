<dc:description>This photograph is one of at least sixteen images of African American businesses and homes in Nashville (several additional images of Fisk University and Roger Williams University students can be accessed here: http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/anedub/) that are part of a group of 500 images that were gathered by W.E.B. DuBois and Thomas J. Calloway. The purpose of the photographic exhibit in Paris was to show the history and present status of African Americans. 220 of the photographs are now in the collections of the Library of Congress, including 24 taken in Knoxville (4), Nashville (16), Chattanooga (3), and Memphis (1), Tennessee. The identity of the photographer is not known, but it is possible it could have been DuBois himself, since he was well familiar with Tennessee, having graduated from Nashville's Fisk University in 1888. During his time at Fisk, he taught during summer breaks in Tennessee's rural areas, before continuing his graduate work at Harvard. In 1897, DuBois joined the faculty at Atlanta University and a good number of the photographs in this collection were also taken there.</dc:description>
