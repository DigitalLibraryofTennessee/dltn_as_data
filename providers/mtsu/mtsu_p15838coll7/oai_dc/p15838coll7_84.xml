<dc:description>Blanket used on Pullman Car trains by passengers.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Brown blankets, such as the one pictured here, were used by passengers on Pullman Train cars.  When they became threadbare and deemed no longer fit for service, the brown blankets were dyed blue and given to Pullman porters.  This ensured that white passengers would never accidentally receive a blanket used by an African American porter.</dc:description>
