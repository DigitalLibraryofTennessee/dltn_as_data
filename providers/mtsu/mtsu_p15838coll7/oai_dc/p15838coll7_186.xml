<dc:description>"Big Detail" advertisement, inviting "colored people only" to the Ryman Auditorium, July 4, 1910, to hear "the best caller in Nashville" on the Johnson-Jeffries Prize Fight.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The match between Jack Johnson, an African American, and James Jeffries, a white former heavyweight boxing champion, was hailed as "The Fight of the Century." Johnson, to the surprise of the white media, won the match handily. The advertisement is for an event the day of the fight at the Ryman Auditorium. It shows that the Ryman Auditorium was used by African Americans for a number of events during the period of segregation.</dc:description>
