<dc:description>A number of African American men, many in chauffeurs caps and one in what appears to be a policeman's uniform, posed alongside two early automobiles, behind a two story frame house, and next to a one story building with tile roof overhang, cylindrical gas pump with lozenge-shaped orb reading "motor fuel" and free-standing marquee with logo and "That Good Gulf Gasoline. Supreme Motor Oil". An advertisement for Dunlop Tires is painted on back wall.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Vine Avenue Service Station was one of several black-owned service stations located in the heart of the African American business district of Knoxville, along with at least three hotels, a number of taxi cab companies, several funeral homes and mortuaries, three drug stores, and other businesses serving the African American community.</dc:description>
