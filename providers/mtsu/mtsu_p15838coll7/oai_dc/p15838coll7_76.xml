<dc:description>A black hearse drawn by two white horses stands out front of a frame building with G.W. Franklin, Undertaker. painted across the front at top. A single white horse and white buggy, with driver in bowler hat, stands facing the hearse. Leafless trees in front of the building suggest that the photograph was made in winter.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This photograph is one of at least three images of African American businesses and homes in Chattanooga ("Union Hotel" and "Negro Homes--the Poorer Class in Chattanooga, Tenn.", which can be accessed here: http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/anedub/)  that are part of a group of 500 images that were gathered by W.E.B. DuBois and Thomas J. Calloway. The purpose of the photographic exhibit in Paris was to show the history and present status of African Americans. 220 of the photographs are now in the collections of the Library of Congress, including 24 taken in Knoxville (4), Nashville (16), Chattanooga (3), and Memphis (1), Tennessee. The identity of the photographer is not known, but it is possible it could have been DuBois himself, since he was well familiar with Tennessee, having graduated from Nashville's Fisk University in 1888. During his time at Fisk, he taught during summer breaks in Tennessee's rural areas, before continuing his graduate work at Harvard. In 1897, DuBois joined the faculty at Atlanta University and a good number of the photographs in this collection were also taken there.</dc:description>
