<dc:description>Image of "The Bottoms," an African American neighborhood in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. It was destroyed by urban renewal and the building of Broad Street.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Bottoms was located near the south-west section of downtown Murfreesboro, and developed as a blue-collar neighborhood during Reconstruction. Although some whites lived in the area, it was largely an African American neighborhood. The area often flooded due to its proximity to Lytle Creek.</dc:description>
