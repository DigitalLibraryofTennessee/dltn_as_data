<dc:description>The front page of the Nashville Globe, an African American newspaper published in Nashville, Tennessee during the first half of the twentieth century.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Following the passage of the law in 1905 that segregated street cars in Tennessee, Richard H. Boyd and a group of Nashville businessmen decided to start an African American newspaper.  This paper, the Nashville Globe, first appeared in newsstands in January 1906, and initial editions promoted the boycott of streetcars in reaction to the segregation law. The paper had close ties with the National Baptist Publishing Board, and all four original officers of the corporation &#8211; Henry A. Boyd, Dock A. Hart, J.O. Battle, and Charles Burrill &#8211; all worked for the National Baptist Publishing Board.  The Globe favored businessmen, the Republican Party, preached an ethos of self-help and betterment, and supported the philosophies and teachings of Booker T. Washington.  It remained in publication until 1960.</dc:description>

Report reached Nashville from vat
lious sources bringing
that it is estimated that by conserva-tive
thought 400,000 Negro soldiers
are fighting with the American
annle3 and their allies in France,
and that their deeds of heroism are
being heralded to the four corners
of the world. The allied generals
hare been amazed at the splendid

An amusing incident took piaca

of the colored soldiers had formed a

changed his voice with each
song or hymn. "What do you sing?'
called down from the upper deck, a
yood natured son of the Emerald Isle,
yuitk as a flash came the answer,
"Sometimes I sing bass ana some-times
I sing soprano.' And it was
true, for in the chorus he adapted
himself to the type of the song he
was singing, to the to
the other singers, and above ali, per-haps,
to his mood. Because they
