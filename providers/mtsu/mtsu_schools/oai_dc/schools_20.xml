<dc:description>According to Mrs. W. H. Potila, who has done exhaustive research in the Eagleville area, the first post Civil War School established
in Eagleville was the Savage School, named for the headmaster, Professor G. M. Savage and chartered in 1865. The school consisted of a building with an auditorium, a "boarding house" with rooms for girls. There was a building with ten rooms for boys and a residence for
teachers. The curriculum consisted of English, Hebrew, Latin, French, Greek, German, elocution, natural sciences, mathematics, mental and moral science, penmanship, music, and bookkeeping. The school was still flourishing in 1888 when a combination catalog and school roster listed 178 students from Chattanooga, Shelbyville, Nashville, and Texas as well as Culleoka, Ruch Creek, Rockvale, Chapel Hill, Adamsville, Winchester, Fairfield, Versailles, Fayette Corner, Hickory Valley, Lone Elm, Alisona, College Grove, Luling, [and] Knoxville.</dc:description>
