  <abstract>Formal studio portrait, in color, of a young man standing with his right hand resting on two books stacked on top of a ornately carved table in front of a painted backdrop of an arched window looking out to a landscape. The beardless young man wears his cap cocked slightly to his right, and his coat is open to reveal a watch chain and wrinkled white shirt. This carte de visite has the name "C Giers" and "Nashville" printed on the lower margin.</abstract>

      <title>Shades of Gray and Blue</title>
    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>In Tennessee, we have all heard stories of life and death on the stateâ€™s Civil War battlefields, but what happened to the men, women, and children who stayed at home? Their stories, seen through the lens of the objects that were a part of their daily lives, reflect the ways Tennesseans adapted, coped, and thrived during a war whose reverberations are still felt today. Visit the Shades of Gray and Blue project site for additional options for browsing the collection, contextual essays, and lesson plans. This project is a collaborative effort of the Middle Tennessee State University Walker Library, the Center for Historic Preservation at Middle Tennessee State University, and Vanderbilt University Libraries.</abstract>
