  <abstract>This is the reverse side of the medal. It shows what appears to be a toga-clad Roman emperor placing a wreath on the head of a kneeling young woman, while four other women (perhaps representing virtues) stand behind her. The inscription: DISSOCIATA LOCIS CONCORDI PACE LIGAVIT appears around the top edge of the medal. Type along the bottom edge includes the name of the artist who designed the medal: Leonard C. Wyon. The name S.Bond is engraved on the edge of the medal.</abstract>

      <title>Shades of Gray and Blue</title>
    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>In Tennessee, we have all heard stories of life and death on the stateâ€™s Civil War battlefields, but what happened to the men, women, and children who stayed at home? Their stories, seen through the lens of the objects that were a part of their daily lives, reflect the ways Tennesseans adapted, coped, and thrived during a war whose reverberations are still felt today. Visit the Shades of Gray and Blue project site for additional options for browsing the collection, contextual essays, and lesson plans. This project is a collaborative effort of the Middle Tennessee State University Walker Library, the Center for Historic Preservation at Middle Tennessee State University, and Vanderbilt University Libraries.</abstract>
