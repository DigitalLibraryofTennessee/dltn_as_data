  <abstract>This three-quarter length image of a bearded African American man in young middle age shows him holding a folded white paper in his right hand as he moves forward. He stands next to a stone wall that has remnants of former posters or notices, the word "black" incised into the wall and visible at top is what appears to be a sign with the printed words "the polls."</abstract>

      <title>Shades of Gray and Blue</title>
    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>In Tennessee, we have all heard stories of life and death on the stateâ€™s Civil War battlefields, but what happened to the men, women, and children who stayed at home? Their stories, seen through the lens of the objects that were a part of their daily lives, reflect the ways Tennesseans adapted, coped, and thrived during a war whose reverberations are still felt today. Visit the Shades of Gray and Blue project site for additional options for browsing the collection, contextual essays, and lesson plans. This project is a collaborative effort of the Middle Tennessee State University Walker Library, the Center for Historic Preservation at Middle Tennessee State University, and Vanderbilt University Libraries.</abstract>
