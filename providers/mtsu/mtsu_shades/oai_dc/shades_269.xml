<dc:description>Fort Sanders, which sat atop a fortified hill just north of the Kingston Pike in Knoxville, Tennessee, was built by U.S. Army troops under the direction of West Point-trained engineer Orlando M. Poe.  Originally named Fort Loudon, Poe suggested changing the name to honor his friend Brigadier General William Sanders who was killed Nov. 19, 1863, ten days before Confederate soldiers were soundly defeated trying to regain control of Knoxville.</dc:description>
