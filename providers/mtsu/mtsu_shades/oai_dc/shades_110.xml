<dc:title>Fisk University, showing former Union Army barracks</dc:title>

<dc:description>This image depicts a row of buildings with a continuous long porch that appears to be a destination for people of all ages walking, running, and riding in a carriage. The building appears to be in a fenced complex, behind which can be seen a city view houses, other structures, and a smoke stack.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Fisk Free Colored School was founded in 1866 on the site of the former Federal Fort Gillem. The barracks were used as university buildings until replaced by more permanent structures. The school was named after General Clinton Bowen Fisk who arrived with Union occupying forces in Nashville in 1862. Enrollment topped 900 students in the first year and, in 1867, the school was incorporated as Fisk University. One of the original barracks buildings remains in use today as the Little Theatre.  </dc:description>
