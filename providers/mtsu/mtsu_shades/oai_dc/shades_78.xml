<dc:date>ca. 1850</dc:date>
<dc:description>This house, once owned by relatives of William McKissack,  is in private hands today. It was constructed of brick from McKissack's brickyard in Spring Hill, TN.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The William McKissack family, originally from North Carolina, moved to Spring Hill in 1834. They brought with them slaves who learned to make bricks. McKissack's brick yard supplied materials for this and other substantial houses in the area. Descendants of Moses McKissack formed one of Tennessee's first architectural and engineering firms. McKissack and McKissack, still in operation today, is one of the nation's oldest African American owned architecture firms.</dc:description>
