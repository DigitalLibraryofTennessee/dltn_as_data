<dc:title>Portrait of Catherine Hunt Holding Hunt Child</dc:title>
<dc:date>ca. 1852-1854</dc:date>
<dc:description>This round black and white photograph depicts a young African American woman holding a white baby.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Catherine Hunt was a slave to the William Hunt Family of Memphis prior to the Civil War. This photograph shows her as a smiling young woman holding a happy white baby close to her chest and nestling his or her head with her cheek.The Hunt home was an imposing brick mansion on the outskirts of downtown Memphis. It served as temporary residence for both Confederate and Union officers during the war and is also thought to have been a Freedmen's School for several years afterwards. Perhaps Catherine had the opportunity to attend the school or even to teach there as Memphis received a large population of ex-slaves from the surrounding area during and after the war.</dc:description>
