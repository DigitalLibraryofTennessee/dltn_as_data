<dc:title>Bauhof Inscription, Hazen's Monument</dc:title>
<dc:date>1864</dc:date>
<dc:description>Inscribed limestone reads: J.C. Bauhof, Co. A. 115th Ohio</dc:description>
<dc:description>Hazen's Monument was built of local limestone and constructed by soldiers on the battlefield at Stones River only months after the battle. In 1864, two German-American soldiers/stonemasons from the 115th Ohio Volunteer Infantry, Daniel C. Miller and J.C. Bauhof, carved the inscription on the monument.  The south face reads: "Hazen's Brigade--To The Memory of Its' Soldiers Who Fell at Stones River, Dec. 31st, 1862." "Their Faces towards Heaven, Their Feet to the Foe." Recognition of those soldiers who fell at Shiloh and the names of the soldiers are found on other faces. The concepts of death and the afterlife centered around the idea of the "good death." Officers spent countless hours writing to the families of lost loved ones to assure them that the fallen soldier had died bravely {"their feet to the foe") with a firm belief in the afterlife ("their faces towards heaven").</dc:description>
