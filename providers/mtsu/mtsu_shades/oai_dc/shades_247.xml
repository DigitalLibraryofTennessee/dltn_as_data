<dc:description>This three-quarter length image of a bearded African American man in young middle age shows him holding a folded white paper in his right hand as he moves forward. He stands next to a stone wall that has remnants of former posters or notices, the word "black" incised into the wall and visible at top is what appears to be a sign with the printed words "the polls."</dc:description>
<dc:description>After Alfred R. Waud's cover image "The First Vote" was published in Harper's Weekly in late 1867, anticipating the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment granting African American males the right to vote, other artists, like Thomas Waterman Wood, picked up the theme.  Here Wood has chosen to portray a young middle aged man with hands worn by work and rumpled clothing and hat. His eyes and expression appear bright and hopeful as he approaches the poll to cast a vote for the first time in his life.</dc:description>
