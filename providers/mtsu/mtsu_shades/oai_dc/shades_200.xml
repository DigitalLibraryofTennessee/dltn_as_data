<dc:description>Angola Plantation, located in the cotton belt of Louisiana, belonged to Adelicia and Joseph Acklen. While Adelicia remained in Nashville after the Civil War began, her husband, Joseph, oversaw their interests at Angola Plantation. After Joseph's death, Adelicia took matters into her own hands, making sure that the Acklen cotton was transported to market regardless of battle lines or blockades.</dc:description>
