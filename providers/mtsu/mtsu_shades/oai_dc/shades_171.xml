<dc:description>Moses McKissack III (1879-1952) moved to Nashville in 1905 and began working as an architect, drawing on skills that he had learned from his father, Gabriel Moses McKissack (1840-1922), in Pulaski. Gabriel was born into slavery in Spring Hill, Tennessee, where he learned his trade from his father, a master brick mason. The year after he designed the Carnegie Library for Fisk University, McKissack was listed as an architect in the Nashville City Directory. This fine building continues in use today.</dc:description>
