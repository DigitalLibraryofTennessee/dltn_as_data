<dc:description>This black and white topographic map of upper East Tennessee appears to have been folded or bound into a book or booklet.  The text under the map reads: "prepared under the direction of Capt. O.M. Poe, Corps of Engineers &amp; Chief Mil Div of the Mississippi, from data furnished by Capt. O.M. Poe and Professor J.M. Safford." The map bears the signature of W.L.B. Jenney, Capt. U.S.A.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This map, which shows railroad lines, ferries, roads, and bridges in the upper East Tennessee corridor, appears to have been based upon Tennessee State Geologist James M. Safford's 1855 map of the state, which would have been the most detailed topographic map available at the time. Even though several of Tennessee's railroad lines had been completed prior to 1855, Safford did not show them on his map. When issued, this map might even have been considered confidential, for this information would have been critical to the movement of troops and war supplies for both sides.</dc:description>
