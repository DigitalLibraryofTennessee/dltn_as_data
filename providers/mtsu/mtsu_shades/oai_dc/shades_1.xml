<dc:description>This landscape view of the Tennessee River at Knoxville is seen from a height in the vicinity of Fort Sanders or the University of Tennessee.  The completed railroad bridge confirms its post-Civil War date. Artist Flavius Fisher, who was born in Virginia and had grown up in East Tennessee, is known to have studied in Philadelphia until about 1850 and was working in Richmond by 1855. He is known to have painted one or more portraits in Knoxville in the 1850s.</dc:description>
