<dc:description>Panoramic view of railroad bridge and encampment outside of Chattanooga. Col. James Whiteside was a Chattanooga industrialist and one of the main supporters of the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad, which was completed in 1854. Barnard was a photographer in the Topographical Branch of the Department of Engineers, Army of the Cumberland, United States Army. He traveled to Nashville, Knoxville, and Chattanooga in 1864. Captain Orlando M. Poe had sent Barnard to Chattanooga in early February 1864 to document the landscape, during which time he focused on railroads, battlefields and on the Lookout Mountain area. The bridge near Whitesides was considered a highly strategic location.  The bridge had been constructed some months prior to this photograph by Federal army engineers. Note the defensive blockhouse in the foreground.</dc:description>
