<dc:title>Brownlow, Susan Photograph by Brady</dc:title>
<dc:description>Portrait of a young woman.</dc:description>
<dc:description>al Note:Susan Brownlow, the daughter of newspaper editor and Unionist William Gannaway "Parson" Brownlow, lived in Knoxville during the war. She is reputed to have defied Confederate soldiers by displaying a United States flag. New York-born Matthew Brady, who took this portrait, studied under painter William Page and later under artist and inventor Samuel F.B. Morse at the National Academy of Design. There, Brady was introduced to the daguerreotype and he soon opened his own photography studio. Brady later became famous for his photographs of the Civil War.
