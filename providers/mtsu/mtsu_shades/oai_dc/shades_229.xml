<dc:date>ca. 1907</dc:date>
<dc:description>This living room scene, which takes place in a house with fireplace located in a wooded setting, shows a young man in gray Confederate uniform clasping the hands of a gray-haired man, while two young women stand behind a seated weeping woman. An African American man and woman stand witnessing the scene, as do two dogs and a cat, while a young African American man stands in the doorway holding a horse by the reins.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Artist Gilbert Gaul, who is known to have been teaching in Nashville about the time this was painted, may have based in people and places that he knew from near his inherited farm in Van Buren County, Tennessee.  Gaul, too young to have served in the Civil War, created  popular genre scenes and battle images, many of which were published as color lithographs. </dc:description>
