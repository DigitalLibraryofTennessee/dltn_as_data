<dc:description>Barnard was a photographer in the Topographical Branch of the Department of Engineers, Army of the Cumberland, United States Army. He traveled to Nashville, Knoxville, and Chattanooga in 1864. During the Civil War, the tomb was located on the grounds of Polk Place, the home where Polk and his wife Sarah Childress Polk retired at the end of his term as President. Polk Place, which was on Capitol Hill, is now gone, and the tomb has been relocated to the grounds of the state capitol.</dc:description>
