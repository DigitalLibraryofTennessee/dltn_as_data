<dc:description>Alexander Simplot, 1837-1914, was a "special artist" who traveled with Union forces from 1861-1863. The painting shows a Union ironclad Monarch, one of five in the battle, in the foreground firing on Confederate Beauregard, which was a remodeled steamboat with cannons on the open-deck. Of the eight Confederate steamboats, all but one was lost. A pencil sketch of this naval battle, also by Simplot, was reproduced as an engraving in Harper's Weekly 28 June 1862.</dc:description>
