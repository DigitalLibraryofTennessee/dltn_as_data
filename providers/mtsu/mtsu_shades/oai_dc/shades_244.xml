<dc:description>Drawing consists of a vignette of a seated man drawing next to a wagon, and two corner sections showing a tent on right and a log fortification on left. A large case on the ground bears the letters "F.G. Gutherz"</dc:description>
<dc:description>During the Civil War, Gutherz served in the First Tennessee Volunteer Regiment, C.S.A as an army engineer. He was with Confederate forces fighting Sherman in North Georgia in 1864. As indicated by the inscription across the bottom, the man at work next to the tent is probably Gutherz himself.</dc:description>
