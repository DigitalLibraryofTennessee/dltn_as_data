<dc:description>Artist Robert Loftin Newman, a Virginian who had a studio in Clarksville, Tennessee in 1858, served in the Confederate Army. In 1864, he designed a flag for the Confederacy, which he sent to Jefferson Davis with a letter on March 12th. After the war, he returned to Tennessee and was living in Nashville by the early 1870s, where he called on other artists and prominent former Confederates to assist in his attempt to establish an Academy of Fine Arts.  He spent his final years in New York City, where he had a major exhibition in 1894 at Knoedler Gallery. He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Clarksville. These beautifully drawn portraits are among Newman's only known Civil War themed works. </dc:description>
