<dc:description>This house was built in 1837 for Leonidas Polk, later known as the "Fighting Bishop" of the Confederacy. Trained at West Point, he entered the ministry and moved with his family to Louisiana in 1841 after his appointment as the Bishop of the Southwest Territory. He sold the house to his younger brother Andrew Jackson Polk whose daughter Antoinette performed a heroic deed during the Civil War by warning Confederate soldiers of an impeding Union troop advance.</dc:description>
