<dc:description>Frank Vizetelly was a British correspondent for the Illustrated London News. He wrote on verso of this image, "Cotton Burners on the border of SW Tennessee and Mississippi surprised by Federal Scouts." Vizetelly described the scene of southern soldiers surprised by Indiana cavalry while destroying bales of cotton as "frightened whites and negroes looked on from the house." The Confederate government had forbidden the sale of cotton to the "enemy" in 1861. In order to prevent their falling into the hands of those who could prosper from its sale, Confederate soldiers sometimes destroyed cotton stores.</dc:description>
