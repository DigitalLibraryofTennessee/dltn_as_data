<dc:description>Colonel John Pope (1794-1865), a prominent Memphis Cotton grower, received a medal for his cotton in 1851 at London's Great Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations, now known as the "Crystal Palace" exposition. He had studied law at Yale University and served in the Alabama state legislature before settling in Tennessee. Pope, who was one of the founders of the Memphis and Charleston Railroad at Bolivar, Tennessee, in 1834, developed some 900 acres of southwestern Tennessee land in the vicinity of Memphis. An innovator and pioneer in the science of farming, he is credited with helping develop short staple cotton as a commodity.</dc:description>
