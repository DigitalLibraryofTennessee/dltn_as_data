<dc:description>Barnard was a photographer in the Topographical Branch of the Department of Engineers, Army of the Cumberland, United States Army. He traveled to Nashville, Knoxville, and Chattanooga in 1864. This bridge across the Holston River was critical to the movement of troops and supplies. It was one of those targeted by the East Tennessee loyalist bridge burners in late 1861. </dc:description>
