<dc:description>The Drummer Boy of Shiloh was a song written for Harpers Weekly magazine by William S. Hays following the Battle of Chickamauga in 1863. The inspiration for drummer boy Johnny Shiloh may have been John Lincoln Clem who served with distinction in the Battle of Chickamauga at the age of 12 and was promoted for his bravery. While it is unlikely that Clem served at Shiloh, many young boys did serve as musicians on the battlefield, leading troops into and out of the fighting.</dc:description>
