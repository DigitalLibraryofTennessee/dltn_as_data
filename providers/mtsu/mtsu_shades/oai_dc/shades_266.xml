<dc:description>The Reverend William Blount Carter, a Presbyterian minister from a prominent East Tennessee family of Unionists, was a graduate of Princeton University. His brother, Samuel P. Carter, a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, was commander of U.S. forces in southeastern Kentucky early in the war, and his brother James was in command of the 2nd Tennessee Volunteer Infantry. Reverend Carter is widely thought to have played a role in encouraging the bridge burnings by Union supporters in upper East Tennessee in November 1861.</dc:description>
