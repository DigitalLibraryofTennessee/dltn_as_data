<dc:description>Studio portrait of a young man standing beside seated middle aged woman. He appears to be about 18-20 years old. On the back of this card is a handwritten poem that begins: "When far in distant lands..."</dc:description>
<dc:description>This formal portrait of Fred G. Gutherz is inscribed on the back "To Dear Mother." Although he is not in uniform, this may have been taken just prior to his leaving for war. Gutherz served in the First Tennessee Volunteer Regiment, C.S.A as an army engineer. He later served with the Confederate forces fighting Sherman in North Georgia in 1864. Fred Gutherz left a number of camp drawings from his time of service. His brother, Carl, too young to serve, became well-known as an artist. He commemorated his feelings about the Civil War in artwork, most of which was created many years later.</dc:description>
