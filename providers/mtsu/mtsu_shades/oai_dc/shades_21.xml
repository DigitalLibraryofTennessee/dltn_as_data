<dc:description>The United States Colored Troops (U.S.C.T.) in Tennessee experienced every facet of war between 1863 and 1865. In the spring of 1863, General Lorenzo Thomas was appointed Commissioner for the Organization of Colored Troops for the Federal Army in Tennessee. He began actively raising black regiments in Memphis and had 3, 000 troops by June. These first regiments were designated by state and race, such as the 1st Tennessee Volunteers Infantry Regiment, A. D. (African Descent). This unit was organized June 27, 1863, at LaGrange, Fayette County.</dc:description>
