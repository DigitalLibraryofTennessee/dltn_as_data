<dc:title>Property Map Showing Location of Early Fisk University Buildings</dc:title>
<dc:date>circa 1867-1873</dc:date>
<dc:description>This street grid and property map shows a plat at upper right, labeled American Missionary Association, on which has been drawn the footprint of an ell-shaped building. Two large properties in the same section bear the name Harding. The streets bounding these blocks are named Salem, Jefferson, Harding, and Hamilton.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This document not only shows the scale and plan of Fisk University's Jubilee Hall, it also shows it in relation to the "ghost" footprint of Fort Gillem, a federal fortification built for the defense of Nashville during the Civil War. Several of the earliest buildings on the campus of the Fisk Free School for African Americans, which was incorporated as Fisk University in 1867, were former army barracks.</dc:description>
