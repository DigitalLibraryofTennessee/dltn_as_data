<dc:title>Longstreet&#8217;s Drum, Found in a Confederate Camp in Blaine</dc:title>
<dc:title>Drum, Confederate</dc:title>
<dc:date>circa 1862</dc:date>
<dc:description>Portable cylindrical drum, covered in brown leather, with tightly stretched leather binding holding the face to the drum body.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This drum was found in a Confederate camp north of Knoxville on the Rutledge Pike. General James Longstreet (1821-1904), a West Point graduate, resigned the United States Army to join the Confederacy under fellow West Point man Robert E. Lee in 1861. After many campaigns east and south, Longstreet contested the Union Army at Knoxville in November 1863. After suffering defeat at the Battle of Fort Sanders, he marched his men north into East Tennessee, where he spent the winter encamped in the vicinity of Russellville.</dc:description>
