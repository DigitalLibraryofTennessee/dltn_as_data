<dc:description>This Protestant Episcopal Church was one of the first established in rural West Tennessee. It was built by slaves of Mrs. Mary Hayes Gloster, a widow from Warrington, N.C.  Traditional lore states that the pews of this church were used to make coffins for Union officers. This area of West Tennessee, which was near the rail lines at Grand Junction, was occupied by Union troops early in the war. In fact, General Grant ordered the establishment of one of the first contraband camps in Tennessee at Grand Junction.</dc:description>
