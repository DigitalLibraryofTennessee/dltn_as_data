<dc:title>Andrew Johnson to Abraham Lincoln and Edwin M. Stanton, Tuesday, September 06, 1864 (Telegram reporting death of John Hunt Morgan)</dc:title>
<dc:title>Morgan, John Hunt, death of</dc:title>
<dc:date>1864-09-06</dc:date>
<dc:description>This telegram was sent by Andrew Johnson, Military Governor of Tennessee, to President Abraham Lincoln and Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, to report the death of Confederate General John Hunt Morgan at Greeneville, Tennessee on 4 September 1864.</dc:description>
<dc:description>General John Hunt Morgan was surprised by federal troops under the command of General Alvin Gillem in an early morning raid on the Dickson-Williams mansion in Greeneville, Tennessee. He was shot  by a Union soldier after being cornered in a vineyard at the edge of the home's formal gardens. The news of the death of Morgan, who had inspired many loyal followers with raids on Union troops in Tennessee and Kentucky, was important enough to merit sending by telegraph--the fastest means of communication during the Civil War.</dc:description>
