<dc:description>This medal was awarded to Dr. Samuel Bond, a Memphis cotton producer, who, along with nine other Americans, including fellow Memphian John Pope, won prize medals in the category of "Vegetable and Animal Substances Chiefly Used in Manufactures" at the 1851 world's industrial fair held at the Crystal Palace in London. A commentary in the official catalogue of the exposition noted that all of the cotton on display came from countries other than Great Britain, and that the English writer hoped that soon "encouragement given to the growth of cotton in our Indian and colonial possessions shall enable us to dispense with the slave-grown cotton of America."
