<dc:description>The Columbia Female Institute was one of Tennessee's most important schools for young women in the antebellum period. It was founded in 1835 by prominent citizens of Columbia, including Episcopal Bishop of Tennessee James Hervey Otey and Reverend Leonidas Polk. One of its early headmasters, Reverend Franklin Gilette Smith, left the school in 1852 to found the rival Columbia Athenaeum.  The Columbia Female Institute closed in 1862 due to the onset of the Civil War and is thought to have served for a time as a federal hospital during the war. It continued in operation until 1932.</dc:description>
