<dc:description>Oval image depicting a banner held by three flying figures against a light sky above a clouded dark landscape in which a uniformed man stands next to a broken wagon wheel and another figure is seated on the ground next to him.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This is the earliest known Civil War-themed work by artist Carl Gutherz whose family moved from Switzerland to Memphis in 1860, when he was 16. It is a mourning picture intended to honor death by showing its memory lifted into heaven. Although Gutherz's brother Fred served in the 154th Senior Volunteer Regiment depicted in the banner, he survived the war. Fred spent time in the Confederate army as an engineer and produced several sketches from his observations. The younger Carl returned to Europe to study in France in the 1870s and 1880s, and made his fame painting large "salon" paintings intended for public viewing. Rather than showing heroic battlefield scenes, these paintings, like this symbolic mourning picture, portray a sense of loss.</dc:description>
