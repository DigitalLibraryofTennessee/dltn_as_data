<dc:description>Adelia Boisseau Warfield and her husband William Wallace Warfield were prominent residents of Clarksville, Tennessee, when artist Robert Loftin Newman opened a studio there in 1858. Newman's large portrait of Adelia and her young daughter, Huldah Belle, is one of a pair painted for these wealthy patrons just prior to the Civil War. Newman was one of the few professional artists in Tennessee to join the Confederate forces. Aside from a post-war pair of portrait drawings of generals Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson and a flag design for the Confederacy, Newman is not known to have created any war-themed works.</dc:description>
