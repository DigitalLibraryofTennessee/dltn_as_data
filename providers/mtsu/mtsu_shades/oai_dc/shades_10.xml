<dc:description>This illustration by "Special Artist" Alfred R. Waud, depicts events occuring at the Battle above the Clouds. On November 25, 1863 Union forces under Generals Sherman, Thomas and Hooker attacked Confederate General Braxton Bragg's troops at Missionary Ridge along Lookout Mountain near Chattanooga.  Sherman was out maneuvered by Confederate General Patrick Cleburne but later support from General Thomas carried the day. Artists like Waud could get closer to the battle than photographers, who were limited by their bulky equipment.</dc:description>
