<dc:title>Belmont Mansion and Formal Garden</dc:title>
<dc:date>ca. 1863</dc:date>
<dc:description>Mansion facing on gardens landscaped in three circular sections with pathways and plantings. One circle surrounds a fountain,  one a gazebo, and the other a flower garden. Four additional gazebos flank the house and grounds.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Architect and engineer Adolphus Heiman oversaw the remodeling and additions to this Italinate house just prior to the Civil War. The formal geometric gardens of Belmont are designed to complement the lines of the home.  Typically, the decorative gardens of a large home were used as an approach in the front of the house, encouraging visitors to admire the building, and functional vegetable, herb and cutting gardens were placed in the rear of the building.</dc:description>
