<dc:description>Ink drawing of the sweep of Tennessee River including Moccasin Bend. Some locations are labeled across the top of the sheet. The labels, left to right, read: Hookers Camps, Raccoon Range, Waldens Ridge, Williams I., Brown's Ferry, Moccasin Point, Chattanooga, Sherman's C (cut off). Barely legible at lower left edge, which is torn, are these words:  "Looki(ng) (Sout)hward Over Lookout Va(lley)."</dc:description>
<dc:description>Although both Theodore Davis and James Walker worked in the Chattanooga and Lookout Mountain area as "Special Artists" for Harpers Weekly and other publications during the war, they also created and published images in the years following. The Point Hotel, for example, which is featured at the far right of the pair to this two-part drawing, was built in May 1888 as the city's incline station.</dc:description>
