<dc:description>Park-like setting in which a stone obelisk topped with a  uniformed soldier stands surrounded by a paved circular walkway, with two flags bearing the Confederate "stars and bars" planted on the lawn on either side of the walkway entrance. Various tombstones and a small mausoleum are also visible in the vicinity.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Confederate Circle at Mt. Olivet Cemetery was created in 1869 as part of a reinterment project designed to honor approximately 1500 Confederate soldiers who died in and around Nashville during the Civil War.  Members of the Ladies Memorial Society purchased a prominent location on a hill within the existing 1855 cemetery. Officials and dignitaries attended the dedication of the new burial ground on 9 May 1869, which was declared the  local "Decoration Day"  in Nashville. The program also encompassed a visit to decorate graves at the old City Cemetery, from which some of the dead were  being transferred.</dc:description>
