<dc:description>Gilbert Gaul, 1855-1919, who received his artistic training at the National Academy of Design, inherited a farm in Van Buren County, Tennessee in 1881. Gaul built a log residence and studio on this land where he lived until 1885. Gaul spent time in Tennessee from 1891 to 1895 and in 1905 began teaching at Watkins Institute in Nashville. In the 1880s, he began to do works commemorating the Civil War, many of which found enthusiastic patrons.</dc:description>
