<dc:description>Union and Confederate veterans of the Civil War began to hold separate reunions as early as the 1870s and by 1890 were organizing joint "Blue and Gray" events.  Much of the impetus for these events was the economic recovery of the war torn country.  Sheet music like Butler's "The Blue and the Gray" was created to support the country's healing process and appeal to the large numbers of veterans of the war.</dc:description>
