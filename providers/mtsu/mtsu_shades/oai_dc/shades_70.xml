<dc:description>Barnard was a photographer in the Topographical Branch of the Department of Engineers, Army of the Cumberland, United States Army. He traveled to Nashville, Knoxville, and Chattanooga in 1864. Chattanooga had been captured by Federal troops in November 1863. Captain Orlando M. Poe sent Barnard to Chattanooga in early February 1864 to photograph railroads, battlefields and the area around Lookout Mountain. He was there for about a week, February 5-12, 1864. The images would be used to create maps and plan for William T. Sherman's Georgia campaign. Barnard's photographs are characterized by a spare elegance.  Note the seated figure at the far right, a device that Barnard frequently employed to suggest scale.</dc:description>
