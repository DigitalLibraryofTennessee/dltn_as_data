<dc:description>In 1888, Thomas Green Ryman commissioned construction of the Union Gospel Tabernacle so that Nashville would have an appropriate venue for the popular evangelical gatherings of the time. A balcony added in 1897, was funded in part by the United Confederate Veterans to accommodate a reunion of their members during the Tennessee Centennial Exposition (Ryman himself never served in the war). The Tabernacle served as their headquarters during the June 1897 three-day reunion and was the starting point for a parade through Nashville. In honor of their support, the Tabernacle's trustees named the addition, "The Confederate Gallery." In 1904, the hall, by then used primarily for concerts and soon to become the first home of the Grand Ole Opry, was re-named the Ryman Auditorium.</dc:description>
