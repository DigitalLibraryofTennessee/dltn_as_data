<dc:title>Portrait of African American Woman and Boy</dc:title>
<dc:date>circa 1865</dc:date>
<dc:description>This formal studio portrait depicts a well-dressed young African American woman seated in a carved wood gothic chair with a boy about 8-10 years old standing to her left and resting his right arm on her shoulder. The woman is fashionably dressed in fitted gown with black ribbon tie at the collar and embroidered bolero-type jacket. The boy wears  a double-breasted wood or cotton homespun suit and collarless white shirt.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This photograph, likely taken in Memphis soon after the Civil War, may depict former a formerly enslaved young woman and her young son. Both wear serious expressions, and she holds what appears to be a bible in her lap. Commissioning a formal portrait like this one represents the transition into a society free from slavery.</dc:description>
