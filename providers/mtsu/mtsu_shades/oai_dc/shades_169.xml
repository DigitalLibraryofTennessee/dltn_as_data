<dc:title>Coverlet, detail</dc:title>
<dc:date>circa 1840s</dc:date>
<dc:description>White on white square cotton coverlet with tufted designs.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This carefully stitched coverlet was made from unbleached cotton. It descended in the family of Mrs. William Winfree, great great grandmother of William Williams Dupree. It is said to have been crafted by one or more slaves, perhaps working as visiting seamstresses on a neighboring cotton plantation. The pattern alternates star and floral shapes with leaves, set into a grid, with geometric cone and curved shapes forming a surrounding motif.</dc:description>
