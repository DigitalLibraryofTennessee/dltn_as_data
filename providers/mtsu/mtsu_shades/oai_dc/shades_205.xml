<dc:description>Adelicia Hayes Franklin Acklen was a widow and the mistress of Belmont Mansion at the time of the Battle of Nashville. At the time this portrait was painted, she was married to her first husband, Isaac Franklin. Upon his death, she became one of the wealthiest women in Tennessee and inherited plantation holdings in Louisiana as well as in and around Nashville. She married Joseph Acklen, a lawyer from Huntsville, in 1849, but was again widowed in 1863. During the Civil War, she remained in Nashville but also managed to successfully oversee valuable cotton interests in Louisiana. The night before the Battle of Nashville, as many as 3000 Union troops were encamped upon the grounds of Belmont Mansion.</dc:description>
