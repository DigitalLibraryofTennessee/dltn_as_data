<dc:description>Author Lucy Virginia Smith French (1825-1881) lived in McMinnville and Beersheba Springs during the period of the Civil War.  We know from her diaries that Mrs. French grew roses, violets (blue and white yellow), verbenas, fuschias, and geraniums. She embroidered this quilt with images of those flowers. The quilt survived the war and was donated to the Tennessee State Museum by her descendants.</dc:description>
