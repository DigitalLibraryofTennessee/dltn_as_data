<dc:title>Athenaeum Rectory, Columbia, Tennessee</dc:title>
<dc:description>Picturesque scene with well-dressed young women in hats and light-colored dresses in seated and standing poses outdoors in front of a vine covered two-story building with a three-arched portico and a fountain in the front yard.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Originally commissioned by a cousin of James K. Polk, the Rectory (completed 1837) became the residence of the Reverend and Mrs. Franklin Gillette Smith after they moved from  Virginia to Columbia, Tennessee so that he could  become headmaster of the Columbia Female Institute. Even though Smith left the Institute in 1851, he and his wife continued to live at the Rectory, which became an essential part of the campus of the his Columbia Athenaeum, founded in 1852. The Athenaeum, which was primarily a boarding school for young women, remained open throughout the Civil War. It continued in operation after Smith's death under the auspices of one of his sons until 1904. This unusual building, with its Venetian Gothic Revival design, has been attributed to Nashville architect/engineer Adolphus Heiman.</dc:description>
