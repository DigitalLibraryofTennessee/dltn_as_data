<dc:date>circa 1890-1895</dc:date>
<dc:description>Cast and stamped round metal disk with the words "Fort Sanders. Its Memory Alone Remains" around the edge and the image of a large bunker with the Stars and Stripes flying above.

<dc:description>This medal, designed to be pinned to the chest, may have been created for the first 1890 Blue and Gray Reunion of Civil War Veterans held in Knoxville. The medal highlights both the jutting fortified wall (called a salient) at Fort Sanders  and the deep trench that trapped Confederate troops attempting to scale the wall. Their heroic efforts and the brilliant strategies of Federal engineer Orlando M. Poe who reinforced and strengthened the fort, are honored in the scene depicted here.</dc:description>
