<dc:title>Fort Sanders, Knoxville, Tennessee</dc:title>
<dc:date>1864</dc:date>
<dc:description>This black and white image depicts a tree-stump studded landscape with trench and ramped earth fortification. A section of wooden railing is visible atop the earth mound at right.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The landscape in the foreground is now thought by scholars to show a portion of Fort Sanders. It was long thought to have been taken by photographer Sam A. Cooley, of Fort McAllister, South Carolina (near Savannah, GA) because the negative was found in a sleeve labeled Fort McAllister. However, since Cooley is not recorded as having been in Tennessee, the photograph has been attributed to George Barnard, who, as chief photographer for the U.S. Army's  topographical engineers, was headquartered in Tennessee in 1863 and 186.</dc:description>
