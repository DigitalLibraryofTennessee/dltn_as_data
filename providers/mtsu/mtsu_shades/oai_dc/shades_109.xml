<dc:description>Antebellum Italian revival house on landscaped grounds, Kingston Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Bleak House, the home of Robert Houston and Louisa Franklin Armstrong, was one of several fashionable houses of wealthy Knoxvillians built just before the Civil War. Armstrong and other prominent Unionists (such as Perez Dickinson and John J. Craig, who also owned homes of a similar Italianate style), left the city in the early years of the war. Louisa Franklin Armstrong remained in Knoxville and her home was used as the headquarters for Confederate generals James Longstreet and Lafayette McLaws during the 1863 "Siege of Knoxville." On November 18, 1863, Union General William P. Sanders was shot and killed, reputedly by sharpshooters located in the tower. Charcoal drawings of the faces of three men, apparently sketched by federal soldiers,  can be found today on the north wall of the tower's interior. Both Confederate and Union veterans visited Bleak House, now a museum called Confederate Memorial Hall, during Civil War reunions.</dc:description>
