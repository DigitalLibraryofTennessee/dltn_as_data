<dc:description>This illustration, by Cincinnati-based artist Henri Lovie, was published in Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper in late 1862. The text that accompanied it notes that the "national government" had formed this camp for men "rescued from slavery" and that "they are employed in labor about the fort...and paid a pro rata for what they do."</dc:description>
