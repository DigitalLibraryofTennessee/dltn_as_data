<dc:description>This drawing shows the formal garden of what is known today as the Hunt-Phelan home. A Greek-Revival  Memphis mansion built in 1835, it was owned by William Hunt, whose wife inherited it from her father, during the Civil War. The gardens, reputedly designed by a French architect, were part of a master plan for the whole property that included the driveway, walking paths, ornamental shrubs, and historic trees. </dc:description>
