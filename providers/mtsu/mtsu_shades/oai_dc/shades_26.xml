<dc:description>Ten-year-old drummer John Lincoln Clem, of Newark, Ohio, became famous as "Johnny Shiloh" after he was reputed to have survived a shrapnel shell during the Battle of Shiloh. While scholars have been unable to place Clem at Shiloh, he did serve at Chickamauga and was wounded in Atlanta. After the war, President Grant appointed him to the regular army, in which he rose to the rank of Colonel, before retiring in 1903.</dc:description>
