<dc:description>Polk Place, on Capitol Hill, was remodeled by President and Mrs. James K. Polk to serve as a retirement residence after he left Washington when his term concluded in 1848.

Sarah Childress Polk resided at Polk Place during the Civil War and continued to live in the home until her death on 14 August 1891.
