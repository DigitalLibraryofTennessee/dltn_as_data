<dc:description>Three story Italianate villa located on a tree-filled hill.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This fashionable house, designed by an unknown architect, was commissioned by John J. Craig, a prominent  businessman originally from Alabama, who was engaged in mercantile and banking activities just  prior to the Civil War. Like several of his Unionist peers, Craig moved away from the city in the early years of the war. With his wife, Knoxvillian Mary Lyon, and their infant son, he relocated to Cincinnati and  later to New York while conflict raged in Tennessee. Another well-known Knoxville Unionist, Oliver P. Temple, purchased the house in 1865 and renamed it Melrose.  After the war, Craig returned to Knoxville and founded one of Tennessee's largest marble companies.</dc:description>
