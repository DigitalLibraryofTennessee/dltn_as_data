<dc:description>This is the far right portion of a panorama, which was taken from a high hill overlooking a river. It shows rural countryside dotted with houses and other buildings, and a sloping landscape descending into what appears to be a creek flowing into the river at center.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Theodore M. Schleier (1832-1908), a photographer born in Prussia, is known to have worked in Nashville during the period from 1859-1869 and in Knoxville during the 1870s and 1880s. In 1862, he married Caroline Knaffl, whose brothers ran a photography studio in Knoxville. Schleier's studio imprint, which indicated studio locations in Nashville, Knoxville, and Chattanooga, can be found on cartes-de-visite produced during the Civil War, including  portrait photographs of officers in the 1st United States Colored Troops Heavy Artillery, which was organized in Knoxville in 1864. This portion of Schleier's Knoxville panorama shows residential areas and buildings located or and near hills sloping down into one of the creeks that feed into the Holston (Tennessee) River just east of the city.</dc:description>
