<dc:description>This painting depicts eight African Americans of varying ages working in a field of corn, probably under a hot June sun. The moment shown appears to be a break for water.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Thomas Waterman Wood, a native of Vermont, trained as an artist in Boston and New York and traveled in Europe before settling in Nashville in 1859. He was drawn to the cosmopolitan southern city by the promise of portrait commissions, but he undertook this genre painting, for which he hired models, on his own. He left Nashville in 1862 for Louisville, Kentucky.  What he had seen of African American life must have fascinated him, for he soon undertook a series of paintings that chronicled the transition from slavery to citizenship.</dc:description>
