<dc:description>This receipt, made out to the University of the South, reflects the purchase of a hand-wrought marble cornerstone from "J. Sloan Steam Marble Works Market Street Nashville Tennessee" on October 15, 1860. Marble dealer James Sloan of Nashville also supplied the East Tennessee marble for the interior of the Tennessee State Capitol.  Two small books carved from the brown variegated marble of the cornerstone, which was destroyed by Union soldiers on July 13, 1863, can also be found in the museum collection of the University of the South.</dc:description>
