<dc:description>This drawing, done by the wife of Joseph A. Mabry during the final months of the Civil War, is inscribed "Home after war, showing fort and ditches"  and bears the date 8 Feb 1865. Mabry, a prominent railroad man, paid to outfit a Confederate regiment at the beginning of the war. However, after Knoxville was returned to Union control, he signed an oath of allegiance to the United States and cooperated with Union officials for the duration of the war.  This drawing depicts the Mabrys' stately country home on a hill in northeast Knoxville, a location that seems to have served as a vantage point for troops on both sides.</dc:description>
