<dc:title>Fort Donelson</dc:title>
<dc:date>circa 1867-1868</dc:date>
<dc:description>Hand-drawn pictorial map depicting part of the fort itself,  the Cumberland River,and the town of Dover. A red line highlights a section labeled "military cemetery." Below it the word "Freestate"  is written and in parenthesis: "camp of contrabands."</dc:description>
<dc:description>This document is one of the very few to identify a location and approximate size for a "contraband camp." Such camps were often found near Union fortifications.  Many African American former slaves and other persons who had escaped through enemy lines sought protection and sometimes employment as Union forces coming into the South. Since Tennessee was in the northernmost portion of the western war theater, some of the earliest contraband camps were established in or around strategic transportation corridors, such as at Dover, at Memphis, and at Grand Junction, an important railroad intersection between Memphis and Corinth, Mississippi.</dc:description>
