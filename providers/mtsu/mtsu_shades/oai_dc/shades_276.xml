<dc:title>Boy soldier</dc:title>
<dc:date>1860-1865</dc:date>
<dc:description>Studio portrait of a boy who appears to be 8-10 years old, with arms crossed,  wearing a loose uniform, boots, a hat with a tilted brim and badge, and a holster with sidearm.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This image is part of a Civil War glass negative collection at the Library of Congress. A number of cartes-de-visite from Morse's Gallery of the Cumberland, a photographic studio in Nashville, have been recorded. Many depict soldiers. The fact that they are both Union and Confederate suggest that the studio continued to operate during the war, even as Nashville changed hands. Even though enlistment age for Union soldiers was eighteen, some younger boys were admitted with parental consent, while others managed to enter the armed forces surreptitiously.</dc:description>
