<dc:description>The "Confederate Rest" section of Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis was established during the Civil War. Former Confederate soldiers continued to be buried there over the decades and "Decoration Day" was celebrated by well-known figures including Jefferson Davis and Nathan Bedford Forrest in the 1870s. Today the section is surrounded by large magnolia trees. </dc:description>
