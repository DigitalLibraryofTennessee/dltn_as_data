The labels, left to right, read:  Raccoon Range, Waldens Ridge, Williams I., Brown's Ferry, Moccasin Point, Chattanooga, Sherman's Crossing, Point Hotel.

<dc:description>Although both Theodore Davis and James Walker worked in the Chattanooga and Lookout Mountain area as "Special Artists" for Harpers Weekly and other publications during the war, they also created and published images in the years following. The Point Hotel, for example, which is featured at the far right of this image, was built in May 1888 as the city's incline station.</dc:description>
