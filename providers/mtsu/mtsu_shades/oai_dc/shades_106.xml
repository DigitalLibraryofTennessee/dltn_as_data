<dc:description>Professional artists dependent upon wealthy patrons risked losing business as a result of partisan attitudes. Some left Tennessee, moving either north or further south to avoid having to take sides publicly.Those who stayed carefully toed the line of neutrality, like painter-photographer George Dury, who painted figures from both sides of the war. The Reconstruction Legislature, also known as the Brownlow Legislature, also commissioned a full-length portrait of Gov. William G. Brownlow from Dury.</dc:description>
