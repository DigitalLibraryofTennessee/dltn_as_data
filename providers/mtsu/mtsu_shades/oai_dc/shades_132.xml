<dc:title>Jewelry, Sarah Childress Polk</dc:title>
<dc:date>circa 1850</dc:date>
<dc:description>Piece of metal jewelry shaped like a ribbon with a buckle closure.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Former First Lady Sarah Childress Polk wore mourning clothes from the time of her husband's death in 1849 until the end of her life. Upon James K. Polk's retirement to Nashville, the former President and his wife had moved into Polk Place, a prominent residence in the vicinity of Capitol Hill in downtown Nashville. After Polk's death, his widow Sarah remained in Nashville.  As the gracious hostess of the formerly grand Polk Place, she was honored by visits from officers on both sides of the conflict. This fancy brooch was a piece of Sarah Polk's jewelry.</dc:description>
