<dc:description>This portrait of Confederate General Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson (1824-1863) has been attributed to artist Robert Loftin Newman, a Virginian who had a studio in Clarksville, Tennessee in 1858. Newman served in the Confederate Army, returning to Tennessee after the war before moving to New York City for the remainder of his life. These are among his only known Civil War themed works. He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Clarksville.</dc:description>
