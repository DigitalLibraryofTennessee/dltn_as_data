<dc:title>Tombstones of Julius and Bertha Levy Ochs</dc:title>
<dc:description>This detail shows base of a granite obelisk with two granite frames laid out in front of it marking the resting places of those buried in the graves below the marker: Julius Ochs (1826-1888) and  Bertha Levy Ochs (1833-1908).</dc:description>
<dc:description>This is the tombstone of the parents of Adolph Ochs, Julius and Bertha Ochs. Julius died in Chattanooga in 1888.  Adolph, who was raised in Knoxville, had experienced life in that divided city during the war. His father Julius served in the Union army,while his mother, Bertha Levy, who had grown up on a plantation in the Deep South, remained loyal to the Confederacy. Their tombstones reveal their conflicting sympathies. His reads: "He loved and bravely served the country of his adoption. He was gifted, cultured, noble and pure. An indulgent father, a model husband, a true philanthropist and a God-fearing man." Hers reads: "A brilliant mind, a pure soul overflowing with love for God, her family, and the South."  While in Chattanooga, Adolph Ochs, a successful newspaper publisher who revived Chattanooga's daily and acquired the New York Times in 1896, was a prominent member of Chattanooga society, participating in some of the South's earliest Blue-Gray reunions and supporting the formation of the Chickamauga-Chattanooga National Battlefied as well as helping to preserve portions of Lookout Mountain.</dc:description>
