<dc:description>Armless rocking chair with split-bottom seat and missing wood in top slat.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This chair was made by Richard Poynor (1802-1882) an African American furniture artisan in Williamson County, Tennessee.  Poynor,  born into slavery, purchased his freedom in the 1850s. A prolific and popular chairmaker, Poynor is best-known for this type of ladderback chair, with its distinctive arched slats.  Seats were usually fashioned from oak splits, rockers from walnut, and chair frames from hickory and maple. This chair, reputed to have been inside the Carter House, in Franklin, Tennessee, during the Battle of Franklin in November 1864,  was apparently damaged by a bullet. The Carter family's son Todd, a Confederate soldier, died in the house from wounds suffered during the same battle.</dc:description>
