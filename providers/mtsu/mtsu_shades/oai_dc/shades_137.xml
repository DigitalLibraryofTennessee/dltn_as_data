<dc:title>Flag Belonging to William Driver</dc:title>
<dc:date>ca. 1865</dc:date>
<dc:description>This photograph shows a woman and a man of older middle age standing in front of a very large United States flag that appears to have been attached to the front of a  building. The building, perhaps their house, has wood siding, a central brick chimney and a white wooden picket fence. The flag has thirteen stripes and  five horizontal rows of stars, as well as a white anchor at lower right.</dc:description>
<dc:description>William Driver, a New England ship captain who had retired to Nashville before the Civil War, was  famous for having called his homemade ship's flag "Old Glory" on one of his legendary voyages. During the early days of the war, Driver hid the oversized flag, which his wife had re-sewn circa 1861 to hold thirty four stars after the admission of Kansas into the Union. Driver became famous once again when Union soldiers raised "Old Glory"over the Tennessee State Capitol to signal the arrival of federal forces on February 25, 1862.</dc:description>
