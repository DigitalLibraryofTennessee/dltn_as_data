<dc:title>Bills Cottage</dc:title>
<dc:title>Cottage at The Pillars</dc:title>
<dc:date>ca. 1863</dc:date>
<dc:description>Small white wooden building with side gable roof, off-center front door topped by a rectangular paneled glass window and shuttered front window.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This white wooden cottage, with carved scrollwork detail below gabled eaves and and gothic arches adorning the square hoods over its single front window and door, was built during the Civil War by John Houston Bills. Bills, a prominent cotton factor, had been a close associate of President James K. Polk. An anti-war Unionist, he built this cottage in the yard adjoining his home, The Pillars, so that his daughter, who was married to Confederate officer Marshall Polk, a relative of James and Sarah Polk's, could move back into town while her husband was away. Sarah Polk's influence assured that Marshall Polk would receive special care and attention after he was wounded during the war. Emmaline and Marshall presented a gold-tipped cane to Sarah Polk in appreciation.</dc:description>
