<dc:date>circa 1882</dc:date>
<dc:description>Two carte-de-visite photographs showing (on left): the head and shoulders of a young man with wispy beard  and (on right): the head and shoulders of an older gentleman with mustache and beard. At the bottom of card on right: "McCrary &amp; Branson, Knoxville, Tenn."</dc:description>
<dc:description>These two men, father and son, died in a shootout on Knoxville's Gay Street on 19 October 1882. Prior to the Civil War, the elder Mabry was a wealthy landowner and founder of the Knoxville &amp; Kentucky Railroad. Even though he paid to outfit a Confederate regiment, once Union troops arrived in Knoxville he moved quickly to guard his business interests and took the Oath of Allegiance to the United States. His 1858 house on a high hill northeast of the city was used by both Confederate and Union soldiers because it commanded good views of the surrounding terrain. The photograph of the senior Mabry bears the name of the Knoxville photography studio McCrary &amp; Branson. Artist Lloyd Branson and partner Frank McCrary operated a studio in Knoxville from the early 1880s to 1903.</dc:description>
