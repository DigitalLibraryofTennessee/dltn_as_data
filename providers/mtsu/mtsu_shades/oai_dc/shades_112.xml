<dc:description>Wessyngton, home of the Washington family, was one of the highest producing tobacco plantations in Tennessee at the time of the Civil War.  The Washingtons also owned a large number of slaves who built their large brick home of bricks made on the property. Many of the Washington slaves left with Union forces as they occupied Tennessee. Some enlisted when a regiment of United States Colored Troops was organized in Gallatin, Tennessee.</dc:description>
