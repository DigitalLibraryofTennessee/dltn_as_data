<dc:description>The Antiquities of Tennessee, 1890, was the first published book on Native American excavations in Middle Tennessee. Author Gates P. Thruston, a former general in the Union Army, who had served under General George Thomas during the Civil War, married into a Nashville family after the war. Thruston, who was active in both the Tennessee Historical Society and the Nashville Art Association in the 1880s and 1890s, had been passionate about archaeology since his youth. He donated his  extensive collection of artifacts excavated in the Middle Tennessee area to Vanderbilt University.</dc:description>
