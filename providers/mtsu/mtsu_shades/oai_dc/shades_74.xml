<dc:description>A massive white crenelated building is guarded by 3 soliders standing at the front door.  There are 5 additional soldiers on the rooftop. Two soldiers stand watch at a side entrance at far right, one of whom wears a coat.  A face peers out of the open window in the center right of the facade. Two saddled horses and a covered wagon with two horses stand beside what appears to be a blockhouse. No vegetation is visible.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This building, used as a Federal hospital during the Civil War, was designed by architect and engineer Adolphus Heiman. The photograph was taken by George N. Barnard, chief photographer of the Topographical Branch of the Department of Engineers for the Army of the Cumberland, somtime during 1864. Barnard had moved his office to 89 Church Street in Nashville in December 1863 and was working under the direction of Orlando M. Poe to document the landscape in preparation for mapmaking but he also took the opportunity to photograph strategic buildings like this hospital, Fort Negely, and the capitol.</dc:description>
