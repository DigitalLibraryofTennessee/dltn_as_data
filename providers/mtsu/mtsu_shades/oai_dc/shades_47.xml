<dc:description>Barnard was a photographer in the Topographical Branch of the Department of Engineers, Army of the Cumberland, United States Army with offices based at 89 Church Street in Nashville beginning in December 1863. Nashville had been captured by Federal troops in February of 1862 and Chattanooga had fallen in November 1863. Barnard traveled to Nashville, Knoxville, and Chattanooga in 1864. His focus in his work was the locations of strategic interest to the military: railroads, bridges and battlefields. Between January and September of 1864 Nashville was the scene of great activity as approximately 140,000 troops and immense amounts of supplies passed through the city as the Federal campaign moved south.</dc:description>
