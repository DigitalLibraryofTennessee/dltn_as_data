<dc:description>This scene was intended to represent Henry Fry and some of the other loyalists in upper East Tennessee who had attempted to burn bridges in order to disrupt Confederate movements in their area. After the November 8, 1861 burning of a bridge on the outskirts of Greeneville, five men, including Fry, were hanged for their participation. Among the group were both Fry and master potter Christopher A. Haun.</dc:description>
