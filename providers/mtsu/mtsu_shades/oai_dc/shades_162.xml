<dc:description>A pencil drawing of a train underway with smoke belching from its locomotive, pulling by a covered platform. There are  three large buildings with smokestacks in the distance, and at right a building with a series of arches and railroad tracks leading inside.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This drawing, by Swiss artist Auguste Burnand, depicts factories and railroad tracks located in the northern section of the City of Knoxville, where the newly-completed East Tennessee &amp; Georgia Railroad into Knoxville and the under-construction East Tennessee &amp; Virginia Railroad had shared depots and connecting tracks. Once the East Tennessee &amp; Georgia Railroad was completed to Knoxville, goods formerly carried downstream by river could move quickly south to the ports of Georgia and South Carolina. After the East Tennessee &amp; Virginia Railroad opened in 1858,  passengers and luxury goods could travel easily to and from cities of the mid-Atlantic by the most direct route north through the Valley of Virginia.</dc:description>
