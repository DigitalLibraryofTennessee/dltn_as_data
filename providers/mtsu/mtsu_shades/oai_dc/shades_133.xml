<dc:description>Capt. James T. Hogane entered the service in August 1861. He was Brigade Engineer 1st District Missouri on staff of Brig. Gen. Thompson ("Co. Sappers &amp; Miners"). He was captured on March 1, 1862, at New Madrid, Missouri, and came to be confined at Johnson's Island. He evidently used his talents to draw maps of the prison for various soldiers, such as James S. Brown. His handiwork is also seen at the front of St. Clair Morgan's Autograph Album in TSLA's Samuel Dold Morgan Papers.</dc:description>
