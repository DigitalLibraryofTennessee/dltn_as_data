<dc:title>Portrait of John McGavock</dc:title>
<dc:date>circa 1848</dc:date>
<dc:description>Portrait of a young, dark-haired man facing forward with his right hand holding the fold of his jacket at chest height. He is wearing a formal white shirt and vest, with dark tie and  coat. The canvas appears to have been cut down at the sides, perhaps to fit a frame other than the original.</dc:description>
<dc:description>John McGavock (1815-1893) was the owner of Carnton Plantation, just outside of Franklin, Tennessee, during the Civil War. His wife, Carrie Winder McGavock (1829-1905), who was present when the house and yard were used as a makeshift hospital after the Battle of Franklin on 30 November 1864, oversaw the burial of as many as 1500 Confederate soldiers in a cemetery on the grounds. </dc:description>
