<dc:description>The 79th New York Highlanders was originally formed as part of the New York State militia. A wood engraving showing the group marching in Scottish parade dress, created by artist Winslow Homer, was published in Harper's Weekly 329 (25 May 1861). They fought in the defense of Knoxville at Campbell's Station and Fort Sanders in November 1863. This image captures a group of veterans in Knoxville for a Civil War reunion. They are apparently standing on the roof of Bleak House. A monument erected in honor of the 79th NY Highlanders, still stands at 16th and Clinch in the Fort Sanders neighborhood of Knoxville.</dc:description>
