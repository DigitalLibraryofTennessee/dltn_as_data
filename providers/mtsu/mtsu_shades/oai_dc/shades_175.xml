<dc:date>cia. 1862</dc:date>
<dc:description>This photograph shows a pair of well-worn brown leather riding boots of medium height, one boot shown on its side with sole visible, the other standing as seen from the rear.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Union officer Colonel John T. Wilder of Indiana was the commander of the "lightning" brigade, whose presence critical to the success of actions around Tullahoma, Chattanooga, and Chickamauga in the summer and fall of 1863. At the conclusion of the war, Wilder was promoted to Brigadier General as a tribute. He parlayed a successful iron business in Chattanooga into a political career and was elected Mayor of Chattanooga in 1871. This pair of boots might well have been ordered by Wilder from a local shoemaker during the course of the war. A post-war claim filed in Hawkins County, Tennessee, by an African American saddler and harness maker listed custom-made boots for Union soldiers as one of the items for which he had been promised payment.</dc:description>
