<dc:description>This cover image for Harper's Weekly issue dated November 16, 1867, drawn by Alfred R. Waud, depicts a line of African American men in the process of voting for the first time in their lives. Even though the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution had abolished slavery in 1865, and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 had granted many rights to the freed slaves, questions and controversies surrounded the act of voting and many African Americans were denied their opportunity until the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment specifically granted them that specific right  in 1868. Artist Thomas Waterman Wood painted many versions of a similar scene beginning in 1868.</dc:description>
