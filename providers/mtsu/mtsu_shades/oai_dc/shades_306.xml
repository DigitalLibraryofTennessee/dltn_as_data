<dc:date>1873</dc:date>
<dc:description>Handwritten documents from the files of the Southern Claims Commission reflecting a claim by Alfred McKinney, a tanyard owner and former slave in Hawkins County, Tennessee, who applied for compensation for a leather saddle and mare taken by federal troops. </dc:description>
<dc:description>This 1873 document is a testimony by Alfred McKinney that was signed by Special Agent John B. Brownlow, who stated that he had no doubt of the loyalty of this claimant.  The file also includes the deposition of John Netherland, a prominent citizen of Hawkins County, who stated that McKinney had offered "every kindness in his power" to the Union men, "furnishing them with shelter, provisions, and shoes and boots and this was done at the risk of his life." The claim was allowed in part in 1874.</dc:description>
