<dc:description>This photograph shows the original company of the Fisk Jubilee Singers. Excelling in popular sacred music, they  toured the United States and Europe raising awareness and money to support Nashville's  Fisk University, one of the earliest Historically Black Colleges. Proceeds from a tour of Europe in 1873-74 paid for the university's first permanent building. The handsome building, named Jubilee Hall, is still standing today.</dc:description>
