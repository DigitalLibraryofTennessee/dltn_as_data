<dc:description>Artist Lloyd Branson, one of the most respected painters of 19th century Knoxville, was commissioned by the Ladies Memorial Association to design this monument. The monument was carved by a former Union soldier. Many Confederate cemeteries and monuments were funded and cared for by women's organizations since federal funds could only be used for national cemeteries.</dc:description>
