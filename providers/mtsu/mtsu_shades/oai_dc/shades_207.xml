<dc:description>William Wallace Warfield was a prominent resident of Clarksville, Tennessee, when artist Robert Loftin Newman opened a studio there in 1858. Newman's large portrait of Warfield and his young son, William Laban, is one of a pair painted for wealthy patrons just prior to the Civil War. Newman was one of the few professional artists in Tennessee to join the Confederate forces. Aside from a post-war pair of portrait drawings of generals Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson, Newman is not known to have created any war-themed works.</dc:description>
