<dc:description>Carl Gutherz (1844-1907) arrived in Memphis at the age of 16 with his family in 1860.  While Carl never served in the Civil War, he found work as a draftsman for a Memphis arms foundry and is reported to have smuggled contraband for the Confederate troops. In 1870, Gutherz studied at the &#201;cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris.  Upon his return to the United States he became an art instructor in St. Louis, helping to establish the St. Louis School and Museum of Fine Arts.  During his second tenure in Paris (1884&#8211;1896) he attended the Acad&#233;mie Julian.</dc:description>
