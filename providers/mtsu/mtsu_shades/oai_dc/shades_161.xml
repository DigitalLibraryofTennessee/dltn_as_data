<dc:description>Photographer George N. Barnard (1819-1902) worked in Matthew Brady's photography studio in New York City and Washington, D.C.  in the early 1860s, which is probably when this  portrait photograph was made. After the outbreak of the Civil War, still under Brady's auspices, Barnard made photographs of battlefields in Virginia and the vicinity of Washington, D.C. He was appointed in late 1863 to oversee photographic operations for the United States Army Topographical Engineers in the Army of the Cumberland, which was headquartered in Nashville. Barnard's photographs of Knoxville and Chattanooga attest to his presence there in 1864.</dc:description>
