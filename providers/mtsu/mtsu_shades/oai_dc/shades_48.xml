<dc:title>Lotz House Fa&#231;ade</dc:title>
<dc:date>1858</dc:date>
<dc:description>Greek revival style, two story wood frame house in Franklin, Tennessee. Decorative carved scroll and floral ornament in pediment and on front support columns.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Lotz designed and built this house, which is located across the street from the brick home of Fountain Branch Carter. Lotz, a skilled carpenter and German immigrant, created furniture for the home interior and for many patrons in the area prior to the Civil War. During the Battle of Franklin, 30 November 1864, Lotz and his family took shelter at the Carter house. His house survived with surprisingly little damage.</dc:description>
