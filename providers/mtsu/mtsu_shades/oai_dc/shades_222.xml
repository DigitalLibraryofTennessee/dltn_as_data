<dc:date>1878</dc:date>
<dc:description>Oval portrait of an elderly woman wearing a stiff white collar, a dark dress with buckle pin and a dark veil of mourning.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This portrait of Sarah Childress Polk (1803-1891) shows her in mourning clothing, which she wore from the time of former President James K. Polk's death in 1848 until the end of her life. The white collar and band on her veil and the brown leather of the distinctive buckle brooch she wears at her neck are the only touches of color in her attire. Sarah Polk remained at Polk Place in Nashville after her husband's death. She was in residence during the Civil War and at the time this portrait was painted by artist George Dury.</dc:description>
