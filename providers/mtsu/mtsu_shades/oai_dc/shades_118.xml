<dc:description>Artist Robert Loftin Newman, originally from Virginia, lived in Clarksville, Tennessee, maintaining a portraiture practice prior to the Civil War. Hoping to serve as a "special artist"  with the Confederate army, he enlisted but was informed that all able-bodied men were needed so he served for a period as a regular soldier. At war's end, Newman opened a studio in Nashville, hoping to make a living teaching students and attracting clients among ex-Confederates. While the studio was apparently short-lived, several related pairs of commemorative portraits of Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson have been attributed to Newman, possibly from this period. For the remainder of his career, he lived and worked in New York City, painting religious and mythological scenes.</dc:description>
