<dc:description>Theodore R. Davis (1840-1894) was a special artist who travelled to the battle front to sketch scenes which were sent back to New York for conversion to engravings for Harper's Weekly. Over the course of the war, Davis travelled around the South and is known to have been in Memphis in 1861; he was present with Union forces at Chattanooga and Lookout Mountain in 1863; and then was in Knoxville as he prepared to travel with Sherman on his march to Atlanta. Over 250 of the sketches he created on site were published in Harpers Weekly. After the war, Davis produced more finished paintings of Civil War scenes and consulted on the cyclorama of Atlanta.
