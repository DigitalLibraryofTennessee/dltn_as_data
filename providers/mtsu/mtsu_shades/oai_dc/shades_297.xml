<dc:description>George Peter Alexander Healy (1813-1894) may have been the best-known portraitist of his era when he painted portraits of President James K. Polk and Sarah Childress Polk at the White House, circa 1845. He was a favorite of Louis-Philippe of France, for whom he had traveled to Tennessee to paint a portrait of former president Andrew Jackson in 1845, which proved to be the last year of his life.</dc:description>
