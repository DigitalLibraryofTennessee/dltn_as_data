<dc:description>Port Royal was an early trading center because of its location at the junction of the Red River and Sulfur 

Fork. The earliest settlers arrived in 1784 and the town, named by the Samuel Wilcox family, incorporated 

in 1797. The first post office was established in 1801. The Port Royal site represents the importance 

of river transportation in early Tennessee history. The Port Royal Historic State Park was established in 1978 to preserve and protect the history of the early river town. The park is also designated as site on the Trail of 

Tears National Historic Trail.</dc:description>
