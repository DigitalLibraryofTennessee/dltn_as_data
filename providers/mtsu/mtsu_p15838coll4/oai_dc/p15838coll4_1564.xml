<dc:description>Brief history of the E.T. Wickham Stone Park and Cemetery</dc:description>
<dc:description>Enoch Tanner Wickham (1883-1970) created a roadside park across from his own concrete and log home that was full of concrete sculpture devoted to famous events and people in American history.  He also created sculptures with powerful religious imagery at his family cemetery in rural Montgomery County. Statues include likenesses of Daniel Boone, Andrew Jackson, Alvin York, and wing-spread angels. Wickham was not discovered as an artist until after his death, but some of his work was featured in the 1982 World's Fair in Knoxville. Some installments were then removed to Austin Peay University. In 2000, the National Endowment of the Arts awarded a grant for a combined effort from Austin Peay Professors and the Custom House Museum in Clarksville to document and interpret Wickham's contributions to Tennessee's self-taught art traditions. This resulted in a major exhibit and catalog about Wickham's sculptures at the Custom House Museum in 2001.</dc:description>
