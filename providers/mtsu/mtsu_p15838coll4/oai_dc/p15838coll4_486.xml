<dc:description>St. Marks Presbyterian church was founded ca. 1875 by Reverend William H. Franklin, also pastor. It is significantly associated with Swift College, an African American institution in Upper East Tennessee from 1883 to the mid-1960s. The church ministered to the faculty, students, and community of Swift. The church dissolved on July 21, 2002.</dc:description>
