<dc:description>The Dyersburg Courthouse Square Historic District, located in Dyer County, Tennessee, consists of the Dyer County Courthouse, the buildings surrounding the courthouse on Court Street, Mill Street, Market Street, and Main Street, as well as the two hundred block and the even numbered side of the three hundred block of West Court Street up to and including Domino's Pizza, and a portion of the two hundred block of South Mill Avenue. There are forty-five contributing buildings and eight non-contributing buildings, most of which were building between 1880 and 1925. The Dyer County Courthouse, constructed in 1911, serves as the focal point for the district. This three-story brick Classical Revival-influenced structure was designed by Asa Biggs. The historic district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.</dc:description>
