<dc:description>Ferguson Hall was constructed from 1852-1853 by Daniel McCaulfin for Martin Cheairs.  Martin Cheairs was the son of a prominent early citizen of the town of Spring Hill, Tennessee,  Nathaniel Francis Cheairs III and brother of Nathaniel Cheairs IV, the owner of Rippavilla.  The Greek Revival style home was part of a large plantation that was used as the Confederate headquarters for General Earl Van Dorn during the Spring of 1863.  A local physician named George B. Peters suspected his wife was having an affair with General Earl Van Dorn.  On May 7, 1863, Peters entered the house and shot the general in the back of the head, killing him.  In 1897, William C. Branham and William Hughes bought the mansion and the 57 acres surrounding it and moved their school, Branham-Hughes Military Academy, to the property.  By the early 1930s, the Great Depression forced the academy to close its doors.  In 1934, the property was deeded over to the Tennessee Orphan's Home.  The name has been changed to the Tennessee Children's Home.</dc:description>
