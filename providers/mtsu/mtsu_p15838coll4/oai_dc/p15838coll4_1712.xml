<dc:description>Hair Conrad's cabin was built around 1804. The log cabin dwelling represents a combination of Native American and European styles. Conrad was a Cherokee and lived in the cabin until the late 1830s when the US government forced Cherokees to move. Conrad served in the army during the War of 1812 and was also a Trail of Tears detachment leader. Hair Conrad served on the National Committee of the Cherokee Nation in 1836 and protested against the Treaty of New Echota. The area surrounding the cabin also has associations with the Trail of Tears. About two miles away is Fort Hill Cemetery which was the site of a Cherokee internment camp.  The current owner has furnished the cabin as an interpretive site.</dc:description>
