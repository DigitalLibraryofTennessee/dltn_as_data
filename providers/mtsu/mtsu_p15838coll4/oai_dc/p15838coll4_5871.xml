<dc:description>Located in Newport, Tennessee, Tanner High School originated from a school for blacks, Summit School, in the community of Jones Hill. Although by 1917 there was a high school for white students in Newport, there were no high schools for black students in the city at this time, and blacks who wished to attend school past the eighth grade had to attend private black normal schools and colleges in other towns. According to local histories, in the early 1920s, as the crowded condition of Summit School was becoming increasingly unbearable, John M. Jones, who was running for mayor, promised the black community a new school in exchange for voting for him in the 1923 election. After he took office, the city passed a $100,000 bond for civil improvements, to be used largely for the construction of a thirteen-room addition to the city&#8217;s white elementary school, and for the construction of a new black elementary school. This school, which would eventually become known as Tanner School, was originally called the &#8220;Newport Consolidated School&#8221; in 1924, and was known by the white community as the &#8220;Newport Colored School.&#8221; The funding for the Newport Consolidated School was largely raised by the community; however, funds were also provided by the Julius Rosenwald Fund (JRF). By December 1930, eighteen black students attended Tanner Training High School and seven of these were bussed in from rural areas in the county. In 1931, the first high school students graduated. The need for additional space was finally fulfilled in October 1947 when the school board funded the Tanner School expansion project. In 1966, integration occurred in Cocke County, and most of the high school students attending Tanner School went to Cocke County High. The last graduating class prior to the integration of schools in Cocke County consisted of three pupils, Deborah Danzie, Jerry Carr, and Alfreda Carr, in 1966. Local histories state that, until its closing in 1966, every black person in Cocke County could trace their academic roots to Tanner School.</dc:description>
