<dc:description>Color photograph of a historic home viewed from the south.  A gazebo stands in the foreground.  Behind it, a sunroom is connected to the main house.  The sunroom  has a central double-door entryway with eight light fixed windows in each door.  Each door has a two-light transom window above it.  Flanking the doors are two 12-light fixed windows with four-light transom windows above them. The main house has two six-over six- double hung sash windows on the first floor with louvered shutters and three six-over-six double hung sash windows.  The window on the left has louvered shutters, while the middle window has none and the window on the right only has one louvered shutter.  You can see the second story veranda on the rear of the house with a brick column supporting it.  A denticulated cornice runs along the periphery of the entire house.  Two large brick chimneys can be seen rising from the hipped roof made of corrugated tin.  The front portico with Corinthian capitals and fluted columns can be seen on the left.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Rippavilla was built by Nathaniel Cheairs IV.  Construction began in 1852 and commenced in 1855.  Rippavilla and its farmland was the location where General John Bell Hood's Confederate troops set up camp in late November of 1864.  The Union Army marched past the Confederates while they were asleep through the night along the Columbia-Franklin Turnpike, what is now known as U.S. Highway 31.  The house remained in the Cheairs family until 1920.</dc:description>
