<dc:description>Brief history of Toles Chapel CME. It describes the origins and location of the church. The entry is excerpted from "Tombstone inscriptions from Black cemeteries in Benton County, Tennessee" by J.K. Smith.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Toles Chapel's first meetinghouse originally sat on the grounds presently occupied by the cemetery on Flatwoods Road. The land was purchased for six dollars in February 1907 by Oliver Toles, George Wyly, and Richard McAuley. The congregation eventually relocated to its current building, a former schoolhouse. Built as a Rosenwald-plan school between 1930 and 1940, Toles Chapel CME is a concrete-block building that sits in a well landscaped lot. Sometime after its construction, a small addition with a gable and shed roof, exterior door, and chimney was attached. The historic cemetery at the rear was a principal burial ground for local African Americans and reportedly contains hundreds of unmarked graves. The cemetery landscape has been altered by the movement and rearrangement of tombstones. At the time of fieldwork, Jerry Howard served as pastor and the property was considered eligible for the National Register.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Toles Chapel C. M. E. The first meetinghouse for this congregation stood on the hill where the old Toles Chapel cemetery is located; in February 1907 the church trustees, OLIVER TOLES, GEORGE WYLY and RICHARD McAULEY, bought for $6 a parcel of land on Flatwoods Road, a point about 50 yards north of the present church on Wren Avenue. Eventually the congregation moved to the block building, a former schoolhouse, it now occupies. Sources: Benton County Deed Book 2, pages 48-49; Mr. Ovell Travis, Camden.</dc:description>
