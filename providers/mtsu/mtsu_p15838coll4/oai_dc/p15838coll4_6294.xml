A double-leaf wood-and-glass  doorway are topped by a two-light transom.  Five one-over-one double hung sash windows are located on the north facade.  Two carved wooden brackets are used to support the overhang of the canted corner. The west elevation of the west wing includes two one-over-one double-hung sash windows and a stone chimney with a corbled top.  A hipped corrugated tin roof sits atop the west wing.  The west elevation of the main building includes three small fixed attic windows.  A tin cornice with dentils caps the main structure.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Columbia Union Station train depot was built from 1902-1905 by the Nashville, Chattanooga, and St. Louis Railway and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad.  It operated as a passenger service depot until 1954 when airline travel became more popular and as a freight depot until 1961, at which time it became unused as a station.  The building served as an apartment complex in the 1970s and 1980s until it fell into disrepair.  It was restored in the early 2010s.</dc:description>
