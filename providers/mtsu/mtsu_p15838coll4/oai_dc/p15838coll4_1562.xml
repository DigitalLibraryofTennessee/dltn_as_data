<dc:description>Built in 1927, The Country Woman's Club is an excellent and intact vernacular craftsman-style log building. Its two rooms are designed to house club meetings and activities. The Club began in 1922 with the women meeting monthly for lunch at one of the member's houses to "provide social enjoyment" with other rural women who did not "have the same privileges as city residents in the social world."  Their first outside-the-home meeting space was the White's Creek Chapel School. The schoolhouse needed work, so the women renovated it to meet their needs. Like the current building the women had a meeting room and a kitchen. Thus began the Country Woman's Club that is still going strong today in Montgomery County. In 1927, the women bought new property on which they raised money and built a new clubhouse. Today, the Club continues to use its building as a gathering place.</dc:description>
