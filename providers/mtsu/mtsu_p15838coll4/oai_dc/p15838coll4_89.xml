<dc:description>Correspondence from Carolyne L. Knight, Director of the Bledsoe Public Library to Dr. Carroll Van West informing him about historic preservation problem at the Dr. Ross House</dc:description>
<dc:description>Pikeville African Methodist Episcopal Church was built ca. 1870 and is believed to be the oldest rural African American Church building in Tennessee. At times during its long history it served multiple congregations. The church building also served as a public school, known as Lincoln Academy, that served the Black population of the Pikeville area until the new Lincoln School opened in 1925 with support of the Rosenwald Fund. From its founding throughout the Jim Crow era, the setting and location of the church
 was significant to its association with African-American ethnic heritage. Laying on the east bank of the Sequatchie River, the church was physically segregated from the remainder of Pikeville. It was next -to-town, but clearly not part of town. The church was still in use at the time of its nomination to the National Register.</dc:description>

Dear  Dr.  West, 
I  am  sending  you  some  additional  information  on 
the  AME  Zion  Methodist  Church  here  in  Pikeville. 
It  includes  a  copy  of  the  deed  and  a  copy  of  a 
speech  given  by  Miss  Robnett  concerning  the  church. 
Thank  you  for  your  advice  on  th~ Dr.  Ross  House. 
The  mantel  will  be  a  problem.  ~apparently was 
moved  from  the  righ t  bedroom  (parlor).  sometime 
in  the  first  part  of  the  century  and  now  we  do 
not  know  what  to  do.  When  the  work  first started 
it was  moved  back  downstairs  ( where  I  think  it 
ori ginally  was  )  and  then  back  wh~re we  found  it. 
The  doors  we  are  thi nking  about  changing  are  antique 
but  not  original  to  the  house.  Those  two  doors  were 
removed  before  we  aquired  the  house.  We  have  not 
removed  any  trees  except  for  those  white  pines  that 
were  planted  during  the  1960's.  They  were  damaging 
the  house  and  the  roots  were  causing  the  fence  to 
come  apart.  I  have  passed  your  letter  along  to  Mr. 
Collier  where  I  hope  it will  do  some  good  about  the 
old  Dr .  Ross  off ice  and  the  1920'  garage. 
Thank  you  for  your  help  on  this  project.  See  you  in 
october. 
Sincerely, 
Carolyne  L .  Knight
