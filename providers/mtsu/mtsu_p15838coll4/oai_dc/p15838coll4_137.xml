<dc:description>The congregation of Fredonia Baptist Church date to 1867. The church was officially founded when two Baptist ministers, Reverends Hardin Smith and Henry Owen, began organizing the men and women in erecting a place of worship in 1869. In 1899, this frame building was destroyed by fire and another was built in 1900. During the 1950s, the congregation supported and held meetings for the Golden Life Insurance Company. Reverend Archie Hardaway reorganized the congregation and created a Trustee Board in 1955 to support and supervise the construction a modern building. Its dedication was in 1957.</dc:description>
