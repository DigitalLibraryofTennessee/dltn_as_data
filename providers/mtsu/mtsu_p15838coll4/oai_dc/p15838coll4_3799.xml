<dc:description>Field notes of Galilee Primitive Baptist Church. The notes illustrate the location of Galilee PB in relation to the First Baptist Church and Sevier Street. [Although the street number "809" was added to the address, the site of the former church building seems to be 917 Sevier Street.]</dc:description>
<dc:description>Galilee Primitive Baptist Church's current building replaced an earlier church dating from 1940. The previous building was a concrete-block, gable-front church. At the time of fieldwork, Robert S. Evenson served as pastor and the church was deemed potentially eligible for the National Register.</dc:description>
