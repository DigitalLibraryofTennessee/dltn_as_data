<dc:description>The object of the 1863 campaigns was to gain control of the city of Chattanooga, a city of great strategic importance to both the North and the South. Chattanooga was considered the gateway to the Deep South, and Union strategists considered the control of the city essential to successfully launching an invasion into the heart of the Confederacy.  Chattanooga is located on the south bank of the Tennessee River and is encircled by Missionary Ridge, Lookout Mountain, Raccoon Mountain, and Walden&#8217;s Ridge. This difficult terrain would pose a challenge for both armies and would play a significant role in determining the strategy and outcome of the fighting.</dc:description>
