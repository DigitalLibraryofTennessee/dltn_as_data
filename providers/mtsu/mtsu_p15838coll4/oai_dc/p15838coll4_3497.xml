<dc:description>First Baptist Colored Church (now First Baptist Church) was formally established in 1866 as the first black Baptist church in Selma.  During Reconstruction other churches formed across the city of Selma but First Baptist maintained its leadership. In 1871 and 1872 state black Baptist conventions took place at the church, acknowledging its role not only locally but in the general Baptist movement in Alabama. A large brick church building was constructed in 1894 in northeast Selma.  The church served as an important strategy center and meeting place for the Civil Rights Movement in Selma in the  early 1960s. In 1965 it was a staging ground for the Selma to Montgomery March led by Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., with support from the Southern Christian Leadership Council (SCLC) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC).</dc:description>
