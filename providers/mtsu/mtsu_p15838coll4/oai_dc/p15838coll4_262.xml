<dc:description>Barrs Chapel was founded on land donated for the purpose by John Barr, ca. 1864. The church and the associated school became the center of an African-American community after the Civil War as black landowners developed farms around the site. The cemetery was established ca. 1870. The church building standing on site as of 2005 was constructed in 1953 in the same location as previous buildings constructed ca. 1864, 1900 and 1933. The school was in operation by 1906 and remodeled in the 1930s, possibly through the Works Progress Administration. It was closed in 1958 when Henry County created a central segregated school. The school at Barrs Chapel was then used as a community center.</dc:description>
