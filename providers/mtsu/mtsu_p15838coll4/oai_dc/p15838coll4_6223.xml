<dc:description>This building was the first permanent structure that served the city of Spring Hill, Tennessee and its surrounding communities as a high school.  The building was built as part of the Works Progress Administration under Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal between 1936-1937.  The north end of the building added two classrooms in 1945 and four classrooms were added to the south end of the building in 1949.  A tornado did some damage to the building in 1963.  In 1965, eight more classrooms were added to the north end.  The school saw integration come in 1966 with the addition of 36 African-American students.  A cafeteria was included in 1970.  The school closed after the 1991-92 school year when a new building was built to accommodate an increase in the population of Spring Hill.</dc:description>
