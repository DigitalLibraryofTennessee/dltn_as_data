<dc:description>Mt. Lebanon Baptist Church has Reconstruction era roots, dating back to its construction in 1869. The original frame building was replaced with a brick structure in 1954. At the time of documentation (May 15, 1998), the church was situated within a black neighborhood south of downtown Camden. Larry C. Jackson served as pastor at that time and the church. </dc:description>
