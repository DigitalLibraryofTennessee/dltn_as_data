<dc:description>An essay by Bertah R. Quarles on the history of the Warfield Elementary School, associated with Guildfield Baptist Church; titled "History of the Warfield Elementary School Guthrie, KY. 1922-1968."</dc:description>
<dc:description>The congregation that became Guildfield Missionary Baptist Church dates to meetings 1868 held at the South Guthrie home of Isaac Saile.  It formally organized in 1869 under the auspices of the Consolidated American Missionary Baptist Convention. Reverend C.W. Ware served as pastor until 1882. The name Guildfield came from a suggestion by a deacon's wife, Mrs. William Saile.  There are no other Guildfield African American churches in Tennessee. There were several buildings at the site until the 1890s when a new frame building was built. The frame building served as meeting place until the present church was constructed in 1922. A small middle-class of black professionals developed in South Guthrie, but the black community was still small and, in general, poor.  The money raised for the new building is largely credited to the work of Rev. Paul D. Dennis and Edward B. Warfield. Warfield was also responsible for the construction of a two-story Rosenwald school, also built in 1922.  It was nicknamed the "Warfield School." Rev. T.E. Winston, minister of the church 1934-1977, made many improvements on the building, including finishing the ground floor of the building and large open room for community gatherings, installation of modern restrooms and a kitchen, and the installation of new stained glass windows in the facade (1967). He also installed storm doors and central heat and air system in 1970. Rev. William Barker Kirby took the leadership of the church in 1985.</dc:description>
