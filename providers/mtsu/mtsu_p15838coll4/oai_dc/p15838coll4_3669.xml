<dc:description>A color photograph of the front of the Cheekwood mansion, part of a large estate that belonged to the Cheek family of Nashville. The view is from the southwest, looking up toward the building. Details of stonework that form the drive up to the house can be seen in the foreground, along with an ornate street lamp of wrought iron. The house is of Georgian Revival style, constructed of stone, with two main floors and a lower level. Built as a private residence, the building serves as a fine arts museum within the grounds of a large botanic garden.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Cheekwood was designed by leading American landscape architect Bryant Fleming between 1929 and 1932. Although the estate was converted into a botanical garden and art museum beginning in 1959, the property boundaries contain the most significant elements of Fleming's original design, including the mansion and surrounding landscape features.</dc:description>
