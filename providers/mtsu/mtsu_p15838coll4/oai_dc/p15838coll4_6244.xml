<dc:description>The RCA Victor Studios Building was built in 1964-65 along Nashville's Music Row by W.B. Cambron and Company at the urging of Chet Atkins and brothers Owen and Harold Bradley.  Studio A, inside the building, is a large rectangle that is virtually intact from it's original construction date.  The room measures 75' x 45' x 25' and is three stories high.  A control room abuts the studio.  Several musicians, including The Monkees, Joe Cocker, Leon Russell, Waylon Jennings, Dolly Parton, Tony Bennett, George Strait, The Beach Boys, William Shatner, George Jones, Jewel, and Willie Nelson, have recorded at the studio.</dc:description>
