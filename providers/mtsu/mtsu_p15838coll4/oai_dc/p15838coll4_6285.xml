<dc:description>Color photograph of the east elevation of Green Street Baptist Church, photographer facing slightly south of east. Griffin Avenue is visible on the right side of the image, along with a row of telephone polls and wires south of the street. The intersection of Griffin Avenue and Green Street is partially visible, with a red and yellow fire hydrant, the tail end of a light blue convertible with a tan top, and a red-painted brick house with barred windows and a hip roof. The church's 1962 brick two-story education wing is visible in this image. Directly above it are parts of the original church building. The edge of the south-gable end, as well as the east-facing gable, which is where the wing was attached to the original structure. The gable ends are topped by concrete and have small pedestals at the peak. The metal-domed ocatagonal cupola is also visible, as are two of the arched louvered windows on each face. The north elevation is partly visible at a sharp angle. The east elevation of the education wing includes six windows on the upper floor and six on the lower floor, arranged asymmetrically. Moving south to north, the first five windows on the upper level are six-light wood windows with cement sills. The sixth window is a one-over-one wood window with a concrete sill. Moving south to north again, the lower level includes one six-light wood window, four ten-light windows with the bottom four lights painted white, and a six light window, each with a concrete sill. Two gutter pipes extend from the white-painted eaves below the flat roof to the ground, one after the first set of windows, the other after the third. A metal ventilation pipe extends up from the north end of the building, and floodlights are mounted to the corners below the eaves. A small shrub grows against the southeast corner of the building. Two air conditioning units are situated in front of the fifth window on the lower level, with utility boxes fastened to the wall and surrounded by a black metal fence. A gravel drive extends in front of this elevation to the parking lot on the south side. The angle of the image also offers a partial view of the east elevation of the northeast tower, which has a a pyramid bonnet asphalt shingle roof, brick corbels extending below the eave and brick pilasters. The visible portion also includes a pair of arched louvered windows with concrete sills. Moving to the north elevation, the three-bay facade of the education wing is visible, divided by brick pilasters. The easternmost bay includes a six-light window on each floor with a concrete sill. The central bay includes a window on the upper floor and a hip roof asphalt shingle awning extending over a door on the lower level. The awning is supported by white-painted wood brackets. Part of a sign is visible between the upper and lower levels. The westernmost bay includes a six-light window on the upper floor and a ten-light window on the lower floor, each with a concrete sill. On the original church building, the north elevation of the northeast tower includes brick corbels and pilasters, with small arched windows on the upper floor and larger arched windows with concrete keystones and imposts on the middle and lowest levels. The bowed wall of the north-facing gable end is visible, with brick corbeling and pilasters. In the central bay, three arched windows sit below the peak of the facade, with four arched windows with concrete keystones and imposts above four rectangular windows, all with concrete sills. The outer bays each include an arched window with a concrete keystone, imposts, and sill above a rectangular window with a concrete lintel and sill. The foundation is painted white. The north-facing gable protrudes slightly a few feet closer to the street than the towers or education wing. There is a partial view of the northwest belltower, which features a pyramid-shaped, asphalt-single bonnet roof capped by a large metal cross. Below it, there is a partial view of two arched openings on the north elevation and brick corbels.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The congregation of Green Street Baptist Church formed in 1881, primarily from the congregation of First Baptist Church (Colored), which was then known as the St. Phillip Street Baptist Church (due to their location). The church was led by Reverend John Blevins, who had been pastor at St. Phillip Street, thus the church was originally known as &#8220;The John Blevins Church.&#8221; He remained there for two or three years. On December 31, 1881, church trustees Jefferson Richardson, Joseph Baylock, Adam Clayton, and Henry Lamar purchased a lot on the corner of Green Street and McCreary Avenue (now Griffin Avenue) for $150. The first worship services were held in a store on the corner.  The first church the congregation built was a small frame building on a lot adjacent to where the brick church now stands. The frame church was small and uncomfortable, unable to accommodate the congregation of 200 souls (with 300 attending Sunday School). The interior of the original structure was lit by three lanterns hanging from the ceiling and a tin lamp on each side wall. The minister had a small platform to stand on, and the children sat on the edge. The original frame building was replaced once by a larger frame church, and again by a brick church, which was dedicated in 1892. The current building was dedicated in 1922. The plan for the building came to Pastor James A. Martin in a dream, and it was designed and built by contractor A.J. Farley. It is a Romanesque Revival church with Italianate influences. Between 1937 and 1946, the church building was renovated and restrooms added. Between 1946 and 1958, the church was renovated again, including the purchase of new pews and floor coverings, and a paved sidewalk was added around the church. In 1946, the church opened a kindergarten, which operated for 14 years. In 1962, the church added an education wing. The late 1980s saw another interior renovation, accompanied by a new roof and renovated restrooms. In the late 1990s, a truss in the church&#8217;s roof failed, which has led to significant damage to the structure, including the bowing of the sanctuary wall on Griffin Avenue, the holes in the roof, and extensive interior damage from exposure to the elements. The remaining congregation currently worships in the education wing.  Green Street&#8217;s current state belies its historical significance. During the 1960s, the church enjoyed a thriving congregation, and its kitchen was used to prepare meals for marchers in the Selma to Montgomery March in 1965. The considerable space in both the education wing and the main sanctuary were also used to provide temporary housing for civil rights workers. On June 5, 1964, the church hosted a mass meeting featuring Ralph Abernathy of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Following the meeting, someone threw a rock at some of the deputized possemen who had surrounded the church during the meeting. The possemen responded by attacking the crowd as it tried to exit the church, using night sticks and tear gas. The riot continued in the neighborhood, injuring many of the black residents and putting some in the hospital. Homes up to a block and a half away from the church were damaged, with broken windows and porch lights. Two white journalists were targeted and their cameras destroyed by possemen.
