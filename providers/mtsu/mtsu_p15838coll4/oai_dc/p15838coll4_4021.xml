<dc:description>The Zion Methodist Church of Rockford has roots in the late nineteenth century when Reverend Jim Rogers served as pastor. At that time, church members regularly congregated in a log building until a fire destroyed it. The land upon which the present-day church sits was purchased for thirty-nine dollars on September 5, 1887. Although the church had acquired land, they were financially unable to afford the construction of a new church building. In order to have a place of worship, the congregation entered into an agreement with Blount County Quarterly Court. In exchange for allowing an elementary school to be erected on the land, the church gained access to the facility for services.  By May 1912, a new building was in use. This building was improved in 1941 with the addition of electric lighting, choir areas, kitchen, and dining hall. Further renovations, including restrooms and brick veneering, occurred in the 1960s and 1970s. According to the fieldnotes, the current building includes two sections based on age: a 1948 remodeled section and a 1982 addition.</dc:description>
