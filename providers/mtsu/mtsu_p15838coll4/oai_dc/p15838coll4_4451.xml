Although unidentified, the building is believed to be the Newport School established in 1941 that was located beside the current church.</dc:description>
<dc:description>In the early 1850s, Chestnut Grove Free Will Baptist Church was part of the Tennessee River Association of Free Will Baptist Churches. By 1869, the white membership of the church had broken away to form the Rock Springs Free Will Baptist Church. Chestnut Grove retained its African American population and joined the Cairo Quarterly Meeting in 1884. Little has been written about the early years of the church. The 1870 Census notes that Reverend Thomas Jones served as preacher. Oral tradition holds that the original location of the church was known as "Old Field,"and that the congregation met in a log building on Charlie Edmondson's property in the early 1900s. The church ultimately moved near its present location on Old Metal Road in Charlotte. The current building dates to 1955. In 1963, at the time of the Newport School's closing, the church acquired the adjacent property. According to one history, Chestnut Grove possesses the distinction of being the only remaining Free Will Baptist church in Dickson County with an African American membership.</dc:description>
