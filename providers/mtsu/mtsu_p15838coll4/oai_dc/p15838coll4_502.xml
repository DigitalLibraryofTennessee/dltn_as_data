<dc:description>The WMS Transmission Complex was built in 1932. The "diamond" tower allowed the radio station as one of the nation's federally designated clear channels to broadcast to forty states a program of music, news, and public service geared to largely a rural and small town audience.  It was one of the original stations that served a military/civil defense role  in the CONELRAD system during the Cold War era,  beginning 1951. The tower  is the tallest Blaw-Knox Diamond Radio Tower in North America, one of six similarly designed to have once existed in North America. It stands at 808 feet. Originally constructed at 878 feet in 1932, it was lowered by 70 feet in 1939 to improve radio transmission and reception. It was third of four of its kind in the world. The WSM Tower is the oldest surviving intact example of this type of radio tower in the world. Colonial Revival design by Russell Hart, of the locally prominent architectural firm of Hart, Freeland, Roberts.</dc:description>
