<dc:description>Color photograph of the north-facing fa&#231;ade of Lannie&#8217;s Bar-B-Q Spot, photographer facing south. The brick fa&#231;ade has three bays. The center and left bay each have a large plate glass window with white wood trim, and the right bay has a pair of glass and metal double doors. Four evenly spaced light fixtures (a large white globe light on the right, light bulbs only on the other three) sit just below a row of vertically laid bricks. A tall beige metal fascia runs the length of the fa&#231;ade, up to the shed roof that slopes up away from the fa&#231;ade. A white metal gutter runs along the edge of the roof, and the spout descends the east end of the fa&#231;ade. A creosote-treated pole on the east end of the building supports the electric and phone lines coming into the restaurant, and a 1990s metal and plastic sign with the Pepsi logo and a cartoon pig reads LANNIE&#8217;S BAR-B-Q SPOT. Two red newspaper vending machines sit in front of the building beside the sign. The parking area in front of the building is concrete. A white-painted, gable-end, concrete block building (part of the restaurant building) is visible to the east. The plate glass windows on the fa&#231;ade are hung with white blinds, and the lighted letter board menu is visible through the windows. The front of a black SUV is visible parked in front of the doors.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Lannie&#8217;s Bar-B-Q Spot has been in business since the 1940s. Named after the original owner, Lannie Travis, and has remained in the (now Hatcher) family. Located in East Selma, it served both black and white patrons throughout its tenure, including during the civil rights activities of the 1960s, when it was neutral ground. Lannie Travis provided sandwiches for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) workers. The current building is from about 1950, but the restaurant has operated on the site since it first opened.</dc:description>
