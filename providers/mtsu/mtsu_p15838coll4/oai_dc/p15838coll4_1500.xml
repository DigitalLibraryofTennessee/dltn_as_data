<dc:description>The McKenzie Depot was built along the Nashville-Chattanooga tracks as a passenger station for the Nashville, Chattanooga, and St. Louis Railway  (N.C.&amp;St.L.).  Built circa 1926 to replace an earlier building, it is a good example of Renaissance Revival architecture and also illustrates the practice, common at the time, of providing separate waiting rooms for black travelers and white travelers. McKenzie Depot combined both waiting rooms in a single building, separated by the ticket office. The small town depot was designed to accommodate growing needs for railroad transportation at the time. The town of McKenzie was organized and platted in 1865 along the railroad tracks. The last passenger train stopped in the town in 1970.</dc:description>
