<dc:description>Color photograph of a historic home viewed from the east.  The east elevation is asymmetrical in its bay layout.  In this photograph, a small portion of a portico can be seen on the left on the first floor.  The house was extended and the second story was added.  The brick work is noticeably different above the portico and to the right of the first window from the left.  The original brickwork is in the Flemish bond style and the extended brickwork is made in the American bond style.  The three windows on the first floor are all six-over-six double-hung windows.  A small doorway with an iron storm door with small steps is also in the first floor.  A basement hatch door is just left of center in the photograph.  The second floor has four six-over-six double-hung windows and one four-over-four double-hung window.  A brick chimney extends above the gabled, corrugated tin roof.  A cornice with dentils extends around the length of the house.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Oaklawn was built in 1835 for Absalom Thompson.  The original structure was built in a Federal style, ell-shaped and one-and-a-half stories high.  The home was rebuilt in 1860 in the Greek Revival style and enlarged to two full stories.  The home served as headquarters for Confederate General John Bell Hood during the Battle of Spring Hill in November of 1864.  This is the infamous location where General Hood slept while Union forces marched past his troops toward Franklin, TN.  the house stayed in the Thompson family until 1911.  The interior was renovated to become a tenant house and suffered from decay.  In the 1940s, the building was returned to its original condition.  The rear portico was enclosed in the 1950s.  The exterior remains much the same as it did when it was remodeled in 1860.  The building served as the home for country and western performers George Jones and Tammy Wynette during the early 1970s.  The building is now privately owned.</dc:description>
