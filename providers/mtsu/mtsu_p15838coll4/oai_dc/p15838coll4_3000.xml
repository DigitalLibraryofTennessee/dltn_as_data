<dc:description>History of the Sam Houston Schoolhouse. The text is largely derived from an entry in the Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This log schoolhouse built near Maryville c.1794 represents a period in Appalachian history when Cherokees and the newly arrived white settlers lived and worked in adjacent communities.  Initially constructed by Andrew Kennedy and Henry McCulloch  the building is most closely associated with Sam Houston, who was the teacher for the little schoolhouse from approximately 1811 until he enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1813.  This site has long been recognized as a significant artifact of the old southwest frontier and is one of the few 18th century structures left in the region. The schoolhouse belongs to the State of Tennessee and is operated as a museum.</dc:description>
