<dc:description>For over two hundred years, Cumberland Gap has served as a significant passageway to the lands west of the Appalachian mountains. The Cumberland Gap Historic District is significant as evidence to the patterns of Claiborne County's history as a late nineteenth and early twentieth century mining town funded by foreign capitalists as well as its associations with Wilderness Road.
