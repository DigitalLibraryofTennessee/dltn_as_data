<dc:description>Color photograph of a partial image of the south elevation, photographer facing north. A telephone wire is visible across the upper left hand corner of the image. More wires extend from an unseen source to an electrical box on the second floor of the education wing. On the left side of the image, a nose of silver sedan is visible beyond a chain link fence. The intersection of Green Street and Griffin Avenue is partly visible, including the top of a stop sign obscured by a boxwood. The back of the opposing stop sign is visible across the intersection. Beyond the intersection, portions of three houses are visible. The first two are L-shaped folk Victorians with gable ends facing the street. The first has a brown asphalt shingle roof with a metal awning on the porch roof that fills in the ell. Another metal awning protects the double window on the gable end. The house is clad in white vinyl siding. The second house has a red metal roof and is clad in light gray (possibly asbestos shingles). It includes a opening beneath the gable peak, and the porch inside the ell has a hip roof. Both the porch and the gable end windows feature metal awnings. The third house has a gray metal roof and a porch and is clad in cream-colored weatherboard. The south elevation of the church dominates the photo. It features a central gable end flanked by a 1962 gable end addition on the east end and a side view of the west-facing gable end facade on the west side, which includes a tower and a single-story addition. Beyond the tower on the southwest corner, the roof of the northwest corner belltower is visible. It is a pyramid-shaped bonnet asphalt shingle roof with a large cross at the peak. A portion of the brickwork supporting is visible just below the roof, as is the very top of one of the open arches that house the bell. The side of the gable-end roof is visible in front of the northwest tower, and a hole and other damage can be seen. The southwest tower includes a pyramid-shaped bonnet roof clad in asphalt shingles with a spike at the top. The south and east elevations of the tower are visible in the image. The east elevation is plain. The south elevation features brick corbels and brick pilasters descending down the sides. Two arched, stained glass windows sit directly below the corbels. Each includes a concrete keystone, sill, and impost, and they share the central impost. The lower portion of the tower is obscured by the one-story addition. to the east of the tower, a portion of white eave with gutter runs along the bottom of the gable roof, with a white gutter extending down from the roof to the roof of the one-story addition. Another pair of arched stained glass windows sit below the eave, which obscures the top of the keystone. The stained glass window on the east end is obscured by a brick chimney in the foreground. The south elevation of the one-story addition (c1937-1946) includes a white-painted eave below a flat roof. The addition is brick, the lower portion is common bond, the upper portion is stretcher bond. Two brick pilaster extend from the lower portion to the roof. A white-trimmed square access point is built into the addition at ground level. The main feature of the south elevation is a wide, arched stained glass window featuring concrete keystone, imposts, and sill with a quadruple row of headers. The window itself is divided into three large sections and framed in white wood. To the east end, a brick chimney moves up the addition before angling toward the gable end of the original structure and climbing vertically clear of the roof. The gable end dominates this view. The edge of the roof is concrete and the peak includes a pedestal. The ends of the gables flare out flat, though the one on the east end has been partially removed to allow the education wing to butt directly up to the original structure. Below the roofline, a series of stepped brick corbels give the impression of a brick bargeboard. Split brick pilasters divide the gable end into three bays, and another set of split pilasters marks the end of the gable end. The central bay includes three arched, louvered windows just below the peak, each with a triple row of headers and a concrete sill. The main section features four arched stained-glass windows with concrete keystones, sills, and imposts. The center windows share imposts. Directly below are four more three-light stained glass windows with concrete lintels and sills. The flanking bays each feature an arched, stained-glass window with a concrete keystone, imposts, and sill over a three-light stained glass window with a concrete lintel and sill. On the top row, the imposts force the split pilaster back to a single before expanding to a double below the imposts. The brickwork on the upper portion is stretcher bond, and the lower portion is common bond. The east end of the image shows a portion of the 1962 education wing. The wing is entirely stretcher bond brick, and the windows have concrete sills. Nearest the original building, utility boxes and conduit travel the height of the two-story wing. A white wooden eave is visible, with a pair of floodlights mounted to it. A louvered vent sits just below the roofline. A six-light window is visible on the second floor, and a portion of a ten-light window is visible on the lower level. The foreground of the image is the concrete-paved parking lot. Chainlink fence surrounds an area in front of the gable end, enclosing air conditioning units, a traffic cone, some discarded cardboard boxes, conduit and a flowerpot.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The congregation of Green Street Baptist Church formed in 1881, primarily from the congregation of First Baptist Church (Colored), which was then known as the St. Phillip Street Baptist Church (due to their location). The church was led by Reverend John Blevins, who had been pastor at St. Phillip Street, thus the church was originally known as &#8220;The John Blevins Church.&#8221; He remained there for two or three years. On December 31, 1881, church trustees Jefferson Richardson, Joseph Baylock, Adam Clayton, and Henry Lamar purchased a lot on the corner of Green Street and McCreary Avenue (now Griffin Avenue) for $150. The first worship services were held in a store on the corner.  The first church the congregation built was a small frame building on a lot adjacent to wear the brick church now stands. The frame church was small and uncomfortable, unable to accommodate the congregation of 200 souls (with 300 attending Sunday School). The interior of the original structure was lit by three lanterns hanging from the ceiling and a tin lamp on each side wall. The minister had a small platform to stand on, and the children sat on the edge. The original frame building was replaced once by a larger frame church, and again by a brick church, which was dedicated in 1892. The current building was dedicated in 1922. The plan for the building came to Pastor James A. Martin in a dream, and it was designed and built by contractor A.J. Farley. It is a Romanesque Revival church with Italianate influences. Between 1937 and 1946, the church building was renovated and restrooms added. Between 1946 and 1958, the church was renovated again, including the purchase of new pews and floor coverings, and a paved sidewalk was added around the church. In 1946, the church opened a kindergarten, which operated for 14 years. In 1962, the church added an education wing. The late 1980s saw another interior renovation, accompanied by a new roof and renovated restrooms. In the late 1990s, a truss in the church&#8217;s roof failed, which has led to significant damage to the structure, including the bowing of the sanctuary wall on Griffin Avenue, the holes in the roof, and extensive interior damage from exposure to the elements. The remaining congregation currently worships in the education wing.  Green Street&#8217;s current state belies its historical significance. During the 1960s, the church enjoyed a thriving congregation, and its kitchen was used to prepare meals for marchers in the Selma to Montgomery March in 1965. The considerable space in both the education wing and the main sanctuary were also used to provide temporary housing for civil rights workers. On June 5, 1964, the church hosted a mass meeting featuring Ralph Abernathy of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Following the meeting, someone threw a rock at some of the deputized possemen who had surrounded the church during the meeting. The possemen responded by attacking the crowd as it tried to exit the church, using night sticks and tear gas. The riot continued in the neighborhood, injuring many of the black residents and putting some in the hospital. Homes up to a block and a half away from the church were damaged, with broken windows and porch lights. Two white journalists were targeted and their cameras destroyed by possemen.
