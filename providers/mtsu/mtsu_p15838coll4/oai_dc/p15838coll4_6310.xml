<dc:description>Color photograph of the west end of the south elevation of Northern Heights Presbyterian Church. This section of the church includes offices and community gathering space. These sections of the building are red brick with the same asphalt-shingle roof as the rest of the building. There are two south-facing gable end additions. On the right side of the image, the south elevation of the main sanctuary is visible with a large stained glass window and red brick pilasters. The first gable-end section is a single story projecting to the south and includes one large stained glass window on its east elevation and four double-hung wood windows on its south elevation. A two-story gable-end addition sits directly to the north of the first gable-end section. The two story addition features six openings divided in the three bays. The two bays on the north end include double-hung wood windows on the first and second floors, and the southernmost bay includes a double-hung wood window on the second floor and a single-leaf white door on the first floor accessed by two concrete steps. A window-unit air conditioner is perched on the middle window on the first floor. White vinyl siding covers the small sections where the two story gable end section meets the single story gable end section and where the body of the main sanctuary meets the first gable end section. A chain-link fence extends from the first gable end addition to form a fenced yard around the rear of the building. Another chain link fence protects the air conditioning unit. There are shrubs in front of the air conditioning unit and at the corner created where the first gable end section meets the main sanctuary section. There are a number of pipes traveling vertically alongside the gable end of the first section. </dc:description>
<dc:description>The congregation of Northern Heights Presbyterian Church formed in 1900 at the Sylvan Street Presbyterian Church under the Reverend Lucius Deyampert. Deyampert left the church to become a missionary to the Congo under William H. Sheppard, an African American missionary who would later become known for his activism opposing to the treatment of the Congolese by rubber companies. The Sylvan Street Presbyterian Church was the second black Presbyterian Church established in Alabama. The congregation grew through the first half of the twentieth century, and moved to the Northern Heights building in June 1960. This building was originally the Northside Baptist Church. The Sylvan Street Church, located at Sylvan Street (now Martin Luther King Street) and Philpot Avenue, is still extant, though in very poor condition. Like many churches at that time, Northern Heights had an active congregation and hosted many volunteer activities for women and children. The church also operated a kindergarten and low-level elementary school, as did many other black churches. Later, starting in the 1970s, the church operated a daycare center for low-income families for fourteen years. Northern Heights is affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA).
