<dc:description>Third Avenue Baptist, named for its street address, is a congregation located in Huntingdon, Tennessee. Golden Eagle Lodge 110, a Masonic chapter housed down the street, built the current church in 1953. Located in a rural community, Third Avenue Baptist Church sits adjacent to railroad tracks. A concrete-block building is located next to the church. At the time of fieldwork, the small building operated as a black beauty parlor. Reverend Troy Cox served as pastor of the church at that time.</dc:description>
