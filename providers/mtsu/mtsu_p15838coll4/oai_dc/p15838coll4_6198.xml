<dc:description>Color photograph of a historic church built in the vernacular eclectic style of architecture viewed from the northwest.  The church has a foundation of cut stone.  The roof features three steeply pitched gables with pediments under each gable.  The eaves are decorated with turned and chamfered brackets.  The front facade features three bays with dual entryways and a centered multi-paned stained glass window.  Each doorway is double-leafed with a stained glass transom light above.  The north elevation features four bays on the original structure.  Two one-over-one double hung windows help light the vestibules that lead from the doorway to the sanctuary.  Two smaller stained glass windows flank a larger stained glass window.  A small gable with pediment is over the central large stained glass window.  </dc:description>
