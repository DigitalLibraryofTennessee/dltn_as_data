<dc:description>The Craigs Chapel AME Zion Church is an example of Jim Crow era communities in which churches had different but related buildings, structures, and sites existing on either the church lot or on immediately adjacent lots. Craigs Chapel has included three critical elements of African American communities, church, cemetery and school. The church was constructed in 1896 and the original school three years later. The church expanded its service to the African American community with the incorporation of the cemetery in 1903. An original school building was physically connected to the church after construction of WPA schools for both whites and blacks in Loudon County c. 1940.</dc:description>
