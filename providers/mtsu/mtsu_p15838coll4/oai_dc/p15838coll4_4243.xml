<dc:description>The Koonce St. Church of Christ is a rural African American church in Alamo, Tennessee. At the time of fieldwork, it appeared that the building had recently been converted into a church. The building consists of three section: a 1995 front addition and two historic houses attached to the rear. Reverend Howard Bond served as the pastor at the time of fieldwork. Described as an "extremely poor building" in 1998, the church showed significant improvement on its exterior in a recent Google satellite image.</dc:description>
