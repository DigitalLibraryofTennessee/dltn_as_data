<dc:description>History and property description of First Ebenezer Baptist Church. The document was developed to support nomination to the National Register of Historic Places.</dc:description>
<dc:description>First Ebenezer Baptist Church was established by Reverend W.H. Perry in 1941. It is significant  for associations with the Civil Rights Movement in Birmingham, from 1956 to 1965, and for its associations with African-American ethnic identity in the Smithfield neighborhood of Birmingham. A comparatively small church, the middle-class congregation is associated with the urban boom in Birmingham brought about by the increases in steel production during World War II. Although the building was too small to host regular meetings of the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights, the Reverend John F. Hardy often held strategy meetings at the church with his congregation and other neighborhood residents.</dc:description>
