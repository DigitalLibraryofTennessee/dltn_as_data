<dc:description>Color photograph of the east elevation of Lannie&#8217;s Bar-B-Q Spot in Selma, photographer facing west. Three distinct section of the Lannie&#8217;s building are visible in this image. The north end, a brick and metal structure with a shed roof that includes the retail space, a middle section that is a gable-roofed brick extension from the rear of the retail space, and a gable-roofed concrete block addition attached to the brick extension on its east side and extending south, creating an ell next to the retail space. The retail section is brick with a metal fascia extending up to the shed roof, which slopes down toward the fa&#231;ade. A white metal gutter runs along the roof to a downspout on the northeast corner of the building. The brick extension has an asphalt shingle north-south running gable roof. A large round metal vent or exhaust fan sits at the peak of the roof, with a metal pipe vent visible just south of it. The concrete block extension has a north-south running metal gable roof. The gable end is clad in white-painted plank or vinyl, and the concrete block structure is painted white. Two or three white PVC pipes run from the base of the concrete block extension into the brick extension inside the ell space. A pole with a security light sits at the northeast corner of the concrete block extension. A creosote-treated pole with an arm to support a sign sits at the northeast corner of the retail space. A metal-framed plastic sign hangs from the arm and includes the Pepsi logo and name in blue. The lower portion of the sign reads LANNIE&#8217;S BAR-B-Q SPOT on the left in blue and feature a cartoon pig in a chef&#8217;s hat serving a ham in red. A red newspaper vending machine is partially visible in front of the fa&#231;ade near the east end. A concrete pad offers parking across the front of the store and about half the depth of the retail space. The area inside the ell is grassy, and a gravel driveway runs across the foreground of the image. Two houses are partly visible on the right side of the image, across the street. Two cars are parked out front, a black SUV in the background and a 1991 Nissan Axxess minivan in the foreground. Mature trees are visible over Lannie&#8217;s roofline and in the neighborhood.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Lannie&#8217;s Bar-B-Q Spot has been in business since the 1940s. Named after the original owner, Lannie Travis, and has remained in the (now Hatcher) family. Located in East Selma, it served both black and white patrons throughout its tenure, including during the civil rights activities of the 1960s, when it was neutral ground. Lannie Travis provided sandwiches for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) workers. The current building is from about 1950, but the restaurant has operated on the site since it first opened.</dc:description>
