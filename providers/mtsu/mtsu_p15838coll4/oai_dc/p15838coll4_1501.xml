<dc:description>Built in 1917, Charleston United Methodist Church was constructed to serve an expanding Methodist community in Tipton County and replace a previous church in poor condition. James McFerrin, an early circuit rider, established the church in Charleston in 1833. The first multi-denominational meetinghouse was probably a log cabin built at about the same time . The second church was built in 1849 and the third around 1876. The associated cemetery may predate the oldest religious building known for the site. It includes approximately 300 gravesites, with the earliest identifiable date of 1836.</dc:description>
