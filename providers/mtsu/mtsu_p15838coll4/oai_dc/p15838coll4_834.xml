<dc:description>Photographic copy of a composite photograph of the Dayton High School graduating class of 1951. Nine African American students and three faculty are pictured. A motto in center reads "As the Labor; so the Reward". Students who completed the educational level at Lincoln School were able to attend the Rhea County black high school in Dayton.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Built 1925-26, the Lincoln School was a public school for African Americans and the only school built in Bledsoe County with funding from the Rosenwald Fund. It followed the four-teacher school plan specified by the Foundation. The Rosenwald program emphasized self-help and industrial education and the well-equipped school offered a new educational experience to area children. Lincoln School was the only school for African American children in Pikeville until 1965, following the court-ordered end to segregated facilities.</dc:description>
