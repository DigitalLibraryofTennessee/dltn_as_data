<dc:description>Color photograph of the east facade of the church.  The sanctuary level has nine tall metal-framed windows, with the six in the center taller. All feature painted glass in a brown-blue-brown pattern. The basement level has seven standard double-hung windows. The east facade is less ornate than the east because of damage done in the 1962 bombing. A one-story addition to church, built c. 1950 is to the left (south) end of the building.</dc:description>
<dc:description>St. Luke AME Zion Church, dating to 1930, was one of the leading Birmingham churches involved in the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights (ACMHR) in the Civil Rights era. Rev. John 0 . Hart, the church's minister from 1960-63, gave spiritual and financial support to Birmingham's Civil Rights struggle, including making the church available for meetings. St. Luke was one of three churches bombed on Jan. 16, 1962. The church was an important strategy center for the Movement in the Project C demonstrations, which were nonviolent confrontational actions intended to provoke response.</dc:description>
