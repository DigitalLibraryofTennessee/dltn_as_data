<dc:description>Oak Street Baptist Church, organized in 1916, is significant for its involvement in the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights.  The church was an important strategy center and source of activism in the Collegeville neighborhood, which was the center of the ACMHR movement in the city. Strategy meetings about participation in the Project C demonstrations as well as voter registration methods took place at the church from 1963 to 1965. In 1965, the church became home to the  Collegeville Neighborhood Association, which was a significant local institution in implementing the Civil Rights Movement in Birmingham in the mid-1970s.</dc:description>
