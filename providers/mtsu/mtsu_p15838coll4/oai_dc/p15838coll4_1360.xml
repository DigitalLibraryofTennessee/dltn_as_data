<dc:description>Brief history of Christ Temple AME Zion Church compiled by Rev. Josephine Bryson and Bob Jarrigan and provided in support of nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. The document discusses the relocation of the church and congregation in 1935, and lists church leadership through the years.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Christ Temple AME church congregation originally gathered and constructed a church building in 1888. The church was rededicated in 1912 by Rev. G.W. Rose as Christ Temple AME Zion. In 1935, it and two other African American congregations were displaced to make room for a New Deal-funded segregated white public school. The school board first bought the property of an existing Missionary Baptist Church, which they traded to Christ Temple AME Zion for their location. Although relocated to a new part of town, and with an overall decrease in population, Christ Temple AME Zion continued to play an important role for African American religious and social life. It held homecomings, revivals, and quarterly conferences. It was also part of an AME Zion circuit. In the new location, Christ Temple AME Zion expanded its outreach, establishing a Women's Day program, a Missionary program, and hosting a District program. By the beginning of the twenty-first century, the congregation dwindled to five women. The church closed regular operation in 2002 and became an annex of Belmont AME Zion Church.</dc:description>
