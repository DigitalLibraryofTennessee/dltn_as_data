<dc:description>Color photograph of church front and side view. Frame building with portico and vinyl siding dates to the 1980s. Gable-roofed portico shelters the entranceway's doubledoors. A wood wheelchair ramp is located to the right of the portico. Two windows flanking the portico appear on the church's facade. Side of church contains four narrow windows. Building sits atop a concrete-block foundation. An elevated porch is visible at the rear of the church. A steeple juts from the ridge of the gable roof. To the right of the new building is the former church building. This concrete-block building contains a tin roof. A metal frame sign, located next to the new building's portico, reads "Williams Grove Baptist Church; Pastor Rev. Carvene Jameson."</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Williams Groves Baptist congregation was established in 1950 and first gathered in a schoolhouse. Around 1958, Williams Grove Baptist relocated to a concrete-block building, circa 1940-1950.  In the 1980s, a frame building, located adjacent to the concrete-block building, took over as the church's sanctuary. Another architectural evolution occurred when vinyl siding was added. At the time of fieldwork, the two churches were not believed to be eligible for the National Register and Rev. Carvene Jameson served as the pastor. Williams Grove Cemetery is nestled on a gravel drive about a third of mile beyond the current church. Consistent with the age of the congregation, the cemetery's earliest burial dates to 1938.</dc:description>
