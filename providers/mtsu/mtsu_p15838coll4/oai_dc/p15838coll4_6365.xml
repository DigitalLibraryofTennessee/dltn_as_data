<dc:description>The Dayton Rosenwald School was built with support of the Julius Rosenwald Fund.  The local community also contributed to the school's funding.  The Fisk Rosenwald database lists one of the first budget years as 1928-29. As a seven-teacher type school, it was one of the larger Rosenwald schools built. </dc:description>
