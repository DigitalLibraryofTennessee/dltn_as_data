<dc:description>Color photograph of the rear addition to Lannie&#8217;s Bar-B-Q Spot, north and east elevations, photographer facing south of west. This building is a white-painted, rectangular concrete-block structure with a north-south seamed, metal gable roof. It is attached to the main structure on the west side, and the brick structure is partly visible in this image. The gable end includes white planks or siding. The east elevation has four openings. The northernmost opening is a single-leaf door (open in the image), and the other three bays are one-over-one windows. A vent on a pipe runs up from the roof between the two middle windows, and the roof is stained with rust below the pipe. A 1990s model GMC two-door pickup truck sits in front of the building. A pole with a security light sits at the northeast corner. Another pole supports wires entering the building on the southeast end. A gravel drive and parking area occupies the foreground of the image, and a grassy strip runs between the drive and the building itself. The windows are blocked on the inside by flattened cardboard boxes.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Lannie&#8217;s Bar-B-Q Spot has been in business since the 1940s. Named after the original owner, Lannie Travis, and has remained in the (now Hatcher) family. Located in East Selma, it served both black and white patrons throughout its tenure, including during the civil rights activities of the 1960s, when it was neutral ground. Lannie Travis provided sandwiches for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) workers. The current building is from about 1950, but the restaurant has operated on the site since it first opened.</dc:description>
