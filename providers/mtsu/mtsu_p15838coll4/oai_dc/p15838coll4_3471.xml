<dc:description>First Baptist Church in the East Thomas neighborhood of Birmingham was organized in 1938 and the Gothic-style brick church with twin towers was constructed the following year. The church supported the Alabama Christian Movement for Civil Rights (AMCHR) during the civile rights era by hosting mass meetings and serving as a strategy center. It also participated in the 1963 Project C demonstration, during which the Reverend J.A. Hayes and other prominent ministers were arrested for violating a city ordinance and a court injunction against street demonstrations. This case developed into the landmark Supreme Court ruling of Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham (1969).</dc:description>
