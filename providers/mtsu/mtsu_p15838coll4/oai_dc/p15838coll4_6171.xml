<dc:description>Color photograph of a board and batten wooden church constructed in the Carpenter Gothic style, viewed from the east.  The church is built upon a gentle slope along Highway 31 with a sidewalk leading up to a small set of steps.  The steps interrupt a rock wall that borders the property on two sides.  A wrought iron fence and gate separate the sidewalk and the church property.  Two red doors, a chimney, two stained glass windows are visible.  The lower window was added in 1888.  The gabled end of the sanctuary has a steeple attached to it with a cross sitting atop.  The steeple has a belfry inside with a bell built in 1839.</dc:description>

Williamson in the Carpenter Gothic style along the Main Street in Spring Hill at a cost of $1800.00, funded by members of the church and friends from the community.  </dc:description>
