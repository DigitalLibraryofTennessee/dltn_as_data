<dc:description>Color photograph of a house in the Greek Revival style of architecture viewed from the north.  The five bay facade has a central entryway on both the first and second floors.  The wooden double-leafed doors have identical transom lights and side lights and are flanked by one full-length pilaster and one-half pilaster that extends from the pediment to the top of the casing of a first floor window.   The first floor has three six-over-six double-hung sash windows while the second floor has two six-over-six double-hung sash windows. A portico with four wooden columns topped with cast iron capitals in the Ionic style support a simple pediment.  A denticulated cornice wraps the entire building. A balcony with a rail extends from the second floor entryway. A simple brick chimney rises out of a low, hipped roof.  </dc:description>
<dc:description>Ferguson Hall was constructed from 1852-1853 by Daniel McCaulfin for Martin Cheairs.  Martin Cheairs was the son of Nathaniel Francis Cheairs III, a prominent early citizen of the town of Spring Hill, and brother of Nathaniel Cheairs IV, the owner of Rippavilla.  The Greek Revival style home was part of a large plantation that was used as the Confederate headquarters for General Earl Van Dorn during the Spring of 1863.  A local physician named George B. Peters suspected his wife was having an affair with General Earl Van Dorn.  On May 7, 1863, Peters entered the house and shot the general in the back of the head, killing him.  In 1897, William C. Branham and William Hughes bought the mansion and the 57 acres surrounding it and moved their school, Branham-Hughes Military Academy, to the property.  By the early 1930s, the Great Depression forced the academy to close its doors.  In 1934, the property was deeded over to the Tennessee Orphan's Home, and later became known as the Tennessee Children's Home.</dc:description>
