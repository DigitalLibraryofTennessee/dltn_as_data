<dc:description>Color photograph of the east-facing facade of Northern Heights Presbyterian Church at the corner of Marie Foster Street and Philpot Avenue. The facade is a buff-brick gable end topped by a steeple. An asphalt-shingle awning bisects the facade horizontally. A pair of white double doors (replacements) serve as the main entrance. These doors are flanked on either side by two windows made of vertically stacked glass bricks. Two square brick columns support the awning on either side of the door, and their bases form brick planters that extend to the edge of the facade. There is a glass brick cross centered above the awning. Boxwoods are planted in front of the planters. The church is surrounded by a small grass lawn leading to sidewalks along the paved roads. The church is situated in a residential area, surrounded by private houses. A chain guard protects the corner of the lawn at Marie Foster and Philpot.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The congregation of Northern Heights Presbyterian Church formed in 1900 at the Sylvan Street Presbyterian Church under the Reverend Lucius Deyampert. Deyampert left the church to become a missionary to the Congo under William H. Sheppard, an African American missionary who would later become known for his activism opposing to the treatment of the Congolese by rubber companies. The Sylvan Street Presbyterian Church was the second black Presbyterian Church established in Alabama. The congregation grew through the first half of the twentieth century, and moved to the Northern Heights building in June 1960. This building was originally the Northside Baptist Church. The Sylvan Street Church, located at Sylvan Street (now Martin Luther King Street) and Philpot Avenue, is still extant, though in very poor condition. Like many churches at that time, Northern Heights had an active congregation and hosted many volunteer activities for women and children. The church also operated a kindergarten and low-level elementary school, as did many other black churches. Later, starting in the 1970s, the church operated a daycare center for low-income families for fourteen years. Northern Heights is affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA). </dc:description>
