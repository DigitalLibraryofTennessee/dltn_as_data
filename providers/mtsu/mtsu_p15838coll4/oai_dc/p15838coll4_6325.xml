<dc:description>Color photograph of the south section of the sanctuary of Green Street Baptist Church. Photographer facing southeast. The image shows the gable end of the back of the sanctuary. The gable end wall includes five stained glass windows on the lower level with five more on the upper level, though these are obscured by the balcony. The balcony is painted white and includes paneling with a brass rail on top, and white painted supports extend from the balcony to the ceiling. A round metal column supports the balcony on the east side. A metal number four is affixed to the center of the balcony's lower edge. The entire space includes thick crown moulding, all painted white, as are the walls. The east wall, formerly an exterior wall, includes two arched stained glass windows on the upper level, though these are not lit as they back to the 1962 education wing. Another opening appears to connect the balcony to the education wing. There are three round glass light fixtures hanging by chains from the underside of the balcony, and one hanging from the ceiling. A white-painted ceiling fan on a long pole hangs from the roof down over the the lower level. The lower level's east wall includes white-painted beadboard wainscoting with a chair rail. An air conditioning duct, painted white, runs under the the balcony along the east wall, and descends down. Just above the edge of the balcony, a portion of air duct is visible with a vent in the southeast corner. The lower level is occupied by several rows of cushioned wood pews, covered in teal fabric. Some of the pews are covered by plastic sheeting to protect them from water damage, as the roof of the building is in extremely poor condition. Water damage is visible on the underside of the balcony near the photographer, and a piece of broken wood sits on one of the pews.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The congregation of Green Street Baptist Church formed in 1881, primarily from the congregation of First Baptist Church (Colored), which was then known as the St. Phillip Street Baptist Church (due to their location). The church was led by Reverend John Blevins, who had been pastor at St. Phillip Street, thus the church was originally known as &#8220;The John Blevins Church.&#8221; He remained there for two or three years. On December 31, 1881, church trustees Jefferson Richardson, Joseph Baylock, Adam Clayton, and Henry Lamar purchased a lot on the corner of Green Street and McCreary Avenue (now Griffin Avenue) for $150. The first worship services were held in a store on the corner.  The first church the congregation built was a small frame building on a lot adjacent to wear the brick church now stands. The frame church was small and uncomfortable, unable to accommodate the congregation of 200 souls (with 300 attending Sunday School). The interior of the original structure was lit by three lanterns hanging from the ceiling and a tin lamp on each side wall. The minister had a small platform to stand on, and the children sat on the edge. The original frame building was replaced once by a larger frame church, and again by a brick church, which was dedicated in 1892. The current building was dedicated in 1922. The plan for the building came to Pastor James A. Martin in a dream, and it was designed and built by contractor A.J. Farley. It is a Romanesque Revival church with Italianate influences. Between 1937 and 1946, the church building was renovated and restrooms added. Between 1946 and 1958, the church was renovated again, including the purchase of new pews and floor coverings, and a paved sidewalk was added around the church. In 1946, the church opened a kindergarten, which operated for 14 years. In 1962, the church added an education wing. The late 1980s saw another interior renovation, accompanied by a new roof and renovated restrooms. In the late 1990s, a truss in the church&#8217;s roof failed, which has led to significant damage to the structure, including the bowing of the sanctuary wall on Griffin Avenue, the holes in the roof, and extensive interior damage from exposure to the elements. The remaining congregation currently worships in the education wing.  Green Street&#8217;s current state belies its historical significance. During the 1960s, the church enjoyed a thriving congregation, and its kitchen was used to prepare meals for marchers in the Selma to Montgomery March in 1965. The considerable space in both the education wing and the main sanctuary were also used to provide temporary housing for civil rights workers. On June 5, 1964, the church hosted a mass meeting featuring Ralph Abernathy of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Following the meeting, someone threw a rock at some of the deputized possemen who had surrounded the church during the meeting. The possemen responded by attacking the crowd as it tried to exit the church, using night sticks and tear gas. The riot continued in the neighborhood, injuring many of the black residents and putting some in the hospital. Homes up to a block and a half away from the church were damaged, with broken windows and porch lights. Two white journalists were targeted and their cameras destroyed by possemen.
