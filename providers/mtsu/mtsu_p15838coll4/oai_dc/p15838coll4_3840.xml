<dc:description>Established around 1879 as Moore Chapel Colored Methodist Episcopal Church, later renamed Friendship Christian Methodist Episcopal, the church is believed to be one of Benton County&#8217;s oldest churches. A small cemetery affiliated with the church, known as Moore Chapel-Flatwoods Cemetery, was established ca. 1881. The original church building stood on the same site occupied by the current building. After the original building started to deteriorate, the congregation used a school building owned by Moore&#8217;s Chapel Methodist Church. Friendship CME later acquired one acre of land to construct a new church building and cemetery on the original site, completing the building in 1989.   Reverends Geneva Cherry and J.E. Robinson served as pastors at the time the property was investigated.</dc:description>
