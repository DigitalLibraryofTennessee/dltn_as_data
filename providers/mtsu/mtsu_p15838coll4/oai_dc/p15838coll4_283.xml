<dc:description>St. Paul African Methodist Episcopal Church was founded in 1824 on a small plot of land purchased for $15.00. The church was moved to progressively more suitable locations in 1867 and 1876. The present church stands adjacent to Rose Hill Cemetery, which was dedicated in 1870. The church building was remodeled in 1913 and 1986 and 1992. Notable among the many preachers who served the church was Dr. E.L. Hickman, who preached throughout the Thirteenth Episcopal District before serving as Bishop of the A.M.E. Church from 1956 to 1976.</dc:description>
