<dc:description>Correspondence  from Richard G. Tune, Deputy State Historic Preservation Officer to Mattie McHollin, secretary of Williamson Chapel informing her of Williamson Chapel's placement on the National and Tennessee Registers of Historic Places</dc:description>
<dc:description>Williamson Chapel was founded in 1850 on the plantation of Richard Mastman as Williamson Chapel Methodist Church, forming an anchor for the Needmore community of free blacks near Old Hickory, TN. The name derives from Richard Williamson, a black preacher. The congregation left the Methodist Episcopal Church South in 1876 to join the new Colored Methodist Episcopal Church. The original church building was a log structure, which was relaced in the 1890s with a frame building. A lodge hall was built next to the church for the Knights of Pythias in 1920 also served as a school until Needmore Elementary School was opened in1936. A modern church building was constructed in 2005.</dc:description>
