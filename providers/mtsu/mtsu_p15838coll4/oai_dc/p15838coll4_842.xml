<dc:description>The Rucker-Mason farm is the site of the Rucker House, built ca. 1802-04, which is comprised of a two-story brick home of the I-house design and in the Federal style that is connected to a cedar log structure at the rear. A Greek Revival portico was added at a later date. The house retains its original brick exterior, including a Georgian cornice, brick lintel window treatments and brickwork in the Flemish Bond style. Numerous changes have been done to the buildings in the modern era but the buildings retain many features of early settlers' homes in the region. The house sits on land first acquired by Gideon Rucker, who purchased land warrants from Revolutionary War settlers, and then sold to Gideon's brother Bennett. The land passed to his daughter, Miriam, who married Henry Goodloe. Descendents of the Goodloes still owned the land at the time of fieldwork.</dc:description>
