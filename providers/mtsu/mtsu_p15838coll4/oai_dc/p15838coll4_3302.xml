<dc:description>Color photograph of the cornerstone for Tabernacle Baptist Church. The engraved text reads "Tabernacle Baptist Church. A.D. 1922. D.V. Jemison, Pastor.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Tabernacle Missionary Baptist was established in 1885 as a church for students at the Alabama Baptist Normal and Theological School, later Selma University. The current church building was designed by African American architect David T. West and  constructed in 1922 as a two-story Classical Revival brick building.  Tabernacle Missionary Baptist is nationally significant due to its multiple associations with the Civil Rights Movement in Selma from 1922 to 1968 and for its statewide significance to African American Baptist history, especially the ministry of Rev. D. V. Jemison, who is associated with the expansion and development of the African American Baptist Church and served as president of the National Baptist Convention, USA.  </dc:description>
