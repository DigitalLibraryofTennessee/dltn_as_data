<dc:description>The post-emancipation community of Promise Land was established in the Reconstruction Era by former slaves in Charlotte, Tennessee. The Promise Land Community, as it came to be known as, was the earliest African American settlement in Dickson County. Some settlers found employment at the local ironworks, the Cumberland Furnace. A majority of the residents owned land and labored as independent farmers. Based on deed records and census reports, the first families included that of Nathan Bowen, Washington Vanleer, and the Nesbitt brothers, John and Arch. The community eventually grew to encompass almost two square miles. The built environment in the Promise Land Community consisted of a school, two churches, about fifty houses, and many stores.  By the mid-twentieth century, Promise Land no longer thrived and only a few families remained on the land. Only St. John Promise Land Church and the former Promise Land School building, which was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007, still stand. A Civil Wars Trails marker was erected in July of 2010. According to the marker, the descendants of the original landowners continue to own most of the land. In order to preserve and carry on the legacy of the community, the Promise Land Community Club was organized in 1988.</dc:description>
