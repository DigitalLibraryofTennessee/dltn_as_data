<dc:description>Color photograph of a historic home with kitchen and smokehouse viewed from the southeast.  The kitchen and smokehouse structure is in the foreground.  The structure has seven bays on the south elevation and two doorways on the first floor and one six-over-six double hung sash window on the second story of the east elevation.  The seven bays on the south elevation are all six-over-six double hung sash windows.  Five of these windows feature louvered shutters while two have no shutters at all.  A large brick smokestack and two smaller chimneys can be seen rising from the roof.  The main brick house can be seen in the background with two chimneys and a veranda on the second story of the rear of the house.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Rippavilla was built by Nathaniel Cheairs IV.  Construction began in 1852 and commenced in 1855.  Rippavilla and its farmland was the location where General John Bell Hood's Confederate troops set up camp in late November of 1864.  The Union Army marched past the Confederates while they were asleep through the night along the Columbia-Franklin Turnpike, what is now known as U.S. Highway 31.  The house remained in the Cheairs family until 1920.</dc:description>
