<dc:description> The history of St.Paul AME Church in Alcoa, TN dates to 1910, when the Aluminum Company of America initiated land purchases along the Little Tennessee River. After the Southern Railroad's line extension from Chilhowee to what is now Alcoa, the Aluminum Company of America was able to follow through with plans for a plant in the new town of Alcoa. At the end of World War II, African Americans migrated from the Deep South to Blount County for employment and settled in the "Black Bottom" part of Alcoa. As African Americans started to form a permanent community in Alcoa, they organized an AME church that met initially in homes. The church members decided to request Aluminum Company Superintendent Glascock's assistance in building a church. Glascock agreed, after receiving a letter from Mrs. Lillie Bruton, and a church-planning committee was formed. As part of the agreement with Superintendent Glascock, the Aluminum Company provided building materials for a temporary dwelling; thus, by late 1918, the AME Church of Alcoa established a place of worship in a one-room building on Rankin RD, part of the South Hall community. The congregation quickly outgrew the dwelling and the Aluminum Company provided them with a larger, four-room house on Howell Street. In this new location, the AME Conference sent Reverend T. W. West to serve as the pastor. Eventually, as the congregation increased, the church moved to a site on the northeast corner of Edison Street and the southeast corner of Bell Street. The church officially changed its named to St. Paul AME Church at the time of the building's erection in 1921. During the 1920s, the congregation boasted four hundred members. Further work was done on the building over the next few decades. In 1985, the Alcoa City Commission honored the church for its restoration work. At the time of fieldwork, Reverend George L. Byrd served as pastor. During Byrd's tenure, the church underwent a series of repairs and updates. These included rest room and dining room renovations, sanctuary paneling, window refinishing, the church roof replacement, parking lot repairs, landscaping, and the painting of the steps, foundation, trim and window frames. Byrd was also instrumental in convincing the City of Alcoa to install a new sewage system in the community. In 1998, the church was deemed eligible for the National Register.</dc:description>
