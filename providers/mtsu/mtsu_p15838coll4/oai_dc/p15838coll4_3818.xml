<dc:description>Established around 1879, Friendship CME Church is believed to be one of Benton County&#8217;s oldest churches. The original church building stood on the same land occupied by the current building. After the original building started to deteriorate, the congregation used a school building owned by Moore&#8217;s Chapel Methodist Church. Friendship CME Church, in 1970, acquired one acre of land from James Jennings to construct a new church building and cemetery on the original site. A small cemetery on Manley Chapel RD affiliated with the church was created in 1981. Reverend Donald Cantrell currently served as pastor at the time that the property was investigated.</dc:description>
