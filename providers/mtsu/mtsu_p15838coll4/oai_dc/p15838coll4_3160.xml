<dc:description>East End Baptist Church was organized in 1917 by Reverend G. G. Austin and the present building was constructed in 1947 under leadership of Rev. C. J. Austin. The historical significance of East End Baptist to the Civil Rights Movement in Birmingham is closely tied to Rev. Calvin Woods,  church pastor from 1958 to 1974. Under his leadership the church participated in the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights and Project C, which sought confrontation with the city's establishment through non-violent demonstrations. In 1963 Rev. Woods, a close associate of Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, led sit-in demonstrations at local cafeterias and led followers to pray at the jail where the Revs. M.L. King and Ralph Abernathy were held.</dc:description>
