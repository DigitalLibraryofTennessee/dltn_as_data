<dc:description>Color photograph of a two-building complex featuring two adjoining wooden structures. The red side gable roof building on the left appears to be an original Rosenwald school. It is characterized by two banks of five windows (now boarded up) and is sitting on pier blocks. The other building, which appears to join the north end of the original school building at a ninety degree angle, is a long low building featuring a red side gable shed roof over an open porch. It has two visible entrances and four windows. On the far right end, the porch has been enclosed.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Waco School was built with support of the Julius Rosenwald fund.
