<dc:description>Metropolitan Community Church was organized in 1938 and the church was built in the Woodlawn neighborhood of Birmingham in phases between 1946 and 1953. It is a small building of concrete block construction and partially faced with local sandstone. The Pentecostal church is significant for its association with the Civil Rights Movement in Birmingham from 1956 to 1963 and for its association with African American ethnic identity in Birmingham. Woodlawn was home to the most active Ku Klux Klan group in Birmingham, but Metropolitan Community Church never suffered Klan violence. It is part of the smaller, working-class congregations that supported the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights (ACMHR) and Project C demonstrations, in part by making the church available for meetings. In 1977, the church attracted national attention as its pastor, Reverend Elizabeth Cobbs, testified against her uncle Robert Chambliss during his trial for the murder of Carol Denise McNair, one of the four girls killed in the bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in 1963.</dc:description>
