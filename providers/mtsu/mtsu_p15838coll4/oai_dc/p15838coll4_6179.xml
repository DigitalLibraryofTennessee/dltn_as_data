<dc:description>Color photograph of a historic home's smokehouse and kitchen viewed from the south.  Both the first and second stories are identical with the exception of some windows have louvered shutters where the window either below or above does not.  There are seven six-over-six double hung sash windows on each floor.  The fifth set of windows from the left have been included at a later date, along with the brickwork around them, than the original structure.  Originally this section was an open breezeway that separated the kitchen on the left and the smokehouse on the right.  The smokehouse has a tall brick smokestack rising from the  hipped roof.  There is a shorter brick chimney rising from the kitchen.  The roof is made of corrugated tin.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Rippavilla was built by Nathaniel Cheairs IV.  Construction began in 1852 and commenced in 1855.  Rippavilla and its farmland was the location where General John Bell Hood's Confederate troops set up camp in late November of 1864.  The Union Army marched past the Confederates while they were asleep through the night along the Columbia-Franklin Turnpike, what is now known as U.S. Highway 31.  The house remained in the Cheairs family until 1920.</dc:description>
