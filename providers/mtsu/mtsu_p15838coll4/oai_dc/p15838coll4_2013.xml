<dc:description>The evolution of the Webster Farm can be traced to 1807, when Jonathan Webster III, a Revolutionary War veteran and retired merchant moved from Georgia to Tennessee and bought a 500 acre tract along Big Bigby Creek.  There, he constructed a three pen cottage, ca. 1810 and ca. 1826 a large two-story Federal I-house was added onto the existing structure. Webster's farm prospered, as he raised cotton and experimented in raising livestock.  In his lifetime, Webster was an active politician and an enterprising agriculturalist. In 1847, the farm was sold to a Mr. Harlan, whose later family added a Classical Revival front porch to the house in the early 1900s. In the 1950s, the farm passed into the hands of the Osborn family, and in 1994,  the Webster family regained possession of the farm. The farm is significant because of its association with Jonathan Webster, an early settler, politician, and agriculturist of Middle Tennessee. Furthermore, the farm is significant because it possesses excellent examples of early-nineteenth century architecture and early-twentieth century outbuildings that relate to the influence of progressive farming techniques on the built environment of Middle Tennessee.</dc:description>
