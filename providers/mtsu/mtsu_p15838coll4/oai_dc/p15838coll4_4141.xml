<dc:description>Color photograph of church front and side. The church is a red brick, gable-front building. The plain facade contains a cornerstone on the bottom right corner and a handmade sign above the portico. The sign's lettering reads, "3rd Ave. Baptist Church." Although it appears to be one story, the church also contains a basement level.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Third Avenue Baptist, named for its street address, is a congregation located in Huntingdon, Tennessee. Golden Eagle Lodge 110, a Masonic chapter housed down the street, built the current church in 1953. Located in a rural community, Third Avenue Baptist Church sits adjacent to railroad tracks. A concrete-block building is located next to the church. At the time of fieldwork, the small building operated as a black beauty parlor. Reverend Troy Cox served as pastor of the church at that time.</dc:description>
