<dc:description>Black and white photograph of Bowman Chapel's side viewed from West Walnut Street. The building features two distinct sections: a front section with a steeple, tower, and pointed arch windows; a rear addition with six-over-six double-hung windows and two doors with nine glass panes. Steps with handrails appear at the intersection of the front and rear sections. Another set of steps leads to the second-floor door on the south elevation. The Gothic influences on the front section are not evident on the rear addition that dates from a later period.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Bowman Chapel United Methodist is rural African American church in Dickson, Tennessee. The current building shows Gothic influences, such as the pointed arched windows, and dates to 1920. At time of fieldwork, the building was believed to be eligible for the National Register. Reverend Ken Murray served as pastor at that time.</dc:description>
