<dc:description>Christian Valley Baptist Church, originated in 1914, is locally significant for its association with the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights and the Civil Rights Movement in Birmingham from 1956 to 1963.  The church is an example of the smaller, working class based North Birmingham Baptist congregations that supported the ACMHR.  Its pastor during the Civil Rights era was Rev. A. Lawrence Lawson, who was an active voice in the ACMHR and was a part of the Collegeville Baptist ministers who strongly supported Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth and the activism carried out by the nearby Bethel Baptist Church.  The church itself never hosted a mass meeting of the entire ACMHR due to its small size, but congregation members held planning sessions at the church and later conducted Voter Registration information sessions and registration drives.</dc:description>
