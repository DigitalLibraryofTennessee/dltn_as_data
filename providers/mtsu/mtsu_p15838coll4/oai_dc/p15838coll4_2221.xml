<dc:description>The Julius Freed House, constructed circa 1871, is significant for its association with Julius Freed, a Confederate Veteran and important merchant in Trenton from the Reconstruction Era to the early twentieth century. He was born in Prussia on January 25, 1835 and came to the United States in 1854. The house is also significant as an historically intact example of an Italianate-influenced "up-right and wing" vernacular dwelling as well as for its decorative painted mantles of the plain painter tradition.The house was once referred to as Villa Freed.</dc:description>
