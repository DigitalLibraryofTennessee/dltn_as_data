<dc:description>Color photograph of the fa&#231;ade and north elevation, photographer facing the northwest corner of the building. The fa&#231;ade of the building faces west on Green Street, and the north elevation runs along Griffin Avenue. The northwest corner of the building features a tall square bell tower with a steeply-pitched pyramid bonnet roof topped by a large cross. Just below the roof, two narrow, arched openings are visible on each of the elevations. The top section of the tower is supported by split brick pilasters on each corner, each divided into three sections with a solid connection between. The top of the bell tower section is supported by a row of brick corbels. The bottom half of the tower includes a pair of arched, stained-glass windows on the north and west elevations, each with a concrete keystone and two concrete imposts separated by a triple-row of brick. The lowest level of the tower includes two arched stained glass windows with matching keystones and imposts on the north elevation and a pair of wood double doors with a stained glass fanlight beneath a matching arch on the west-facing fa&#231;ade. A single metal light fixture on an arm projects out from the keystone of the arch, providing light for the main entrance. The doors are accessed via a set of concrete steps with plain, wrought-iron railings on either side. The stairs are flanked by a low concrete wall on either side. The enclosed foundation of the church is white-painted concrete. The fa&#231;ade is asymmetrical, as the northwest corner bell tower intrudes on it. A smaller bell tower is situated at the south end of the fa&#231;ade. The central part of the fa&#231;ade has a gable front roof with a small square brick pediment at its apex to which a decoy or statue of an owl has been affixed. The roofline of the gable end is cement, and the south end has a small flat section at its end. The brickwork below the roofline includes a series of brick corbels like those on the bell tower, though as they move down at an angle they give the effect of brick bargeboard. Roughly two thirds from the apex, two of the corbels extend down to the foundation to form split pilasters like those on the bell tower. There are two circular openings beneath the apex of the roof, one small, open, and edged in cement, the other a rosette window with a clear glass storm window over it. Between the pilaster and the northwest bell tower are two rows of windows. The top row is four arched stained glass window, each with its own cement keystone sharing imposts with its partners, like those on the northwest bell tower, those each here has its own cement sill. The row below includes four vertical rectangular stained glass windows, each with a cement lintel and sill. The windows are arranged so that they appear to be four very tall windows interrupted by brick and cement. Another such window, with one arched on top and other rectangular below, sits between the brick pilaster and the southwest tower. The southwest tower is very similar to the northwest bell tower. It has no bell, and therefore its pyramid bonnet roof is peaked by a sharp spike and it has no set of open arches. It also includes a pair of arched, stained-glass windows and matching double doors, those this set does not include the light fixture. A small section of brick fa&#231;ade is visible at the south end of the building. A church sign sits on a small grass lawn between the two sets of stairs. The top part of the sign is house-shaped with a wide base and has GREEN STREET BAPTIST CHURCH painted on it. It is supported by two square pillars, and the lower section is a long rectangular box with an enclosed letter board. Three wooden crosses, one set in front of the other two, are on the lawn facing the Green Street. There are trimmed boxwoods in front of the foundation along the fa&#231;ade. A cement sidewalk runs along Green Street, sloping down to street level. To the south of the church building, the posts from a missing chainlink fence are visible. The back of a stop sign for the intersection of Green Street and Griffin Avenue is visible in the foreground, and a red fire hydrant with a yellow cap sits at the corner. Moving down the west elevation, there is a partial view of a white cupola with a metal roof obscured by the northwest bell tower. This elevation includes a symmetrical gable-end section that projects slightly from the main body of the church, and the northeastern corner includes a small tower. A 1962 addition is visible at the east of the small tower. The asphalt-shingle roof of the gable end section contains visible damage, and the north wall bows out visibly. Roof damage is visible at the seam where the north-facing gable section and the west-facing gable of the fa&#231;ade meet behind the northwest bell tower. A circular drainpipe sits at this intersection. The north-facing gable end is slightly different from the gable-end of the fa&#231;ade. It has the same sharply-pitched cement roofline, but there is no decoy atop the small brick and cement pediment. The roofline ends in short horizontal sections supported by brick corbels extending from a split pilaster on the west end. The north gable end features the same brick corbels/split pilasters as the fa&#231;ade. The corbels below the apex of the gable end include three vertical setback sections, and below it is a small narrow section of corbels like the ones on the northwest bell tower. A triple-arched louvered window sits below the apex, with no keystone or imposts, divided by brick with a shared cement sill. The window pattern below follows the same pattern as the fa&#231;ade, only symmetrical; a set of four arched, stained glass windows in the center with vertical rectangular ones below, and a single arched stained glass window with a rectangular one below on either side past the split pilasters. These windows all have cement keystones and imposts. In the white foundation at the base of the gable end, small openings are visible to allow the foundation to breathe. The tower at the northeast corner follows the same basic pattern as the other two towers. Its roof is identical to the southwest tower, and it has the same pattern of corbels and split pilasters with two rows of arched stained glass windows on the bottom half. This tower, however, is brick all the way to the base, and includes a pair of arched louvered windows like those below the apex of the north gable end. A white cornerstone is visible on the lower section of the northeast corner of the tower. The 1962 education wing is just visible, with a three-bay symmetrical fa&#231;ade and low-pitched or flat roof. The bays are divided by solid brick pilasters. The central bay includes a four-pane window on the top section, with the horizontal muntin set low. Below the window is a painted sign reading GREEN STREET BAPTIST EDUCATION WING. Below the sign is an asphalt roof slightly pyramid shaped awning with wood brackets over a white painted double door. The left bay includes a four-pane window at top and bottom, identical to the one in the central bay. The cornerstone is partly visible behind a telephone pole. The right bay includes a matching window on the top story with a five-by-two fixed vertical window below it. All of the windows have cement sills. A sidewalk runs along the north elevation, extending all the way to the street in front of the northwest bell tower, but with a grass median on the east sections</dc:description>
<dc:description>The congregation of Green Street Baptist Church formed in 1881, primarily from the congregation of First Baptist Church (Colored), which was then known as the St. Phillip Street Baptist Church (due to their location). The church was led by Reverend John Blevins, who had been pastor at St. Phillip Street, thus the church was originally known as &#8220;The John Blevins Church.&#8221; He remained there for two or three years. On December 31, 1881, church trustees Jefferson Richardson, Joseph Baylock, Adam Clayton, and Henry Lamar purchased a lot on the corner of Green Street and McCreary Avenue (now Griffin Avenue) for $150. The first worship services were held in a store on the corner.  The first church the congregation built was a small frame building on a lot adjacent to wear the brick church now stands. The frame church was small and uncomfortable, unable to accommodate the congregation of 200 souls (with 300 attending Sunday School). The interior of the original structure was lit by three lanterns hanging from the ceiling and a tin lamp on each side wall. The minister had a small platform to stand on, and the children sat on the edge. The original frame building was replaced once by a larger frame church, and again by a brick church, which was dedicated in 1892. The current building was dedicated in 1922. The plan for the building came to Pastor James A. Martin in a dream, and it was designed and built by contractor A.J. Farley, which accounts for the church&#8217;s unusual architectural features. Between 1937 and 1946, the church building was renovated and restrooms added. Between 1946 and 1958, the church was renovated again, including the purchase of new pews and floor coverings, and a paved sidewalk was added around the church. In 1946, the church opened a kindergarten, which operated for 14 years. In 1962, the church added an education wing. The late 1980s saw another interior renovation, accompanied by a new roof and renovated restrooms. In the late 1990s, a truss in the church&#8217;s roof failed, which has led to significant damage to the structure, including the bowing of the sanctuary wall on Griffin Avenue, the holes in the roof, and extensive interior damage from exposure to the elements. The remaining congregation currently worships in the education wing.  Green Street&#8217;s current state belies its historical significance. During the 1960s, the church enjoyed a thriving congregation, and its kitchen was used to prepare meals for marchers in the Selma to Montgomery March in 1965. The considerable space in both the education wing and the main sanctuary were also used to provide temporary housing for civil rights workers. On June 5, 1964, the church hosted a mass meeting featuring Ralph Abernathy of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Following the meeting, someone threw a rock at some of the deputized possemen who had surrounded the church during the meeting. The possemen responded by attacking the crowd as it tried to exit the church, using night sticks and tear gas. The riot continued in the neighborhood, injuring many of the black residents and putting some in the hospital. Homes up to a block and a half away from the church were damaged, with broken windows and porch lights. Two white journalists were targeted and their cameras destroyed by possemen. </dc:description>
