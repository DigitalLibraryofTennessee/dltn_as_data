<dc:description>Blythe Ferry, one of Tennessee's most important Trail of Tears landmarks, is located on the Tennessee River between Meigs and Rhea Counties. William Blythe, a mixed-ancestry Native American, began operating the ferry on the Federal Road in 1809. Following Blythe&#8217;s death in 1856, the ferry passed through several hands  before being replaced by a bridge in 1994. The historical ferry landings now lie under the waters of the Chickamauga impoundment. The Cherokee Removal Memorial Park has been constructed at the site.</dc:description>
