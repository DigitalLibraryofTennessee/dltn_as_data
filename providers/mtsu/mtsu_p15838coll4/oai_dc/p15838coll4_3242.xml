<dc:description>Shady Grove Baptist Church is associated with the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights and the Civil Rights Movement in Birmingham from 1956 to 1963. The congregation dates to the beginning of settlement in the Collegeville neighborhood, a middle class and working class African-American neighborhood, and was organized in 1902 by Reverend S.M. Smart as one of the early African American Baptist congregations in Collegeville. Construction of the present building began in 1942.  It became a locally significant strategy center for ACMHR.  Congregation members held strategy sessions there in 1963 about their roles in the Project C demonstrations. Reverend Lewis J. Rogers also held ACMHR Finance Committee meetings at the church in order to raise funds to support legal challenges to segregation and to provide bail for jailed demonstrators and ACMHR officials.</dc:description>
