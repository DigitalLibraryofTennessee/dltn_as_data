<dc:description>Woodlawn Baptist Church was formed at least as early as the 1850s by Harden Smith. From the building of the sanctuary in 1865, to 1890, the congregation grew rapidly. In 1891, an additional 2.5 acres were purchased from James D. and Lucy E. Read to accommodate the expanded congregation. In 1927-28, a new building was constructed. In the 1950s, Rev. J.A. Caldwell launched a campaign to pay off the mortgage and building campaign for a Sunday School annex. The church is known as a community center for Civil Rights activism and as having a long tradition with music.</dc:description>
