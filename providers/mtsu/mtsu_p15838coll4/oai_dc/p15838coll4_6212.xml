<dc:description>The Spring Hill Cemetery is the principle cemetery used by the city of Spring Hill, Tennessee.  It has been in operation since 1840 and is the final resting place for many Spring Hill and Maury County families.  Members of the McKissack and Cheairs families are laid to rest here.  It is also the final resting place for twenty-five Confederate soldiers who died during the Battles of Spring Hill and Thompson's Station.  A memorial was recently presented recognizing the Confederate soldiers who died during these battles.</dc:description>
