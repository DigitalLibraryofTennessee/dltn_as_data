<dc:description>Brief description of Williams Grove Cemetery's location and markers.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Williams Groves Baptist congregation was established in 1950 and first gathered in a schoolhouse. Around 1958, Williams Grove Baptist relocated to a concrete-block building, circa 1940-1950.  In the 1980s, a frame building, located adjacent to the concrete-block building, took over as the church's sanctuary. Another architectural evolution occurred when vinyl siding was added. At the time of fieldwork, the two churches were not believed to be eligible for the National Register and Rev. Carvene Jameson served as the pastor. Williams Grove Cemetery is nestled on a gravel drive about a third of mile beyond the current church. Consistent with the age of the congregation, the cemetery's earliest burial dates to 1938.</dc:description>
