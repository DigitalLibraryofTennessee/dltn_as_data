<dc:description>Brochure for the 48th annual meeting of the Kentucky-Tennessee Chapter of American Studies Association, held at the Shaker Village of Pleasant Hill, in Harrodsburg, KY. Part of the program includes a research paper on South Guthrie, TN. Established in 1868, Guthrie is a town of the New South. When a railroad junction was completed there in 1870, the town became more than a place name and started to grow. Race sharply defined the town's physical environment, with Guthrie, KY as a white settlement, and South Guthrie, TN inhabited by African Americans. The listed research paper, presented to the American Studies Association Kentucky-Tennessee Chapter, discusses the Vinegar Hill Cemetery, Guildfield Baptist Church, and the Warfield Rosenwald School.</dc:description>
