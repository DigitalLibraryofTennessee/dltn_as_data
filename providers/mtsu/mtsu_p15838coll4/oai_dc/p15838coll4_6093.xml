<dc:description>Clover Bottom, an Italianate mansion and plantation property, is located in the Donelson community of Metropolitan Nashville. Originally encompassing 1500 acres of land, the property has decreased in size over the years. Clover Bottom saw a number of owners from 1816 to 1946: James Hoggatt, Andrew Price, and A.F. Stanford. In 1858, Dr. James Hoggatt built one of the first Italianate mansions in Middle Tennessee. This house replaced an earlier Greek Revival mansion from 1854 that was destroyed by fire in 1856. Clover Bottom eventually housed the Tennessee School for the Blind, but it was vacated in 1980. The General Assembly appropriated $300,000 for preservation efforts and the MTSU Center for Historic Preservation developed a historic structure report in 1988 to guide this process. The Tennessee Historical Commission currently operates out of the Clover Bottom Mansion.</dc:description>
