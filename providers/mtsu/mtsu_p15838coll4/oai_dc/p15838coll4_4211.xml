<dc:description>Wingo Missionary Baptist Church, located in Trezevant, Tennessee, dates back to 1874. Although the church's roots are in the late nineteenth century, its current building was constructed in the early 1960s. According to the church cornerstone, Caldonia Lodge No. 79 helped construct the present building. The rural church sits next to railroad tracks running parallel to Highway U.S. 79. A church cemetery, Wingo Chapel Cemetery, is located nearby and contains burials dating from the twentieth century. According to the fieldnotes, the church is associated with a Rosenwald school. The Wingo School, located in Carroll County, was a Rosenwald school that was "destroyed by wind storm on May 10, 1927." Another Wingo School existed by 1941. Based on photographic comparison and location, the building across Wingo Circle from Wingo Baptist Church appears to be the Wingo School.</dc:description>
