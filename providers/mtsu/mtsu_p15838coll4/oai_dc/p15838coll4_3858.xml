<dc:description>Color photograph of St. Paul AME Church. The concrete-block building is covered in vinyl siding. Enclosed vestibule area contains black double doors embellished with small crosses. Central steps with minor handrails lead to the double doors. Sign above the doorway and below a light fixture reads "ST PAUL AME CHURCH." Gable roof of main building is significantly steeper than that of the vestibule's roof. Air conditioning unit and windows are slightly visible on the side. An addition can be seen behind the main building. In front of the church building, a white sign next to a concrete walkway reads "St. Paul A.M.E. Church; Wartrace, Tennessee; Pastor: Rev. James L. Taylor." Between the white sign and the church building is a brick marquee sign with a stepped gable design.</dc:description>
<dc:description>St. Paul AME Church dates from approximately 1940. During the 1950s, an African American school sat behind the church building. Although the church building is composed of concrete blocks, vinyl siding was added at a later period. At the time of fieldwork, Rev. James L. Taylor served as pastor. More recently, Kenneth Odom held the pastorship.</dc:description>
