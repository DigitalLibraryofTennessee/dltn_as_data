<dc:description>Color photograph of a historic photograph of Oaklawn.  The picture is viewed from the south and shows the front facade.  The picture dates from the ca. 1940s.  A non-extant fence and gate can be seen in the foreground.  Much of the same vegetation seen flanking the pathway is still growing today.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Oaklawn was built in 1835 for Absalom Thompson.  The original structure was built in a Federal style, ell-shaped and one-and-a-half stories high.  The home was rebuilt in 1860 in the Greek Revival style and enlarged to two full stories.  The home served as headquarters for Confederate General John Bell Hood during the Battle of Spring Hill in November of 1864.  This is the infamous location where General Hood slept while Union forces marched past his troops toward Franklin, TN.  the house stayed in the Thompson family until 1911.  The interior was renovated to become a tenant house and suffered from decay.  In the 1940s, the building was returned to its original condition.  The rear portico was enclosed in the 1950s.  The exterior remains much the same as it did when it was remodeled in 1860.  The building served as the home for country and western performers George Jones and Tammy Wynette during the early 1970s.  The building is now privately owned.</dc:description>
