<dc:description>Organized in 1921 as the Collage [sic] Park Church, the West End Hills Missionary Baptist Church has been a southwest Birmingham fixture since the late 1950s. The church is significant as one of the churches involved in the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights in the Civil Rights era. West End Hills Missionary Baptist Church is an outstanding example of the smaller, working-class based congregations that supported the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights from 1959 to 1965. Many members of the congregation regularly attended and participated in ACMHR meetings. While the unassuming church was too small to host a regular ACMHR meeting, congregation members, guided by Rev. Coleman M. Smith, met there and planned how they would participate in the mass demonstrations of Project C in the spring of 1963.</dc:description>
