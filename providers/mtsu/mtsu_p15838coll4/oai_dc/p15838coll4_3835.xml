<dc:description>Black and white photograph of Moore's Chapel, a nearby church that owned the block building temporarily used by Friendship CME. It is a modern, concrete-block building. Vestibule of the church contains double doors with nine-paned windows. A single handrail enables access from the steps to the entranceway. Windows on the front of building appear to be painted over and no longer functional for lighting. A door appears on the facade, to the left of the vestibule. Another door appears in an addition on the right side. On the right exterior side of the building, a window remains without paint. obstructing the panes. The main building exhibits a cross-gabled roof design. The addition to the right features a gable and shed combination roof. A small, brick chimney juts from the far right of the addition's roof. All three gables in the church contain wooden planks.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Established around 1879 as Moore Chapel Colored Methodist Episcopal Church, later renamed Friendship Christian Methodist Episcopal, the church is believed to be one of Benton County&#8217;s oldest churches. A small cemetery affiliated with the church, known as Moore Chapel-Flatwoods Cemetery, was established ca. 1881. The original church building stood on the same site occupied by the current building. After the original building started to deteriorate, the congregation used a school building owned by Moore&#8217;s Chapel Methodist Church. Friendship CME later acquired one acre of land to construct a new church building and cemetery on the original site, completing the building in 1989.   Reverends Geneva Cherry and J.E. Robinson served as pastors at the time the property was investigated.</dc:description>
