<dc:description>The current King Chapel Church building dates from the 1960s. Vinyl siding was added to the frame and additional work was completed in the 1980s. At the time of fieldwork (July 23, 1998), W. L. Rippy served as pastor and the church was thought to have once been the largest in the village.</dc:description>
