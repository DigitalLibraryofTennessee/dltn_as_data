<dc:description>The Cleburne Jersey Farm dates to approximately 1872, when the extant Italianate-styled home and limestone dairy house were built for the Campbell family.  Prior to the Civil War the farm was part of a large plantation belonging to George Washington Campbell. Following the war, the land was divided into the Ewell farm and the Cleburne farm, where McCoy (Mack) Campbell soon built the first herd of Jersey dairy cattle in Tennessee. In the 1880s, the property began to be called the Cleburne Jersey Farm, and in 1885 the dairy herd was significantly expanded.  The Campbell family played a large role in establishing the Jersey as a leading breed of dairy cattle both through breeding and by importing stock from the Isle of Jersey.  At the time of it's nomination to the National Register of Historic Places the farm was still held and managed by members of the Campbell family.</dc:description>
