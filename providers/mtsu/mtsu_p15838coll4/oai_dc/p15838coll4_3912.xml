<dc:description>Color photograph of church front. Two of the church's three sections can be seen. Crab orchard stone and wood paneled vestibule protrudes from the brick section. Stone decorative shutters flanking multi-paned windows are visible on the brick section. To the left of the vestibule, brick veneer covers a frame section of the church. This section's facade contains a  three-part cornerstone. The gable vent of the third section is visible at the roof's ridge. Sidewalk leads to the glass, double doors of the vestibule. Cross emblems appear on the sides of the enclosed bell tower. Flagpole sits in front of the church.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Established in September of 1904, Mt. Zion AME Zion Church provided the African-American community of Louisville with a place of worship and a school. During this first stage of the church's development, Reverend M.M. Morris served as pastor. In 1929, the church was rebuilt under the leadership of Reverend Ella B. Robinson. Yet again, in 1942, the church moved to a new location under the leadership of Reverend M.H. Smith. Due to the many stages of the church's development, the current building reflects different construction periods and materials.</dc:description>
