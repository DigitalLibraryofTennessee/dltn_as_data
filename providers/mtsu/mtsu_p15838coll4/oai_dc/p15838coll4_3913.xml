<dc:description>Established in September of 1904, Mt. Zion AME Zion Church provided the African-American community of Louisville with a place of worship and a school. During the first stage of the church's development, Reverend M.M. Morris served as pastor. In 1929, the church was rebuilt under the leadership of Reverend Ella B. Robinson. Yet again, in 1942, the church moved to a new location under the leadership of Reverend M.H. Smith. Indicative of the many stages of the church's development, the current building reflects different construction periods and materials.</dc:description>
