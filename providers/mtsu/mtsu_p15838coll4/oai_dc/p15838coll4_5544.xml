<dc:description>Grassmere is a historic house in Nashville, Tennessee. The present Italianate residence originated as a Tennessee Federal style building. Michael C. Dunn purchased the property of 272.5 acres in 1810 from Alex Simpson and eventually added a hundred acres. This sizable holding enabled Dunn to sell 330 acres of his property to his son-in-law Lee Shute in 1846. The property remained in the Shute family through the Civil War and into the early twentieth century. From 1876 to 1881, the house was remodeled to adhere to Victorian aesthetics. Electricity and plumbing eventually replaced gas lighting. In 1964, Margaret and Elise Croft, the last direct members of the Shute family line, bequeathed Grassmere to the Cumberland Museum (Children's Museum of Nashville later the Adventure Science Center) upon their deaths. Grassmere Wildlife Park opened in 1990, but it closed in 1995 and Nashville Metro acquired the property. Due to the will stipulations of the Croft sisters, the property had to be preserved as a "natural study center." The Nashville Zoo, therefore, relocated to the Grassmere property in December of 1996. In 1998, the home was opened to the public and the farm followed suit by 1999.</dc:description>
