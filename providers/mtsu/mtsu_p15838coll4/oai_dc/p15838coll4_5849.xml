<dc:description>Mt. Zion CME Church (now Mt. Zion Worship Center) is a historic congregation and cemetery on Mt. Zion Road, in the vicinity of Bradford, Gibson County, TN. Literally located in the middle of cotton fields, Mt. Zion is considered one of the county&#8217;s oldest rural African American churches. The current church building is circa 1980, with remodeling and expansions dating to 2008, when the congregation changed the name to Mt Zion Worship Center. The cemetery has identified burials to the late 1870s and it is still in use by the congregation. Adjacent to the church is the historic Mt. Zion school, which the church owns. Together the presence of the historic school, the church, and historic cemetery speaks volumes about the nature of clustering African American institutions in the Jim Crow era as well as the often close relationship between church and public education in the rural African American communities.</dc:description>
