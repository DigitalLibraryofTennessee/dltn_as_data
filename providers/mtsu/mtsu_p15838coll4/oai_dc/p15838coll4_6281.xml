<dc:description>Color photograph of the north elevation or fa&#231;ade of the 1962 education wing of Green Street Baptist Church, photographer facing south. A telephone wire crosses the upper left hand corner of the image. The fa&#231;ade of the two-story brick education wing is divided into three unequal bays by brick pilasters, with the easternmost being wider than the other two.  The easternmost bay includes a six-light window on each floor with a concrete sill, with a gutterpipe extending from the eave to the ground level beside the pilaster. A marble cornerstone on the lower left corner of the building reads  GREEN STREET BAPTIST CHURCH EDUCATIONAL DEPARTMENT ANNO DOMINI MCMLXII and a list of the deacons, secretary, and pastor, whose names are not legible in the photo. A floodlight is mounted to the brick to the left of the bottom corner of the second story window. The central bay includes a window on the upper floor and a hip roof asphalt shingle awning extending over a door on the lower level. The awning is supported by white-painted wood brackets. A pair of plain light fixtures are mounted to either side of the door; only the one on the right includes a lightbulb. Between the upper and lower floors, a white wood sign with black lettering is surrounded by headers. It reads GREEN STREET BAPTIST CHURCH EDUCATIONAL DEPT. The westernmost bay includes a six-light window on the upper floor and a ten-light window on the lower floor, each with a concrete sill. A small PVC drainpipe protrudes from near the foundation below and to the right of the lower level window. A partial view of the original building includes a portion of the east-facing gable end, a partial view of the east elevation of the northeast tower, including brick corbels and and a pair of arched, louvered windows with a quadruple row of headers and concrete sills. There is a partial view of the north elevation of the northeast tower, including two split sections of brick pilaster, the sill and some louvers for a window at the top, and the concrete impost of a second window. A marble cornerstone is partly visible but not legible in the lower left corner of the tower. A sidewalk runs across the front of the photos, with some greenery growing in the small space between the sidewalk and the education wing. A grass median runs between the sidewalk and Griffin Avenue, which is not visible.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The congregation of Green Street Baptist Church formed in 1881, primarily from the congregation of First Baptist Church (Colored), which was then known as the St. Phillip Street Baptist Church (due to their location). The church was led by Reverend John Blevins, who had been pastor at St. Phillip Street, thus the church was originally known as &#8220;The John Blevins Church.&#8221; He remained there for two or three years. On December 31, 1881, church trustees Jefferson Richardson, Joseph Baylock, Adam Clayton, and Henry Lamar purchased a lot on the corner of Green Street and McCreary Avenue (now Griffin Avenue) for $150. The first worship services were held in a store on the corner.  The first church the congregation built was a small frame building on a lot adjacent to where the brick church now stands. The frame church was small and uncomfortable, unable to accommodate the congregation of 200 souls (with 300 attending Sunday School). The interior of the original structure was lit by three lanterns hanging from the ceiling and a tin lamp on each side wall. The minister had a small platform to stand on, and the children sat on the edge. The original frame building was replaced once by a larger frame church, and again by a brick church, which was dedicated in 1892. The current building was dedicated in 1922. The plan for the building came to Pastor James A. Martin in a dream, and it was designed and built by contractor A.J. Farley. It is a Romanesque Revival church with Italianate influences. Between 1937 and 1946, the church building was renovated and restrooms added. Between 1946 and 1958, the church was renovated again, including the purchase of new pews and floor coverings, and a paved sidewalk was added around the church. In 1946, the church opened a kindergarten, which operated for 14 years. In 1962, the church added an education wing. The late 1980s saw another interior renovation, accompanied by a new roof and renovated restrooms. In the late 1990s, a truss in the church&#8217;s roof failed, which has led to significant damage to the structure, including the bowing of the sanctuary wall on Griffin Avenue, the holes in the roof, and extensive interior damage from exposure to the elements. The remaining congregation currently worships in the education wing.  Green Street&#8217;s current state belies its historical significance. During the 1960s, the church enjoyed a thriving congregation, and its kitchen was used to prepare meals for marchers in the Selma to Montgomery March in 1965. The considerable space in both the education wing and the main sanctuary were also used to provide temporary housing for civil rights workers. On June 5, 1964, the church hosted a mass meeting featuring Ralph Abernathy of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Following the meeting, someone threw a rock at some of the deputized possemen who had surrounded the church during the meeting. The possemen responded by attacking the crowd as it tried to exit the church, using night sticks and tear gas. The riot continued in the neighborhood, injuring many of the black residents and putting some in the hospital. Homes up to a block and a half away from the church were damaged, with broken windows and porch lights. Two white journalists were targeted and their cameras destroyed by possemen.
