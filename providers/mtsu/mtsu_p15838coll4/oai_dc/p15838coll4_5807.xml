<dc:description>The T. W. Atkinson House was an 1820s house located on the Valentine Sevier Station property in Clarksville, Tennessee. Valentine Sevier cleared the land and built a stone house for his family in the 1790s. The settlement was called Sevier Station and designated as a gathering place for local residents seeking protection from Indian raids. On November 11, 1794, a raid occurred at the site. Thomas W. Atkinson eventually acquired the property on April 24, 1819 and built his home, known as the Atkinson House, to the east of Sevier Station. The property saw a number of owners over the decades and was known as the "Old McAllister Place" from 1877 to 1900. On July 20, 1965, the property was sold for $15,000 to the Trustees of Sevier Station. Sevier Station was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 6, 1971. Although a new metal roof was added and precautions taken against weathering, Atkinson House saw little attention beyond initial planning reports between 1971 and 1984. The MTSU Center for Historic Preservation conducted an investigation of the site at the request of the Clarksville Community Development Department and produced a historic structure report in May 1985. At that time, the house was under review for the National Register for Historic Places because of its proximity to Sevier Station. The review was a response to plans to demolish the building. Sevier Station is now run as a one-acre park, but Atkinson House has since been razed. The historic structure report serves as a permanent record of the interior and exterior architectural elements of the house, many of which are rarely found in early structures extant in this region. Since Sevier Station was placed on the National Register, some scholars have questioned the validity of the site's history and some believe the remaining stone building was actually a separate kitchen for the Atkinson House.</dc:description>
