<dc:description>History of Port Royal, including its association with the Trail of Tears and its importance to transportation in the area before the construction of the railroad.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Port Royal was an early trading center because of its location at the junction of the Red River and Sulfur  Fork. The earliest settlers arrived in 1784 and the town, named by the Samuel Wilcox family, incorporated  in 1797. The first post office was established in 1801. The Port Royal site represents the importance  of river transportation in early Tennessee history. The Port Royal Historic State Park was established in 1978 to preserve and protect the history of the early river town. The park is also designated as site on the Trail of  Tears National Historic Trail.</dc:description>
