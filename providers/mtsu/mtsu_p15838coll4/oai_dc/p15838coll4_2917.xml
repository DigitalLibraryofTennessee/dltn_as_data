<dc:description>The High Museum of Art, located in Midtown Atlanta's arts and business district, is the most prominent art museum in the southeastern United States, with extensive holdings in 19th and 20th century American art, African American Art; significant holdings of European paintings and decorative art; and collections of modern and contemporary art, photography and African art.  The High Museum of Art collects works by Southern artists and its curatorial department specializes in the field of folk and self-taught art. The museum was first established as the Atlanta Art Association in 1905 before being relocated in 1926 to a home on Peachtree Ave. that was donated by Harriet Harwell Wilson High. The Museum opened in a new building designed by Richard Meier at the Woodruff Arts Center in 1983. The innovative building featured a brilliant white facade of enameled steel. Three additional buildings designed by Renzo Piano that opened in 2002 reflect the original concept with facades of white aluminum</dc:description>
