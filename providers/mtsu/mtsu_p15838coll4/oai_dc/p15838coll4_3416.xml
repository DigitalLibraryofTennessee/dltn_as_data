<dc:description>First Baptist Church, Kingston was one of the leading Birmingham churches involved in the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights during the Civil Rights era of the 1950s and 1960s. Reverend George W. Dickerson, an officer in the ACMHR and active leader in the organization until his death, led the congregation from 1941 to 1972.  The church was one of the early activist congregations in the ACMHR.  It also held one of the most significant ACMHR mass meetings on May 15, 1961, the night following the vicious mob attack on the Freedom Riders at the Trailways Station in downtown Birmingham. The church was the location of five ACMHR mass meetings recorded in 1961 and 1962.</dc:description>
