Formerly located in the Tenth Civil District, now McKinney Avenue, the church moved to the corner of Kyle and Hasson Street in 1912. The Reverend William H. Franklin, founder and pastor, served St. Marks and Swift Memorial College. Buried on the Swift campus, in 1898, Dr. Franklin received an honorary doctorate from Maryville College. The church ministered to the Swift's faculty, students, and community. On July 21, 2002, the church dissolved. Its facility now serves the youth and community through the arts."</dc:description>
