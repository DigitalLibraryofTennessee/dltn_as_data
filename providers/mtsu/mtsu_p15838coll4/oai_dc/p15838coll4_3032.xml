<dc:description>Sardis Baptist Church played a key role in the advancement of civil rights in Alabama, most notably as the site of a 1956 meeting at which the Alabama Christian Movement for Civil Rights (ACMHR)  was formed. ACMHR replaced the NAACP, which was banned by the State of Alabama, and was a contributor to formation of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.  Sardis Baptist was one of many African American churches in Birmingham and elsewhere that hosted regular mass meetings to combine worship with advancement of civil rights efforts.    The congregation of Sardis Baptist Church dates to 1884 but its buildings were constructed during the twentieth century: a Gothic Revival building in 1907 and a large education building in 1962-63. The church served a stable working-class community on Enon Ridge and was very much a community center.</dc:description>
