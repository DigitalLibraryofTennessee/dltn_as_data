<dc:description>Quinn Chapel is a large, Gothic-style brick church located in downtown Paris, TN that is located immediately adjacent to the Paris City Cemetery.  The cemetery was a prominent burial ground for white citizens of the area, dating to the mid-19th century. Notable graves include John Wesley Crockett, son to David, and Isham Harris, Governor of Tennessee during the civil war. The cemetery also houses a large monument, dedicated in 2006, that honors the unmarked graves of slaves and other African Americans and the role they played in the early days of Henry County</dc:description>
