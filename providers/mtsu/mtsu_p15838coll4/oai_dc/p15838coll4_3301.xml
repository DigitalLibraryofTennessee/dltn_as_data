<dc:description>Color photograph of the front of a two story yellow brick building with four two story towers. The seven-bay east facade features a three-bay entrance. The main block of the building is slightly recessed from the towers on either side. The full-height, pedimented portico is supported by four Doric columns and is set within the recessed space between the towers.  An entablature with dentilled cornice runs across the fa&#231;ade. Just below the entablature, above the second story windows, a molded wood belt-course runs along the building. Each of the towers has a parapet above the entablature. A set of concrete steps with metal railings leads to the main entrance. Multi-light double-doors lead inside the church. Above the door is a transom showing the year 1886, the year Tabernacle services began at this location, and the year 1922, when this building was dedicated. The entryway has a soldier-course lintel and simple wood surrounds. Above the door is a large stained glass window with a stone sill and unadorned wood surrounds. Flanking the door on either side are paired stained glass windows on each story. The windows have a stone sill, a soldier-course lintel and simple wood surrounds.  Within the recessed porch on the north and south ends of the tower, there are single, multi-light doors with single-light stained glass transoms above and simple wood surrounds. They each feature a soldier-course lintel. On each tower, there are two single stained glass windows on each story. The first story windows have stone sills, a soldier-course lintel, and wood surrounds. The second story windows have stone sills and wood surrounds. At the basement level, there are two four-light windows on each tower with soldier-course lintels and stone lintels. Each corner of the tower features decorative quoins.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Tabernacle Missionary Baptist was established in 1885 as a church for students at the Alabama Baptist Normal and Theological School, later Selma University. The current church building was designed by African American architect David T. West and  constructed in 1922 as a two-story Classical Revival brick building.  Tabernacle Missionary Baptist is nationally significant due to its multiple associations with the Civil Rights Movement in Selma from 1922 to 1968 and for its statewide significance to African American Baptist history, especially the ministry of Rev. D. V. Jemison, who is associated with the expansion and development of the African American Baptist Church and served as president of the National Baptist Convention, USA.  </dc:description>
