<dc:description>Color photograph of the front of the Federal-style house that was constructed of bricks made onsite. Two chimneys are located at each end of a gable roof. A Georgian cornice finishes the brick wall below narrow eaves. Four nine-over-nine windows line the second story and two are located to each side of double entry doors that are covered by a one-story Greek Revival portico that was added after original construction.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Rucker-Mason farm is the site of the Rucker House, built ca. 1802-04, which is comprised of a two-story brick home of the I-house design and in the Federal style that is connected to a cedar log structure at the rear. A Greek Revival portico was added at a later date. The house retains its original brick exterior, including a Georgian cornice, brick lintel window treatments and brickwork in the Flemish Bond style. Numerous changes have been done to the buildings in the modern era but the buildings retain many features of early settlers' homes in the region. The house sits on land first acquired by Gideon Rucker, who purchased land warrants from Revolutionary War settlers, and then sold to Gideon's brother Bennett. The land passed to his daughter, Miriam, who married Henry Goodloe. Descendents of the Goodloes still owned the land at the time of fieldwork.</dc:description>
