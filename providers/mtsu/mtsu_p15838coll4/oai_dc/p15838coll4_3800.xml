<dc:description>Set originally in a Civil War-era log structure, the Asbury United Methodist Church was called Tate's Chapel after the first pastor, Rev. John C. Tate. A former slave, Tate gained prominence in Anderson County and was elected the clerk of the Circuit Court. The newly formed Methodist congregation appointed Tate as pastor and his name adorned the log church's cornerstone. Officially established on May 29, 1865, the church steadily gained membership, necessitating the construction of a new church. Once again, the church acquired a name from a church official. Dubbed the Asbury Methodist Episcopal Church, the new church building survived until a fire in 1947. The third and current brick building was finished in 1950.</dc:description>
