<dc:description>Located near the current terminus of the Natchez Trace Parkway along the banks of the Duck River, the John Gordon House is a two-story house that was built in 1818. Recognized as one of the earliest brick structures constructed on the Tennessee frontier and is associated with one of the state&#8217;s prominent pioneer families. In the early 1800s, John Gordon contracted with the Chief of the Chickasaw nation to operate a trading post and ferry at the Duck River crossing of the Trace. In 1805, when the United States negotiated a treaty with the Chickasaw for the Duck River lands, the Tennessee General Assembly granted Gordon 640 acres because of his accomplishments in the area. In 1812, Captain Gordon moved his family to his newly acquired plantation along the Duck River and established "Gordon's Ferry." Unfortunately, Captain Gordon lived for only seven years after the move to "Gordon's Ferry," dying of pneumonia contracted while fighting the Seminole Indians in Florida. Mrs. Gordon successfully managed the business of the farm and ferry and undertook the building of the brick residence, according to instructions left by her husband. Recognized as a fine example of an early Tennessee hall and parlor plan residence, the Federal style Gordon House is equally significant for its brick construction, a material rarely used on the frontier. Adjacent to the Gordon House is the Duck River cantonment, a temporary military post which was one of the many built by Colonel Thomas S. Butler in 1801 to open the road from Nashville to Natchez. John Gordon's widow continued to live in the house until her death in 1859. The house passed through a series of owners until the National Park Service purchased the property in 1977 and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. During the fall of 1989, students from the Middle Tennessee State University Center for Historic Preservation conducted fieldwork at Gordon House and produced a development plan for the site.</dc:description>
