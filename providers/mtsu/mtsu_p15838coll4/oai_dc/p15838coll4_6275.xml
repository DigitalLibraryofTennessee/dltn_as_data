<dc:description>Color photograph of a train station viewed from the west.  Visible in the foreground is the east wing.  It is a one-story structure with a stone foundation supporting a brick facade.  A brick walk surrounds the structure.  The front (north) facade of the east wing has five bays.  Three rectangular stationary windows with iron bars and two doors alternate in an asymmetrical fashion.  The east facade of the east wing has two rectangular stationary windows with iron bars in front.  Wide overhanging eaves are supported by carved wooden brackets.  A tin, hipped roof caps the structure.  The main, center structure is a two-story limestone building.  The east elevation of the main structure has two one-over-one double-hung sash windows on the second floor, one smaller and one larger.  One one-over-one double hung sash window and two single light fixed attic windows are located on the third floor of the east elevation of the main structure.  Inside the first floor is the main waiting room.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Columbia Union Station train depot was built from 1902 to 1905 by the Nashville, Chattanooga, and St. Louis Railway and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad.  It operated as a passenger service depot until 1954 when airline travel became more popular and as a freight depot until 1961, at which time it became unused as a station.  The building served as an apartment complex in the 1970s and 1980s until it fell into disrepair.  It was restored in the early 2010s.</dc:description>
