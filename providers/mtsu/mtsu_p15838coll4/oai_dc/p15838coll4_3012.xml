<dc:description>Mount Ararat Baptist Church, located in the Ensley neighborhood of Birmingham, is a locally significant property associated with the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights and the civil rights movement in Birmingham from 1956 to 1963. Baptists associated with the earlier Shiloh Baptist Church of Ensley established Mt Ararat Missionary Baptist Church c. 1915, purchasing the property from the Tennessee Coal and Iron Company.  When the church burned after a lightning strike in 1929, the congregation hired African American architect Wallace Rayfield to design a larger and more architecturally distinctive sanctuary.  Reverend John H. Glover, pastor from 1936 to 1973, expanded the church's education mission and community outreach programs. He was a New Deal reformer and encouraged a spirit of activism in all aspects of church life, including the church's later involvement in the ACMHR. However, Glover stopped allowing the church to participate in the ACMHR meetings c. 1958.</dc:description>
