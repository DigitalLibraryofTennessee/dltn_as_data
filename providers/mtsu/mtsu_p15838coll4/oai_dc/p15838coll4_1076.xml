<dc:description>Hackney Chapel AME Zion Church was built by the African American members of the Unitia community (unincorporated) in October of 1899. The land had been owned by F.R. and M.J. Hackney, African American land owners who donated the land for a church and cemetery. During the early twentieth century life in Unitia centered around the church and the Unitia School, which closed in 1948 due to lack of students. The church added a rear addition in the 1930s, which provided a raised space tor the minister's pulpit and choir; electricity and paneling followed c. 1970, and a picnic shelter with attached restrooms c. 1980. The church remained in business until 1988 when its only two members passed away. The cemetery contains approximately 100 markers, dating to the 1880's prior to the church's construction in 1899.</dc:description>
