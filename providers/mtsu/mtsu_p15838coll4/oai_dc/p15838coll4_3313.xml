<dc:description>History and property description of Old Metropolitan CME Church.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Old Metropolitan CME Church, now Christ Temple AFM Church of God, was established in 1900 and its first building was constructed in 1917. The church is in the heart of the historic African American neighborhood of Ensley, an industrial area in west Birmingham. The church received a major renovation in 1960 and sold in 1967 to a congregation of the Apostolic Faith Mission. Old Metropolitan was one of the leading Ensley churches involved in the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights in the Civil Rights era. It is the only extant historic CME church building still in the Birmingham area that was significantly involved with the ACMHR.</dc:description>
