<dc:description>The Red Clay State Historic Park, located south of Cleveland, TN near the Georgia border, consists of about 260 acres. It is a natural landmark historically associated with the Cherokee Nation, particularly the Council Spring, or Blue Hole, which provided water to the Cherokee during their council meetings.  The park is significant as the last seat of Cherokee government prior to their removal. The last Cherokee capital in Georgia was established in 1826 at New Echota, and was a small sophisticated city that included a courthouse, printing office, houses, and street.  In 1832, the Cherokee were pushed out of Georgia, no longer able to legally congregate.  At this time, the capital of the Cherokee Nation moved to Red Clay in Tennessee and remained there until the final detachments left for western territory in 1838. In 1984, the Cherokee erected a monument to the Trail of Tears, the Eternal Flame.</dc:description>
