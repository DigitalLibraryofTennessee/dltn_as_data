<dc:description>The Matt Gardner Homestead, one of seven Century Farms in Tennessee that was established by an African American, is significant for African-American ethnic heritage, commerce, and architecture. Matt Gardner was born a slave on a North Carolina plantation belonging to a family named Gardner, one of six children born to house servants. His birthdate is believed to be July 18, 1848. After the death of his father, his entire family was sold to a family named Vasser in the Elkton community of Giles county.  After emancipation, in 1870, he married and began to build a life as a preacher, businessman and farmer, having initially acquired approximately 300 acres. Unlike many freed blacks, Gardner was able to hold on to his property through the Jim Crow era. By 1896 he owned 500 acres and was able to build a two-story frame house as well as essential outbuildings, including a storehouse from which he sold goods to his neighbors. Gardner was influential in his community as pastor of the New Hope Primitive Baptist Church and for his leadership in establishing a local school for African Americans ca. 1920 and later for helping to secure funds needed for a four-room Rosenwald school. Rev. Matt Gardner died in 1943 and is buried in the nearby Union Hill cemetery. The farm has continued in the family through ownership of his son, John, and grandson, James. At the time of its listing as a Tennessee Century Farm, the property was owned by Gary Gardener, great grandson of Matt Gardner, Jewel Bailey and Carla Jones.</dc:description>
