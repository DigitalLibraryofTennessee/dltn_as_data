<dc:description>Color photograph of Grassmere. The focus of the front elevation is the Italianate gallery and two-tiered portico with a cross gabled roof. Six wooden steps lead to the porch which rests on stone piers with lattice work infill. Six eight-inch square wood columns and two matching first and fifth bay pilasters support the first floor porch roof. The column pedestals are joined by balustrades which enclose the porch. Four columns, two at each corner, support the central portico projection. Brackets, stretching from the column capitals to the dentil-embellished frieze under the bracketed cornice, form an architrave completing a highly stylized order. The second-story windows rise vertically from the
low-hipped first-floor gallery roof. Instead of a door, the center window provides access to the balustraded portico. Six columns, grouped three at each projecting corner, support the cross gabled roof. A dentil-coursed frieze runs under the boxed cornice decorated with cyma recta moulding on the gable's raking edge. A raised triangular ornament in the center of the gable repeats and emphasizes the shape of the gable. Paired brackets and a den tiled frieze support the second-floor cornice. The main roof and the porch roof of the front elevation have interior gutter systems.

<dc:description>Grassmere is a historic house in Nashville, Tennessee. The present Italianate residence originated as a Tennessee Federal style building. Michael C. Dunn purchased the property of 272.5 acres in 1810 from Alex Simpson and eventually added a hundred acres. This sizable holding enabled Dunn to sell 330 acres of his property to his son-in-law Lee Shute in 1846. The property remained in the Shute family through the Civil War and into the early twentieth century. From 1876 to 1881, the house was remodeled to adhere to Victorian aesthetics. Electricity and plumbing eventually replaced gas lighting. In 1964, Margaret and Elise Croft, the last direct members of the Shute family line, bequeathed Grassmere to the Cumberland Museum (Children's Museum of Nashville later the Adventure Science Center) upon their deaths. Grassmere Wildlife Park opened in 1990, but it closed in 1995 and Nashville Metro acquired the property. Due to the will stipulations of the Croft sisters, the property had to be preserved as a "natural study center." The Nashville Zoo, therefore, relocated to the Grassmere property in December of 1996. In 1998, the home was opened to the public and the farm followed suit by 1999.</dc:description>
