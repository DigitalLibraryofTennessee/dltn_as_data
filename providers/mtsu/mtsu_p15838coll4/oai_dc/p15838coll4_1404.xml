<dc:description>This historic congregation and meeting place dates to the spring of 1865 when Josiah Murray, a local landowner, gave lands to his emancipated slaves for a church and cemetery. The present church building dates to the late 20th century but the historic lodge/school dates to the late 19th-early 20th century.</dc:description>
