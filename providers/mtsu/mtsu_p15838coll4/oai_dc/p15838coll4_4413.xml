<dc:description>Lake Providence Missionary Baptist Church was established in 1868 in the historic African American community of Lake Providence. Reverend Larry Thompson, a traveling missionary, helped organize the church. Through Thompson's leadership, the church's founding families purchased land and formed a close-knit community in the aftermath of the Civil War. The community erected a local school, known as Lake Providence School, that was later destroyed by a fire. A historical marker now stands on the former site of the school, across the street from the Lake Providence Missionary Baptist Church. The original church building, described as a "small box church building," was destroyed by a tornado in 1917. The congregation utilized the local school building for five months until a new church was constructed. In 1931, Reverend Samuel Henry Simpson became pastor of the church. Under Simpson's pastorate, the church paid its mortgage debt within one year and the building was remodeled. In September 1951, the congregation moved into a new church building on the site of the former building. Under the pastorate of Reverend H. Bruce Maxwell, Lake Providence MB moved again into a new facility. At the time of fieldwork, the church building dating to 1989 was still utilized by the congregation. Since fieldwork was completed in 1998, the church has expanded its operation and erected a larger edifice on thirty-six acres about two miles south of the old location.</dc:description>
