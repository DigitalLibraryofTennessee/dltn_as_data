<dc:description>Woodlawn Baptist Church's congregation dates back to at least the early 1850s. It began under the leadership of slave carpenter Harden Smith (1829-1929). The first sanctuary was built in June 1865. Harden was ordained in 1868, after which he held a revival that brought 400 members to the church. Construction began on the initial brick structure in 1870. By 1891, the growing congregation added 2.5 acres to the property. The new addition later served as the location for the present church building. A larger brick building was built 1927-28 across the rod from the cemetery. The ministry of J.A. Caldwell who served 1942-1954 marked a campaign to pay off debts and build a new Sunday School annex. Other ministers include R.W. McClendon (1961-1964), Virgil J. Caldwell (1964-1968), and William Kelly, Jr. (1969-1973).</dc:description>
