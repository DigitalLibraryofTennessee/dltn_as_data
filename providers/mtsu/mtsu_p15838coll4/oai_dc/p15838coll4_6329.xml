<dc:description>Color photograph of the interior of Green Street Baptist Church, west wall, interior of the fa&#231;ade, photographer facing west. This image includes the west-facing gable end, with a partial view of the corner leading to the south-facing gable. The left side of the image includes a wall that extends east and then south to form a corner separating the church's entrance from the sanctuary.  The vaulted ceiling is visible with the flat, coffered section at the peak. The west wall features a round/rosette stained glass window centered below the gable end. Three globe light fixtures suspended on chains are mounted to the ceiling. The left side of the vaulted section has considerable water damage, with plaster largely gone and wood lathes falling in. The corner where the wall meets the ceiling has mold and water damage that extend down to the main floor. The curved, paneled wood balcony with a brass rail extends from the south section of the sanctuary across most of the west gable wall. Access to the balcony is from stairs on the right side of the image, which are partially obscured by a solid, curved, paneled wood wall wrapping around them to the north section (descending to the chancel). A set of folding, theater-style seats upholstered in red sit along the back of the balcony, obscuring all but two of the five arched stained glass windows. The balcony also suffers from considerable water damage, and along the west wall, a section of it has fallen in, creating a sag across the length of the balcony. The balcony is suspended on white round poles extending from the ceiling and a round, white metal column extending up from the floor in the left corner of the image. Three globe light fixtures suspended on chains descend from beneath it, and two of them are partially filled with water. An air duct with vents follows the balcony's underside. A set of white painted wood cabinets are attached to the south wall of the balcony level. On the lower level, the west gable wall includes five matching stained glass windows, with four grouped in the center and one to the left. The lower half of the walls are covered in beadboard wainscoting with a chair rail. A varnished wooden handle extends along the south wall that forms the vestibule. A fire extinguisher and thermostat with its wooden covered open sit on the wall beside the railing. Access from the vestibule to the sanctuary is via set of plain wooden double doors, one of which is open allowing a partial view of the glass door and stained glass transom. The sanctuary floor is covered by dark green carpet, and the wooden pews are upholstered in dark green. An American flag and a Christian flag lay on the front pew facing the chancel, the bases for their poles are below the same pew. Plastic sheeting partially covers the pews on the south end of the church. The right side of the image shows a partial view of the front of the chancel. A dusty podium with an arm to support a microphone sits in the foreground. Another lectern sits closer to the west wall, behind a wooden upright piano with a green-upholstered bench. the white wrought-iron railing by the stairs to the chance platform/stage are partially visible. A gold-framed poster of the ten commandments hangs on the curved paneled wall by the stairs. </dc:description>
<dc:description>The congregation of Green Street Baptist Church formed in 1881, primarily from the congregation of First Baptist Church (Colored), which was then known as the St. Phillip Street Baptist Church (due to their location). The church was led by Reverend John Blevins, who had been pastor at St. Phillip Street, thus the church was originally known as &#8220;The John Blevins Church.&#8221; He remained there for two or three years. On December 31, 1881, church trustees Jefferson Richardson, Joseph Baylock, Adam Clayton, and Henry Lamar purchased a lot on the corner of Green Street and McCreary Avenue (now Griffin Avenue) for $150. The first worship services were held in a store on the corner.  The first church the congregation built was a small frame building on a lot adjacent to wear the brick church now stands. The frame church was small and uncomfortable, unable to accommodate the congregation of 200 souls (with 300 attending Sunday School). The interior of the original structure was lit by three lanterns hanging from the ceiling and a tin lamp on each side wall. The minister had a small platform to stand on, and the children sat on the edge. The original frame building was replaced once by a larger frame church, and again by a brick church, which was dedicated in 1892. The current building was dedicated in 1922. The plan for the building came to Pastor James A. Martin in a dream, and it was designed and built by contractor A.J. Farley. It is a Romanesque Revival church with Italianate influences. Between 1937 and 1946, the church building was renovated and restrooms added. Between 1946 and 1958, the church was renovated again, including the purchase of new pews and floor coverings, and a paved sidewalk was added around the church. In 1946, the church opened a kindergarten, which operated for 14 years. In 1962, the church added an education wing. The late 1980s saw another interior renovation, accompanied by a new roof and renovated restrooms. In the late 1990s, a truss in the church&#8217;s roof failed, which has led to significant damage to the structure, including the bowing of the sanctuary wall on Griffin Avenue, the holes in the roof, and extensive interior damage from exposure to the elements. The remaining congregation currently worships in the education wing.  Green Street&#8217;s current state belies its historical significance. During the 1960s, the church enjoyed a thriving congregation, and its kitchen was used to prepare meals for marchers in the Selma to Montgomery March in 1965. The considerable space in both the education wing and the main sanctuary were also used to provide temporary housing for civil rights workers. On June 5, 1964, the church hosted a mass meeting featuring Ralph Abernathy of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Following the meeting, someone threw a rock at some of the deputized possemen who had surrounded the church during the meeting. The possemen responded by attacking the crowd as it tried to exit the church, using night sticks and tear gas. The riot continued in the neighborhood, injuring many of the black residents and putting some in the hospital. Homes up to a block and a half away from the church were damaged, with broken windows and porch lights. Two white journalists were targeted and their cameras destroyed by possemen.
