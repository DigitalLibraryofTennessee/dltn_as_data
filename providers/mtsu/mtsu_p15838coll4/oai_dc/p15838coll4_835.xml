<dc:description>Built 1925-26, the Lincoln School was a public school for African Americans and the only school built in Bledsoe County with funding from the Rosenwald Fund. It followed the four-teacher school plan specified by the Foundation. The Rosenwald program emphasized self-help and industrial education and the well-equipped school offered a new educational experience to area children. Lincoln School was the only school for African American children in Pikeville until 1965, following the court-ordered end to segregated facilities. </dc:description>
