<dc:description>Color photograph of the entrance and sign of a historic motel.  The motel sign is a great example of 1950s and 1960s roadside signage.  The motel's office is seen on the right.  The brick structure has a large 16 pane window facing Highway 31.  A small former living quarters sits behind the office.  Both structures have hipped roofs with asphalt shingles.  A central entryway leads to the office.  A carport extends out over the drive.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Polk Motel was built in 1947.  The motel is named after President James K. Polk and the Polk family, early prominent citizens of Columbia, Maury County, TN.  The motel was utilized by travelers before Interstate 65 was constructed.  It is a good example of mid-twentieth century roadside motels,  many of which are disappearing from the American landscape.</dc:description>
