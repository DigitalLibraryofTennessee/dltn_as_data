<dc:description>Color photograph of Mt. Zion AME Church building and cemetery. The gable-fronted, concrete-block church contains a tin roof. An auxiliary building, possibly the fellowship hall, sits behind the church. The church's cemetery, located next to the church building, consists of tablet tombstones and other markers dating from the twentieth century.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Mount Zion African Methodist Episcopal Church is a rural African American church in Charlotte, Tennessee. The current building consists of concrete blocks and dates to the mid-twentieth century. The presence of older tablet-style tombstones in the church's adjacent cemetery indicates that an earlier building likely stood prior to the concrete-block one. A frame building sits on the same lot and appears to be used by the church. At the time of fieldwork, Reverend R. E. Corbin served as pastor.</dc:description>
