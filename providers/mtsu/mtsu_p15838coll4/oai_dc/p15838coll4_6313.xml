<dc:description>Color photograph of the north elevation of Northern Heights Presbyterian Church, photographer facing southwest. The length of the church runs alongside Philpot Avenue. This elevation can be divided into roughly three sections: the east end, which comprises the exterior of the sanctuary; the middle section, a single story gable-end section; and the west end, a two-story gable end addition. The length of the church is red brick, though part of the yellow brick facade is visible at the easternmost edge.  The east end of the church includes a single leaf white door near the facade which is protected by an asphalt-shingle awning directly above it which extends around the facade. Two round white columns support the awning. To the right of the door are two small stained-glass windows, one above the other. There are three large stained glass windows separated by brick pilasters. The first window is obscured by a large evergreen shrub. The middle section projects past the east end. The north elevation consists of five bays, each with a single six-over-six double-hung wood window. Between the second and third bays is an air conditioning unit surrounded by a chain link fence. An electrical meter and several wires enter the building between the fourth and fifth bays. There is a single stained glass window on the east elevation with a small shrub planted in the corner where the sections meet. The west end is divided into three bays with six openings. The second and third bays each feature a six-over-six double-hung wood window on each of the two stories. The first bay has a matching window on the second floor with a single-leaf white door with transom protected by a shed-roof asphalt-shingle awning. The church's sign sits in front of the large shrub on the east end, and is trimmed in green with the church's name on top in fixed letters and a changeable black board with white re-positionable letters behind glass below. A chain guard on metal posts runs from the side door to the sidewalk and around to the front door to protect the grass. The stop sign where Philpot Avenue meets Marie Foster Street is visible in the foreground. There is a small paved parking lot between the church and Philpot Avenue. The church's steeple is visible above the gable front of the facade.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The congregation of Northern Heights Presbyterian Church formed in 1900 at the Sylvan Street Presbyterian Church under the Reverend Lucius Deyampert. Deyampert left the church to become a missionary to the Congo under William H. Sheppard, an African American missionary who would later become known for his activism opposing to the treatment of the Congolese by rubber companies. The Sylvan Street Presbyterian Church was the second black Presbyterian Church established in Alabama. The congregation grew through the first half of the twentieth century, and moved to the Northern Heights building in June 1960. This building was originally the Northside Baptist Church. The Sylvan Street Church, located at Sylvan Street (now Martin Luther King Street) and Philpot Avenue, is still extant, though in very poor condition. Like many churches at that time, Northern Heights had an active congregation and hosted many volunteer activities for women and children. The church also operated a kindergarten and low-level elementary school, as did many other black churches. Later, starting in the 1970s, the church operated a daycare center for low-income families for fourteen years. Northern Heights is affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA).
