<dc:description>Dockery Plantation, part of the Mississippi Blues Trail, is considered by many blues music historians as a birthplace of the Delta Blues genre. Dockery Farms was created in 1895 by the clearing and draining of thousands of acres along the Sunflower River in the Mississippi delta region. By the early 20th century it had grown into a self-sufficient community composed of hundreds of tenant farm families, primarily African-Americans. Notable among musicians who worked at Dockery Farms are Charley Patton, Howling Wolf, Tommy Johnson and Roebuck "Pops" Staples.  The site is now managed by a non-profit foundation as public site. A key component is the Dockery Plantation cemetery, where many of the farm's African American workers are buried.</dc:description>
