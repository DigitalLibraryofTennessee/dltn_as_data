<dc:description>Tennessee State University was established in 1912 as the Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State Normal School, the first African-American public institution of higher education in Tennessee.  The land-grant school was built on thirty-five acres with an additional ninety-five acres dedicated for a demonstration farm. It was established by the Tennessee Legislature in the same period that normal schools were established for white students in each region of the state. It's creation also reflects a response to Booker T. Washington's "Tuskegee Idea" for Negro industrial education. A particular emphasis was placed on education of public school teachers.
The three original campus buildings have been demolished. The seven buildings included in the TSU Historic District were  constructed between 1915 and 1949 along Centennial Blvd: Goodwill Manor (1915); Learning Resource Center (1927); Harned Science Hall (c.1927); Jane E. Elliot Building (1932); Administrative and Health Building (1933); Industrial Arts Building (1933); and Engineering Building (1943-1949). Several of the buildings were designed by McKissack and McKissack, a prominent African-American architectural firm in Nashville. All of the buildings were constructed of red brick with limestone elements.</dc:description>
