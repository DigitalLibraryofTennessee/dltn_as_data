<dc:description>The Watson Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, located in Charleston, Tennessee, was established in 1886. The current building reflects two periods of construction: the original 1922 section and a rear wing added in 1988. At the time of fieldwork, Reverend R.E. Sharp served as pastor and the church appeared to be eligible for the National Register.</dc:description>
