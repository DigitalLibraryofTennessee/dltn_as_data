<dc:description>Color photograph of the south wall of the church, photographer facing south. This image includes the south gable end of the church. The ceiling is vaulted up to a flat, coffered section at the peak. A curved balcony follows the walls of the gable end. The lower level floor slopes up to the south wall. The balcony is paneled with a brass rail and suspended from the ceiling on white painted sections with one white-painted metal column supporting it from underneath on either side. The walls include thick crown moulding and beadboard wainscoting with a chair rail. There are five globe light suspended on chains from the ceiling and arranged symmetrically. Four more such lights hang from the underside of the balcony. The south wall features twelve stained glass windows, rectangular on the lower level and arched above, though the ones on the second level are obscured by the balcony. The four in the center are grouped together with the outer windows set further apart. Ductwork extends from the floor to the area below the balcony and follows the underside of the balcony around the church perimeter on the east and west walls.  A ceiling fan descends from the roof to hang level with the underside of the balcony. The walls, ceiling, and woodwork are painted white. Dark green carpet covers the floor. The wood pews are upholstered in a sturdy green tweed and are partially covered with plastic sheeting. Water damage is visible on the ceiling and beneath the balcony, and there is mold damage on the west wall. Debris from the ceiling is scattered over the plastic sheeting. A white speaker is mounted to the balcony on the east and west side.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The congregation of Green Street Baptist Church formed in 1881, primarily from the congregation of First Baptist Church (Colored), which was then known as the St. Phillip Street Baptist Church (due to their location). The church was led by Reverend John Blevins, who had been pastor at St. Phillip Street, thus the church was originally known as &#8220;The John Blevins Church.&#8221; He remained there for two or three years. On December 31, 1881, church trustees Jefferson Richardson, Joseph Baylock, Adam Clayton, and Henry Lamar purchased a lot on the corner of Green Street and McCreary Avenue (now Griffin Avenue) for $150. The first worship services were held in a store on the corner.  The first church the congregation built was a small frame building on a lot adjacent to wear the brick church now stands. The frame church was small and uncomfortable, unable to accommodate the congregation of 200 souls (with 300 attending Sunday School). The interior of the original structure was lit by three lanterns hanging from the ceiling and a tin lamp on each side wall. The minister had a small platform to stand on, and the children sat on the edge. The original frame building was replaced once by a larger frame church, and again by a brick church, which was dedicated in 1892. The current building was dedicated in 1922. The plan for the building came to Pastor James A. Martin in a dream, and it was designed and built by contractor A.J. Farley. It is a Romanesque Revival church with Italianate influences. Between 1937 and 1946, the church building was renovated and restrooms added. Between 1946 and 1958, the church was renovated again, including the purchase of new pews and floor coverings, and a paved sidewalk was added around the church. In 1946, the church opened a kindergarten, which operated for 14 years. In 1962, the church added an education wing. The late 1980s saw another interior renovation, accompanied by a new roof and renovated restrooms. In the late 1990s, a truss in the church&#8217;s roof failed, which has led to significant damage to the structure, including the bowing of the sanctuary wall on Griffin Avenue, the holes in the roof, and extensive interior damage from exposure to the elements. The remaining congregation currently worships in the education wing.  Green Street&#8217;s current state belies its historical significance. During the 1960s, the church enjoyed a thriving congregation, and its kitchen was used to prepare meals for marchers in the Selma to Montgomery March in 1965. The considerable space in both the education wing and the main sanctuary were also used to provide temporary housing for civil rights workers. On June 5, 1964, the church hosted a mass meeting featuring Ralph Abernathy of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Following the meeting, someone threw a rock at some of the deputized possemen who had surrounded the church during the meeting. The possemen responded by attacking the crowd as it tried to exit the church, using night sticks and tear gas. The riot continued in the neighborhood, injuring many of the black residents and putting some in the hospital. Homes up to a block and a half away from the church were damaged, with broken windows and porch lights. Two white journalists were targeted and their cameras destroyed by possemen.
