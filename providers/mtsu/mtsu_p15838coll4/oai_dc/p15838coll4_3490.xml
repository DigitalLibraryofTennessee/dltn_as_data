<dc:description>The Christ Temple AME church congregation originally gathered in 1888, but was rededicated in 1912 by Rev. G.W. Rose as Christ Temple AME Zion. In 1935, it and two other African American congregations were displaced to make room for a New Deal-funded public school. The school board first bought the property of an existing Missionary Baptist Church, which they traded to Christ Temple AME Zion for their location. Although relocated to a new part of town, and with an overall decrease in population, Christ Temple AME Zion continued to play an important role in African American religious and social life. It held homecomings, revivals, and quarterly conferences. It was also part of an AME Zion circuit. In the new location, Christ Temple AME Zion expanded its outreach, establishing a Women's Day program, a Missionary program, and hosting a District program. By the beginning of the twenty-first century, the congregation dwindled to five women. The church closed in 2002 and became an annex of Belmont AME Zion Church.</dc:description>
