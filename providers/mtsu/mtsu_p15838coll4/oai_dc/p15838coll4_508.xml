<dc:description>The Dunbar Rosenwald School was built circa 1923, with support from the Julius Rosenwald Fund's School Building Program. It is significantly associated with African American elementary public school education from the 1920s to the Civil Rights Movement, and was the county seat's only African American public school. It is also an example of the adaptation of Rosenwald standardized plans to the perceived aesthetic needs and wants of a rural community. Two teachers and a principal worked at Dunbar, covering kindergarten through eighth grade. The school became a place for community events throughout the year.</dc:description>
