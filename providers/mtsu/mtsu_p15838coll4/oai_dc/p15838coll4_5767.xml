<dc:description>Color photograph of Bear Creek Community Church's facade. The main entry, framed by a round arch with triple arched radiating voussoirs, is located at the base of the one and one-half story bell tower. Two sets of double leaf paneled doors open onto the recessed porch. Another entrance is located at the southwest corner of the front facade and is topped by a similar pointed brick arch. A brick pilaster is located at the center of the front wall and a decorative string course of staggered sawtooth brick extends around the building below the molded wooden cornice. Two sets of paired lancet windows with three lights each, separated by a kite window, are located on either side of the brick pilaster. A smaller window set of similar design is located in the gable end.

<dc:description>Bear Creek Community Church is located on a two acre lot in Marshall County, Tennessee. Two old cemeteries are adjacent to the property; the original cemetery is located across the road at the top of the small hill and contains headstones which indicate burials from the early 1800s. A deteriorated privy is located on the north side of the church. Built in 1897, Bear Creek Church is one of the finest examples of Victorian vernacular architecture in southern Middle Tennessee. Constructed on a stone foundation, the rectangular brick building features a one and one-half story bell tower projecting from the northwest corner of the gable roof. A pressed metal shingle steeple with crowning finial is the focal point of the church. The Bear Creek Cemetery Association was organized at the church in 1984 to renovate and maintain the graveyards. One year later, the National Park Service recognized the architectural and historic significance of the site to the Mooresville community and western Marshall County by listing the Bear Creek Church and Cemeteries on the National Register of Historic Places. In the fall of 1989, MTSU&#8217;s Historic Preservation Program created a preservation plan for Bear Creek Community Church.</dc:description>
