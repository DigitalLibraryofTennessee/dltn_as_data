<dc:description>The congregation of St. Peter Primitive Baptist Church formed in 1903 and constructed its first building in 1911 at the same location as the present church. By 1943 the congregation had outgrown the original building, which was demolished to allow construction of a brick church of mid-twentieth century Gothic Revival design, creating one of the largest gathering places for African Americans in Bessemer. The expansive new sanctuary allowed the church to have an important role in the development of a capella gospel singing in the Birmingham-Bessemer area. Most notably, the Sterling Jubilee Singers are closely associated with the church.&lt;br&gt;
Rev. William A. Clark, who served as pastor until 1962, led the effort to construct a new church, encouraged the use of the church for gospel programs, and was a supporter of the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights (ACMHR).  The church was among the first to host critical meetings of ACMHR in the years 1956-58.</dc:description>
