<dc:description>History and property description of Canaan Baptist Church.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Canaan Baptist Church is locally significant because of its association as a key Bessemer strategy center during the Civil Rights Movement in Birmingham during the early 1960s.  Established in 1865 by Reverend W.M. Grimes, Canaan Baptist is the oldest African American Baptist congregation in Bessemer. The present church building was constructed in 1961. The civil rights associations lie largely with the leadership of Rev. Dr. J.H. Browder, who was pastor of Canaan Baptist from 1948 until his death in 1964. He and other members were active in Christian Aid Union and Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights in the late 1950s.</dc:description>
