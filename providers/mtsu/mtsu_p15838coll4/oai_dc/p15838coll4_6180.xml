<dc:description>Color photograph of a historic barn on the property of a historic home.  The barn was built circa 1880.  The three bay cantilevered barn features a gabled roof and two side lean-to drive-throughs.  It rests on a stone foundation.  The weatherboard structure does feature board and batten side walls on the drive-throughs.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Rippavilla was built by Nathaniel Cheairs IV.  Construction began in 1852 and commenced in 1855.  Rippavilla and its farmland was the location where General John Bell Hood's Confederate troops set up camp in late November of 1864.  The Union Army marched past the Confederates while they were asleep through the night along the Columbia-Franklin Turnpike, what is now known as U.S. Highway 31.  The house remained in the Cheairs family until 1920.</dc:description>
