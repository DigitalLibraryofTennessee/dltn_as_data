<dc:description>Color photograph of Mt. Zion AME Zion's front  and side view. Two of the church's three sections can be seen. Stone and wood paneled vestibule protrudes from the brick section. Stone decorative shutters flanking multi-paned windows are located to the right of the vestibule. To the left of the vestibule, brick veneer covers a frame section of the church. This section's facade contains a three-part cornerstone and gable vent. The side contains a concrete basement with three sash windows and a door. The side also contains a ground level story with six double-hung sash windows and vinyl siding..</dc:description>
<dc:description>Established in September of 1904, Mt. Zion AME Zion Church provided the African-American community of Louisville with a place of worship and a school. During this first stage of the church's development, Reverend M.M. Morris served as pastor. In 1929, the church was rebuilt under the leadership of Reverend Ella B. Robinson. Yet again, in 1942, the church moved to a new location under the leadership of Reverend M.H. Smith. Due to the many stages of the church's development, the current building reflects different construction periods and materials.</dc:description>
