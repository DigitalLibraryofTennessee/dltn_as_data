<dc:description>Established in 1885, Mt. Olivet Cemetery is the largest, private African American cemetery in Jackson, and is still in use today. It was especially popular with the growing upper middle class and professional segment of the local black community from 1890 to 1930. Based on a 1995 survey of extant cemetery grave markers, the earliest marked burial is from 1885. Prominent burials include doctors, ministers, businessmen, a lawyer, veterans, and many educators. The grave markers also indicate membership in specific clubs, and fraternal and civic organizations, especially those grave markers between 1917 and 1988. The markers indicate particular importance on the graves of children, or "innocents." The cemetery is a symbol of local artisanship, and the success of Jackson's postbellum black community.</dc:description>
