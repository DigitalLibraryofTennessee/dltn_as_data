<dc:description>The Nashville Christian Institute, founded in 1940 and affiliated with the Church of Christ, was a significant factor in African American religious education and Nashville's African American Christian community during segregation and the Civil Rights Movement. It closed its doors in 1967 after the integration of Nashville's schools and the Gymnasium is the only extant structure. An all-black co-educational institution, the NCI educated as many as 500 preachers during its history and served as a gathering place and focus of encouragement for black Christians. The NCI is important due to the school and its famous leader, Marshall Keeble (1878-1968), an African-American evangelist known worldwide for his preaching abilities. Born to former slaves in Rutherford County, Tennessee, Keeble came from a long line of preachers and began his own evangelical career at age of eighteen. The NCI was Keeble's influential base for ministry, evangelism, and education.</dc:description>
