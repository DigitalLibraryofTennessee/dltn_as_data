<dc:description>Chattanooga and the surrounding lands in Tennessee and Georgia were the site of horrific struggles between the Union and Confederacy in the second half of 1863 as each army sought to secure the city. The object of the 1863 campaigns was to gain control of Chattanooga, a city of great strategic importance to both the North and the South. Chattanooga was considered the gateway to the Deep South, and Union strategists considered the control of the city essential to successfully launching an invasion into the heart of the Confederacy.  Chattanooga is located on the south bank of the Tennessee River and is encircled by Missionary Ridge, Lookout Mountain, Raccoon Mountain, and Walden&#8217;s Ridge. This difficult terrain would pose a challenge for both armies and would play a significant role in determining the strategy and outcome of the fighting. Ultimately the Union prevailed, placing Tennessee effectively in control of the Union and clearing the way for incursions into the deep south. The cost in lives was severe on both sides. The battles have been commemorated at the Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park, which straddles the state line, at the Chattanooga National Cemetery and at related sites in the region.</dc:description>
