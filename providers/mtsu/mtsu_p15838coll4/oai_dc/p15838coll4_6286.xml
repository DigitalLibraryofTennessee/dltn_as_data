<dc:description>Color photograph of the northeast corner of Green Street Baptist Church, photographer facing southwest. Telephone wires cross the upper right hand corner of the image. The 1962 education wing occupies most of the image. It is a two story brick structure with a flat roof built adjacent to the east elevation of the original church.  The east elevation of the education wing includes six windows on the upper floor and six on the lower floor, arranged asymmetrically. Moving south to north, the first five windows on the upper level are six-light wood windows with cement sills. The sixth window is a one-over-one wood window with a concrete sill. Moving south to north again, the lower level includes one six-light wood window, four ten-light windows with the bottom four lights painted white, and a six light window, each with a concrete sill. Two gutter pipes extend from the white-painted eaves below the flat roof to the ground, one after the first set of windows, the other after the third. A metal ventilation pipe extends up from the north end of the building, and floodlights are mounted to the corners below the eaves. A small shrub grows against the southeast corner of the building. Two air conditioning units are situated in front of the fifth window on the lower level, with utility boxes fastened to the wall and surrounded by a black metal fence. A gravel drive extends in front of this elevation to the parking lot on the south side. The north elevation forms the facade of the addition. The gable end of the east elevation of the original church is partly visible over the roof of the addition. The education wing's facade is divided into three asymmetrical bays by brick pilasters, with a third pilaster at the northeast corner where it meets the original building. The easternmost bay features a six-light wood window with a concrete sill on each of the addition's two stories. Facing the building in the lower left-hand corner is a cornerstone marking the completion of the education wing. It reads: GREEN STREET BAPTIST CHURCH EDUCATIONAL DEPARTMENT ANNO DOMINI MCMLXII and includes a list of the deacons, secretary, and pastor, whose names are not legible in the photo. A metal gutter pipe runs from the white-painted wood eave to the ground near the pilaster. The central bay features a six-light wood window with a concrete sill on the upper floor and a two-leaf white door on the lower level beneath an asphalt-shingle hip-roof awning supported by white wood brackets. Two brick steps provide access from the sidewalk. Between the window and the awning is a white wood sign surrounded by headers. The sign reads: GREEN STREET BAPTIST CHURCH EDUCATIONAL DEPT. The westernmost bay includes a six-light wood window on the upper level and a ten-light wood window with the bottom four lights painted white on the lower level, each with a concrete sill. On the original building, the north elevation and a portion of the east elevation of the northeast tower are visible. The tower has a pyramid-shaped bonnet roof clad in asphalt shingles with a four-sided spike at the peak. The east elevation, visible over the addition, features brick corbels below the roofline and solid brick pilasters. A pair of louvered arched windows sits in the recessed area created by the corbels and pillars, with a quadruple row of headers and concrete sills. The north elevation also features corbels, but the brick pilasters are split in sections moving down the elevation. There are three rows of openings. The uppermost openings include two arched, louvered windows with four rows of headers and concrete sills. The middle and lower rows each include two arched windows protected by storm windows with concrete keystones, imposts, and sills. Facing the building, the bottom left corner includes a marble cornerstone. A slim portion of the protruding gable end section of the north elevation is visible at the edge of the image, with a view of its damaged asphalt-shingle roof and white-painted foundation with brick pilasters visible between. A sidewalk runs along the building with a grass median between it and the asphalt pavement of Griffin Avenue.  </dc:description>
<dc:description>The congregation of Green Street Baptist Church formed in 1881, primarily from the congregation of First Baptist Church (Colored), which was then known as the St. Phillip Street Baptist Church (due to their location). The church was led by Reverend John Blevins, who had been pastor at St. Phillip Street, thus the church was originally known as &#8220;The John Blevins Church.&#8221; He remained there for two or three years. On December 31, 1881, church trustees Jefferson Richardson, Joseph Baylock, Adam Clayton, and Henry Lamar purchased a lot on the corner of Green Street and McCreary Avenue (now Griffin Avenue) for $150. The first worship services were held in a store on the corner.  The first church the congregation built was a small frame building on a lot adjacent to where the brick church now stands. The frame church was small and uncomfortable, unable to accommodate the congregation of 200 souls (with 300 attending Sunday School). The interior of the original structure was lit by three lanterns hanging from the ceiling and a tin lamp on each side wall. The minister had a small platform to stand on, and the children sat on the edge. The original frame building was replaced once by a larger frame church, and again by a brick church, which was dedicated in 1892. The current building was dedicated in 1922. The plan for the building came to Pastor James A. Martin in a dream, and it was designed and built by contractor A.J. Farley. It is a Romanesque Revival church with Italianate influences. Between 1937 and 1946, the church building was renovated and restrooms added. Between 1946 and 1958, the church was renovated again, including the purchase of new pews and floor coverings, and a paved sidewalk was added around the church. In 1946, the church opened a kindergarten, which operated for 14 years. In 1962, the church added an education wing. The late 1980s saw another interior renovation, accompanied by a new roof and renovated restrooms. In the late 1990s, a truss in the church&#8217;s roof failed, which has led to significant damage to the structure, including the bowing of the sanctuary wall on Griffin Avenue, the holes in the roof, and extensive interior damage from exposure to the elements. The remaining congregation currently worships in the education wing.  Green Street&#8217;s current state belies its historical significance. During the 1960s, the church enjoyed a thriving congregation, and its kitchen was used to prepare meals for marchers in the Selma to Montgomery March in 1965. The considerable space in both the education wing and the main sanctuary were also used to provide temporary housing for civil rights workers. On June 5, 1964, the church hosted a mass meeting featuring Ralph Abernathy of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Following the meeting, someone threw a rock at some of the deputized possemen who had surrounded the church during the meeting. The possemen responded by attacking the crowd as it tried to exit the church, using night sticks and tear gas. The riot continued in the neighborhood, injuring many of the black residents and putting some in the hospital. Homes up to a block and a half away from the church were damaged, with broken windows and porch lights. Two white journalists were targeted and their cameras destroyed by possemen.
