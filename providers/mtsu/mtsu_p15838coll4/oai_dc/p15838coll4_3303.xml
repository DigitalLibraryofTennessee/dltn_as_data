<dc:description>The Readyville Mill was built in 1812 by Charles Ready, a wealthy landowner who was a founder of the Readyville community and lived nearby in his house, "The Corners". A dam constructed at the same time on the East Fork Stones River provided water to power the mill. At the time of its listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, the mill was in operation, producing corn meal and flours. In its current (2013) form, the Readyville Mill complex consists of five restored buildings: mill, granary, icehouse,  cabin, and smokehouse. The mill again produces meals and flours by utilizing an electric mill.</dc:description>
