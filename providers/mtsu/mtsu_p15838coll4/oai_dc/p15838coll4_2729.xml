<dc:description>The Free Hills Cemetery is the oldest historic resource in the Free Hill community that was established by the freed slaves of Virginia Hill in the early 19th century. The community in the Upper Cumberland Plateau became home to additional African Americans  following the Civil War and later was anchored by a community school built 1929-30 with support of the Rosenwald fund.</dc:description>
