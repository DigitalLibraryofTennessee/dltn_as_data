<dc:description>The Wheat Community Cemetery, now the Wheat Community African Burial Ground, was formerly known as Atomic Energy Commission Cemetery #2, the Slave Cemetery, and sometimes as the Gallaher-Stone Cemetery.  Dorothy Moneymaker, in 1979 counted between 90 and 100 graves with no inscribed markers. It is suspected that slaves of the former landowners and other surrounding family farms were buried here; the landowning families include: the Welckers, Gallahers, Burums, Carmichaels, Staples, Henleys, Ellis, and Rathers.  John Henry and Elizabeth Inman Welcker owned and operated a plantation named Laurel Banks possibly as early as 1805, located along the banks of the Clinch Richer where the East Tennessee Technology Park (formerly the K-25) Plant now stands. In 1847, after the Welckers deaths, George Hamilton Gallaher Sr. bought the land.</dc:description>
