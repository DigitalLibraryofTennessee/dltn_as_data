<dc:description>View of the south elevation of the education wing, photographer facing slightly west of north. The education wing is a two story brick structure with a flat roof built in 1962. Over its roof, the octagonal cupola is visible, with a domed metal roof and flat eaves, and an arched louvered window on each face. The top of the northwest belltower's pyramid roof is visible, with the large metal cross at its peak. The spike atop they pyramid roof of the northeast tower is also visible. On the west end, the side of the south-facing gable end section of the original church is visible, clad in asphalt shingles. The concrete top of the gable end extends down to the addition. Directly below it, stepped brick corbels form a bargeboard-esque features just below the roofline. A split brick pilaster extends from the roof, and to the east of it, an arched stained-glass window with a concrete keystone, imposts, and sill is visible over a three-light stained glass window with a concrete lintel and sill. The education wing itself is divided into three asymmetrical bays, the eastmost one being roughly twice as wide as the center and western bays. The western bay features two windows on each floor. The upper floor has a larger six-light window with a smaller two-light window to the right. There are three louvered metal vents, one near on the west end just below the eave, one just below the larger window, and below the level of the larger window but directly below the one near the eave. Conduits travel into this vent, connected to four utility boxes of varying size below. Another meter and conduit run from utility connectors on the upper left corner of the addition down to utility boxes on the first floor. The lower level of the western bay includes a ten-light window with a small, two-light window to the right, matching the one on the second floor. There is a single light opening below the larger window. The bottom four lights of the ten-light window are painted white. Each window has a concrete sill. A green rolling trashcan is parked below the smaller window, and vegetation is growing along the base of the building. The central bay includes a six-light window on the upper and lower floors, each with a concrete sill. The window on the first floor has the bottom two panes painted white. A metal single-leaf door is situated to the right of the first-floor window, and more metal conduit runs along the face of the upper floor. A metal carport supported by four square columns extends the width of the central bay. A hanging fern plant decorates either corner of the carport, and a red outdoor runner rug sits outside the door. The third bay includes a gutterpipe running from the eave to the parking lot beside the pilaster dividing it from the central bay. The on the west end, each floor features a six-light window with a concrete sill. The window on the upper floor opens to a black metal fire escape with stairs extending to roughly four feet from the ground. The window below has its lower right hand pane boarded up. A metal ventilation pipe extends out of the center of the bay up and over the eave. It is rusted at the top and tilts off vertical above the roofline. The east end of the bay includes a wide, two-light window on the upper floor and a six-light window on the lower floor, each with a concrete sill. The lower two panes of the six-light window are painted white. The foreground of the image includes the concrete parking lot, as well as some vegetation and a shrubs visible wrapping around the east elevation. On the left side of the image, a chainlink fence contains refuse in front of the south-facing gable.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The congregation of Green Street Baptist Church formed in 1881, primarily from the congregation of First Baptist Church (Colored), which was then known as the St. Phillip Street Baptist Church (due to their location). The church was led by Reverend John Blevins, who had been pastor at St. Phillip Street, thus the church was originally known as &#8220;The John Blevins Church.&#8221; He remained there for two or three years. On December 31, 1881, church trustees Jefferson Richardson, Joseph Baylock, Adam Clayton, and Henry Lamar purchased a lot on the corner of Green Street and McCreary Avenue (now Griffin Avenue) for $150. The first worship services were held in a store on the corner.  The first church the congregation built was a small frame building on a lot adjacent to wear the brick church now stands. The frame church was small and uncomfortable, unable to accommodate the congregation of 200 souls (with 300 attending Sunday School). The interior of the original structure was lit by three lanterns hanging from the ceiling and a tin lamp on each side wall. The minister had a small platform to stand on, and the children sat on the edge. The original frame building was replaced once by a larger frame church, and again by a brick church, which was dedicated in 1892. The current building was dedicated in 1922. The plan for the building came to Pastor James A. Martin in a dream, and it was designed and built by contractor A.J. Farley. It is a Romanesque Revival church with Italianate influences. Between 1937 and 1946, the church building was renovated and restrooms added. Between 1946 and 1958, the church was renovated again, including the purchase of new pews and floor coverings, and a paved sidewalk was added around the church. In 1946, the church opened a kindergarten, which operated for 14 years. In 1962, the church added an education wing. The late 1980s saw another interior renovation, accompanied by a new roof and renovated restrooms. In the late 1990s, a truss in the church&#8217;s roof failed, which has led to significant damage to the structure, including the bowing of the sanctuary wall on Griffin Avenue, the holes in the roof, and extensive interior damage from exposure to the elements. The remaining congregation currently worships in the education wing.  Green Street&#8217;s current state belies its historical significance. During the 1960s, the church enjoyed a thriving congregation, and its kitchen was used to prepare meals for marchers in the Selma to Montgomery March in 1965. The considerable space in both the education wing and the main sanctuary were also used to provide temporary housing for civil rights workers. On June 5, 1964, the church hosted a mass meeting featuring Ralph Abernathy of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Following the meeting, someone threw a rock at some of the deputized possemen who had surrounded the church during the meeting. The possemen responded by attacking the crowd as it tried to exit the church, using night sticks and tear gas. The riot continued in the neighborhood, injuring many of the black residents and putting some in the hospital. Homes up to a block and a half away from the church were damaged, with broken windows and porch lights. Two white journalists were targeted and their cameras destroyed by possemen.
