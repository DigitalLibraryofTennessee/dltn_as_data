<dc:description>Color photograph of one section of a one-story brick school complex. This principal red brick building with a green cross hipped roof was originally built in the 1920's, but several further additions were made over time. The principal building features a small front gable porch roof. It is flanked by two six-over-six light double hung windows on one side and three similar windows on the other side. The other three entrances each feature a flat porch roof with stairs leading up to a pair of white doors.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Eads School was built with support of the Julius Rosenwald fund. Most of the additions to the property were completed in 1953. The elementary school was used as a clinic for a short period of time, but it was later completely abandoned.  In 2015, the building was scheduled for demolition. </dc:description>
