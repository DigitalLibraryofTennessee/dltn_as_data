<dc:description>Established in 1918, St. Peter Primitive Baptist Church has endured several building phases. The current building dates from 1954 and features a back expansion from 1966. Charles M. Hall School, constructed originally in 1926, once sat across the street from the church. The historic school has been adaptively reused and is now the Alcoa City Center. At the time of fieldwork, A.C. Dix served as pastor.</dc:description>
