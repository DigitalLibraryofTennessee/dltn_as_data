<dc:description>Color photograph of the front (west) facade of a small low-eaved, gable-front building of varitone red brick veneer.  A modern metal-framed double door provides entry to the sanctuary. An awning obscures the church name mounted above the door. The church features white cross mounted on a metal framework that forms a steeple and repeats the cross motif.  Four steps lead to the entrance and an accessible ramp is to the left.</dc:description>
<dc:description>New Rising Star Baptist Church is a small church in the working-class neighborhood of Collegeville in Birmingham. It was established by Rev. George E. Pruitt, who oversaw construction of the church building in 1958 and served as pastor until 1986. The church is significant for its association with African American ethnic identity in the Collegeville neighborhood of Birmingham, and its relationship with Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights (ACMHR). Rev. Pruitt was one of the founders and an executive committee member of ACMHR, and his church hosted strategy meetings for the organization.</dc:description>
