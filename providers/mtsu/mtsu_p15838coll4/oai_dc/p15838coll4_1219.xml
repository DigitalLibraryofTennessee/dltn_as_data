<dc:description>Beth Salem Presbyterian Church, organized in 1866, was the first African-American congregation established in the three-county  area of Polk, McMinn, and Meigs.  Its establishment is a significant example of the impact of white missionaries on Tennessee's religious institutions in the wake of the Civil War. The log church building also served as a public school for African Americans. The congregation used the initial log building until it was destroyed in a fire c. 1920. The building that replaced it is representative of simple, unadorned church buildings during the era of Jim Crow segregation. Regular use of the building for church services ended in the 1950s but the building has been used for community and church gatherings.</dc:description>
