<dc:description>Color photograph of a the 1872 farmhouse. The view is from slightly below the house, which sits on a hill. The distinctive Italianate porch features three sections, each with three carved arches, and is topped by a wrought-iron balustrade. Nine stairs lead to the porch and latticework covers the tall house foundation. The front door of the house is an arched entryway, with one arched window on either side. A projecting bay window is visible on the right (east) side of the house. The roof line has a centered cross gable and diamond vent. Two red brick chimneys are visible near the peak of the red metal roof.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The Cleburne Jersey Farm dates to approximately 1872, when the extant Italianate-styled home and limestone dairy house were built for the Campbell family.  Prior to the Civil War the farm was part of a large plantation belonging to George Washington Campbell. Following the war, the land was divided into the Ewell farm and the Cleburne farm, where McCoy (Mack) Campbell soon built the first herd of Jersey dairy cattle in Tennessee. In the 1880s, the property began to be called the Cleburne Jersey Farm, and in 1885 the dairy herd was significantly expanded.  The Campbell family played a large role in establishing the Jersey as a leading breed of dairy cattle both through breeding and by importing stock from the Isle of Jersey.  At the time of it's nomination to the National Register of Historic Places the farm was still held and managed by members of the Campbell family.</dc:description>
