<dc:description>Color photograph of the side of the brick church with full raised basement. At the right the permastone applied to the front facade is visible. The side is a three-bay sanctuary wall, with a belt course dividing it from the
basement level, which has been stuccoed and painted white. The main sanctuary windows are large painted glass, set in the smaller crossing gabled bays and framed by three rows of header bricks; these windows have a
rectangular lower panel and an upper arched portion with wooden tracery. Smaller editions of these are anterior to them behind the vestibule, while toward the north end are two lancets. Eaves on the sides are deep, with some exposed rafter tails. The basement windows are four-light metal casement windows.</dc:description>
<dc:description>22nd Avenue Baptist Church was one of the leading Birmingham churches involved in the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights in the Civil Rights era. It was also an architecturally significant expression of African-American church design from the first half of the twentieth century and is attributed through church records to the noted African-American architect Wallace Rayfield, who practiced in Birmingham and other Alabama locales in the early twentieth century. The congregation dates to 1878, making it one of the early African-American congregations in North Birmingham.</dc:description>
