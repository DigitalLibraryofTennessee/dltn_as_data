<dc:description>St. Luke AME Zion Church, dating to 1930, was one of the leading Birmingham churches involved in the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights (ACMHR) in the Civil Rights era. Rev. John 0 . Hart, the church's minister from 1960-63, gave spiritual and financial support to Birmingham's Civil Rights struggle, including making the church available for meetings. St. Luke was one of three churches bombed on Jan. 16, 1962. The church was an important strategy center for the Movement in the Project C demonstrations, which were nonviolent confrontational actions intended to provoke response.</dc:description>
