<dc:description>Skyline Farms was a New Deal project of the Franklin Roosevelt administration that aided many farmers and their families in  Alabama during the Great Depression. Located on Cumberland Mountain in northeastern Alabama, it was a resettlement project established to provide jobs and social welfare to unemployed farmers. Subsistence homesteads were a key component of the program along with training programs and development of local industry.  The project served over two hundred families at its height in 1936 and ended in less than a decade later. Skyline Farms also became known for its nationally recognized Skyline Farms Band that was formed by Bascom Lunsford  for the purpose of community enhancement and for the documentary work done there by artist Ben Shahn.</dc:description>
