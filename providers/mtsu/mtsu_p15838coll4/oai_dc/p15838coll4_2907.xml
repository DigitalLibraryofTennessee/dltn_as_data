<dc:description>The congregation of First Baptist Church in East Nashville was formed in 1866 as The Negro First Baptist Church by Rev. R.B. Vandavall. It was one of a number of African American churches that became self-directed after the Civil War. The church met in a variety of buildings in its first decades, was formally chartered in 1882 and constructed its first permanent building ca. 1898. The current church building was constructed between 1928 and 1931. The church symbolizes the growth and development of the African-American community in East Nashville over the course of the twentieth century. It played an important role in the fight for civil rights in Nashville and Middle Tennessee. The church leaders and members participated in local organizations, planned and hosted Civil Rights meetings, activities, and celebration, hosted nationally prominent Civil Rights activists and speakers, and filed lawsuits to achieve equality. The church was a center for political, social, and religious activism in Nashville throughout  the civil rights period, particularly during the pastorate of Dr. J.N. Rucker, 1959-1970.</dc:description>
