<dc:description>Bruce High School has shaped African American youth in Dyersburg for over 100 years. The school is located at the rear of the town&#8217;s historic African American neighborhood, which in turn, is located on the &#8220;opposite&#8221; (west) side of the railroad tracks south of downtown Dyersburg.
As a safe haven for education and community events, Bruce High School, established circa 1900, had extraordinary influence on local African American history until the end of segregation in Dyer County led to its closing in 1966. The present school building only has portions of its 1951 constructed building extant; an earlier two-story brick Rosenwald school was demolished for what was then a modern high school in 1951. Parts of the playgrounds and athletic fields that once surrounded the school also remain. The most important space is the extant gymnasium, which was central to the neighborhood. One of the extant classrooms has been converted into a heritage room that documents the history    of the school and African American life in Dyersburg. Music is also a major legacy of the high school, as the marching band was legendary in its time. The gymnasium still regularly hosts musical events and performances.
