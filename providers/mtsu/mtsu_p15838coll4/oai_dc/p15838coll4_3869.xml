<dc:description>Color photograph of church front and side. It is a modern, concrete-block building. Vestibule of the church contains double doors with nine-paned windows. A single handrail enables access from the steps to the entranceway. Windows on the front of building appear to be painted over and no longer functional for lighting. A door appears on the facade, to the left of the vestibule. Another door appears in an addition on the right side. On the right exterior side of the building, a window remains without paint entirely obstructing the panes. The main building exhibits a cross-gabled roof design. The addition to the right features a gable and shed combination roof. A small, brick chimney juts from the far right of the addition's roof. All three gables in the church contain wooden planks.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Toles Chapel's first meetinghouse originally sat on the grounds presently occupied by the cemetery on Flatwoods Road. The land was purchased for six dollars in February 1907 by Oliver Toles, George Wyly, and Richard McAuley. The congregation eventually relocated to its current building, a former schoolhouse. Built as a Rosenwald-plan school between 1930 and 1940, Toles Chapel CME is a concrete-block building that sits in a well landscaped lot. Sometime after its construction, a small addition with a gable and shed roof, exterior door, and chimney was attached. The historic cemetery at the rear was a principal burial ground for local African Americans and reportedly contains hundreds of unmarked graves. The cemetery landscape has been altered by the movement and rearrangement of tombstones. At the time of fieldwork, Jerry Howard served as pastor and the property was considered eligible for the National Register.</dc:description>
