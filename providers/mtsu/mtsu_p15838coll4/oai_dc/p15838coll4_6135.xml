<dc:description>The A. J. Morton Funeral Home opened in 1891 by J. M. Morton and his wife, Clara B. Morton.  This was the first African-American owned undertaking business in the state of Tennessee.  When J. M. died in 1899, his wife and his son, Andrew J. continued to operate the business.  The funeral home received national attention during the Columbia race riots in 1946.  The funeral home was broken into and one of the caskets was defaced with the letters "KKK."  The funeral home remained in operation until the year 2000.  It ended up being one of the longest operated African-American owned businesses in the United States.</dc:description>
