<dc:description>Color photograph of the sanctuary of Northern Heights Presbyterian Church taken from the altar facing east. The back/east wall is dominated by a mezzanine supported by yellow brick walls that extend from the front of the balcony ledge to the double entrance doors at the rear of the church. The ledge of the mezzanine is solid and covered in the same pine paneling as the wainscoting on the walls of the church. A metal vented unit is visible suspended from the ceiling in front of the south end of the mezzanine ledge. The top edge of the pews in the mezzanine are barely visible over the solid ledge. The glass brick cross beneath the gable end of the rear wall provides illumination. There are two small stained glass windows on the mezzanine level, one on either side, with matching windows on the main floor of the church. Eighteen rows of pews extend from the rear of the church to the elevated chancel. The backside of the pulpit and a microphone on a stand are visible in the foreground of the image, as are the edges of the communion table which sits in front of the chancel on the main floor of the sanctuary. Three large stained glass windows occupy the north and south walls of the sanctuary. The floor is covered in grey composite work carpet. The c1980 drop mansard ceiling obscures a c1940 low-pitch vaulted ceiling. Illumination comes from fluorescent panels in the ceiling as well as a brass chandelier located over the open area between the chancel and the pews. Part of the paneled half-wall surrounding the organ on the north side of the chancel is visible in the lower left corner of the photograph. Two small wall-mounted speakers are visible near the ceiling between the first and second stained glass windows on the north and south walls. Two African American women are seated in the pews facing the photographer.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The congregation of Northern Heights Presbyterian Church formed in 1900 at the Sylvan Street Presbyterian Church under the Reverend Lucius Deyampert. Deyampert left the church to become a missionary to the Congo under William H. Sheppard, an African American missionary who would later become known for his activism opposing to the treatment of the Congolese by rubber companies. The Sylvan Street Presbyterian Church was the second black Presbyterian Church established in Alabama. The congregation grew through the first half of the twentieth century, and moved to the Northern Heights building in June 1960. This building was originally the Northside Baptist Church. The Sylvan Street Church, located at Sylvan Street (now Martin Luther King Street) and Philpot Avenue, is still extant, though in very poor condition. Like many churches at that time, Northern Heights had an active congregation and hosted many volunteer activities for women and children. The church also operated a kindergarten and low-level elementary school, as did many other black churches. Later, starting in the 1970s, the church operated a daycare center for low-income families for fourteen years. Northern Heights is affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA).
