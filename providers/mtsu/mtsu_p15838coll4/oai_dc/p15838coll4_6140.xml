<dc:description>Color photograph of the front facade of a historic home built in the Greek Revival style and  viewed from the west.  The five bay facade features a recessed entryway behind four fluted columns with Corinthian capitals which support the portico.   The house has a stone foundation.  The main entryway is a wooden door flanked by two six-light sidelights and a four-light transom overhead.  The second floor entryway consists of two wooden doors and double screen doors.  A one-light transom light is above the second story doorway.  Two pilasters flank the entryways.  A denticulated cornice runs the length of the facade.  The tin roof is hipped with the exception of the gabled portico, with three brick chimneys extending from it.  Two bays of six-over-six double hung sash windows flank each of the two doorways.  A sunroom is visible on the right.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Rippavilla was built by Nathaniel Cheairs IV.  Construction began in 1852 and commenced in 1855.  Rippavilla and its farmland was the location where General John Bell Hood's Confederate troops set up camp in late November of 1864.  The Union Army marched past the Confederates while they were asleep through the night along the Columbia-Franklin Turnpike, what is now known as U.S. Highway 31.  The house remained in the Cheairs family until 1920.</dc:description>
