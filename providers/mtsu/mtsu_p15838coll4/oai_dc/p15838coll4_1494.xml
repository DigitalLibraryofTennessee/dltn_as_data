<dc:description>Description of the National Trust for Historic Preservation grant funded by Lowe's home improvement store that supported restoration of the school</dc:description>
<dc:description>Free Hills Rosewald School was built from 1929 to 1930. It was a school for African Americans constructed in 
part with funding from Julius Rosenwald, a partner in the Sears &amp; Roebuck department store. The Rosenwald 
Funds were administered by a State board that responded to local requests. The school was located in the
rural Free Hill community near Celina, which was established before the Civil War when a slaveholder from
North Carolina, Virginia Hill, freed her slaves and provided them with land in a rugged, timbered area of Clay County. Like many other Rosenwald schools, Free Hills represented a new commitment by state and local officials to the education of African Americans, though focused largely on vocational training. Importantly, the school also acted as the primary gathering place for African Americans in Clay County and the surrounding area.</dc:description>
