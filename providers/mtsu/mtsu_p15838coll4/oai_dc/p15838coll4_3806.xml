<dc:description>Set originally in a Civil War-era log structure, the Asbury United Methodist Church was called Tate's Chapel after the first pastor, Rev. John C. Tate. A former slave, Tate gained prominence in Anderson County and was elected the clerk of the Circuit Court. The church was founded by a community of freed slaves on Foley's Hill in Clinton, TN during Reconstruction and they appointed Tate as pastor; his name adorned the log church's cornerstone. Officially established on May 29, 1865, the church steadily gained membership, necessitating the construction of a new church. Once again, the church acquired a name from a church official. Dubbed the Asbury Methodist Episcopal Church, the new church building survived until a fire in 1947. The third and current brick building was finished in 1950.</dc:description>
