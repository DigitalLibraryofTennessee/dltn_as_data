<dc:description>The Eads School was built with support of the Julius Rosenwald fund. Further additions were made later, most of which were completed in 1953. The elementary school was used as a clinic for a short period of time, but it was later completely abandoned.  In 2015, the building was scheduled for demolition. </dc:description>
