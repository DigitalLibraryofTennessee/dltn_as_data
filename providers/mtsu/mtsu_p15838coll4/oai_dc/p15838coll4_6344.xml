<dc:description>The Kansas Rosenwald School was built in 1923 for the Kansas community near Gallatin, Tennessee.  The school sat on two acres of land deeded by a man with the surname of Rittenberry to one of his African-American field hands, John Rogan.  The African-American community contributed $450, the white community donated $50, the county government, by law, donated $1000, and the Rosenwald Foundation donated $500.  Members of the Mt. Zion Baptist Church, many of whom attended the school, built a church building upon the property.  The school was built in one of the several styles that were specific to Rosenwald School designs.  It had one room that served first through eighth grades with boys' and girls' cloak rooms and a kitchen.  The exterior was white-washed board and batten style.  the property also included a baseball field.  The community utilized the property for educational, spiritual, and recreational activities for the larger community.  The school ceased official operations in the 1960s during the Civil Rights Movement.  Mt. Zion Baptist continued to use the structure until the 1980s when the building began to deteriorate due to disuse.  The congregation is seeking to preserve the building for church and community functions.</dc:description>
