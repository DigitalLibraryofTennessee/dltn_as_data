<dc:description>Bethel AME Church, whose congregation dates to 1898, was one of the leading churches involved in the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights during the Civil Rights era in Birmingham, particularly in the early years of the organization between 1956 and 1958.  The ministers during the Civil Rights era were Rev. Floyd E. Legg and Rev. Edward Mixon.  William E. Shortridge, a trustee of the church and local insurance agent and undertaker, was the treasurer of the ACMHR from 1956 to 1964. He assumed the administration of ACMHR when Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth left Birmingham and was the target of death threats and an attempted assassination. &lt;br&gt; The church location dates to 1907, when the first church was built on the site. That church burned in 1934 and the congregation was able to rebuild in 1942, with significant modifications done in 1952 and 1996.</dc:description>
