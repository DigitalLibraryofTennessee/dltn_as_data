<dc:description>The congregation of Mt. Zion CME Church dates back to 1870, as it formed soon after the split from the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, which was the largest white congregation then in Obion County, TN. A new church building was dedicated in 1896 to celebrate the first 25 years of the church's existence. The new building was the largest brick structure yet constructed for African-American religious services in Union City. It is the sole, largely unaltered example of African-American constructed Victorian architecture, in its case a Gothic Revival-influenced design, that is extant in Union City. In 1917, the church served as a sponsor and advocate for the construction of a "modern" school for Union City's African-American children, later named Miles School. In the late 1930s, the church added a kitchen and classrooms. These were finished circa 1940. In 1956, in reaction to the growing civil rights movement, national leadership of the CME church decided to change its name from the Colored Methodist Church to the Christian Methodist Church. Mt. Zion followed suit and retains that name today.</dc:description>
