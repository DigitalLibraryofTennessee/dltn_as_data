<dc:description>Color photograph the front and side facades of a one story brick church having seven. The view is from the D Street, with 16th Street to the left. The church has five tall round-head windows that are leaded and with painted glass. A large window of the same style is at the center of the front facade and smaller windows are placed at various levels. Steps lead up to the main entrance of the church and a second door to the lower level is below the main entrance. The single church tower is in the forefront with the view truncated.  The five sanctuary bays are defined by shallow buttresses that rise to the springing of the arches of the round-head windows.  The basement level bays are blind except for bay 6, which contains a metal door with metal canopy.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Bethel AME Church, whose congregation dates to 1888, was one of the leading churches involved in the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights during the Civil Rights era in Birmingham, particularly in the early years of the organization between 1956 and 1958.  The ministers during the Civil Rights era were Rev. Floyd E. Legg and Rev. Edward Mixon.  William E. Shortridge, a trustee of the church and local insurance agent and undertaker, was the treasurer of the ACMHR from 1956 to 1964. He assumed the administration of ACMHR when Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth left Birmingham and was the target of death threats and an attempted assassination. &lt;br&gt; The church location dates to 1907, when the first church was built on the site. That church burned in 1934 and the congregation was able to rebuild in 1942, with significant modifications done in 1952 and 1996.</dc:description>
