<dc:description>St. Luke AME church, designed by Wallace Rayfield and built in 1926, was one of the leading Birmingham churches involved in the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights (ACMHR) during  the key years for civil rights actions in Birmingham. Rev. Andrew W. Thomas, pastor from 1956-1969, was an early activist with ACMHR and opened his church to many of the mass meetings of that group. Among notable speakers at the church were Reverends Fred Shuttlesworth, Edward Gardner, James Bevel, Martin Luther King and Ralph Abernathy.  The church was an important strategy center for planning of Project C in 1963, a campaign of nonviolent confrontational actions, such as lunch room sit-ins.</dc:description>
