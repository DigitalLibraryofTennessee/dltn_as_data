<dc:description>Bear Creek Community Church is located on a two acre lot in Marshall County, Tennessee. Two old cemeteries are adjacent to the property; the original cemetery is located across the road at the top of the small hill and contains headstones which indicate burials from the early 1800s. A deteriorated privy is located on the north side of the church. Built in 1897, Bear Creek Church is one of the finest examples of Victorian vernacular architecture in southern Middle Tennessee. Constructed on a stone foundation, the rectangular brick building features a one and one-half story bell tower projecting from the northwest corner of the gable roof. A pressed metal shingle steeple with crowning finial is the focal point of the church. The Bear Creek Cemetery Association was organized at the church in 1984 to renovate and maintain the graveyards. One year later, the National Park Service recognized the architectural and historic significance of the site to the Mooresville community and western Marshall County by listing the Bear Creek Church and Cemeteries on the National Register of Historic Places. In the fall of 1989, MTSU&#8217;s Historic Preservation Program created a preservation plan for Bear Creek Community Church.</dc:description>
