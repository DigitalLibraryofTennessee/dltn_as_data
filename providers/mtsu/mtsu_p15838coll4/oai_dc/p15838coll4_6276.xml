<dc:description>The Braden-Sinai School was built circa 1920 with possible support from the Julius Rosenwald Fund. It was used as for a Head Start Program and then remained vacant for 18 years. By 1995, it became a residential home and the tall, double-hung windows were replaced with French doors.</dc:description>
