<dc:description>Enon Missionary Baptist Church, located on Walnut Avenue, is one of two Enon Missionary Baptist Churches in McKenzie, Tennessee. It sits in an African American section of town. The other church resides about two to three miles outside of town on Highway 79. According to the fieldnotes, the other church may historically have a white congregation. The church dates from 1912 and underwent remodeling in 1968. At the time of fieldwork, J. Stewart served as pastor.</dc:description>
