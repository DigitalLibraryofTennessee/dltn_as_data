<dc:description>Williamson Chapel was founded in 1850 on the plantation of Richard Mastman as Williamson Chapel Methodist Church, forming an anchor for the Needmore community of free blacks near Old Hickory, TN. The name derives from Richard Williamson, the founding preacher. The congregation left the Methodist Episcopal Church South in 1876 to join the new Colored Methodist Episcopal Church. The original log church building was replaced in the 1890s with a frame building. A lodge hall was built next to the church for the Knights of Pythias in 1920 also served as a school until Needmore Elementary School was opened in 1936. The church building was improved in stages and a modern church building was constructed in 2005.</dc:description>
