A small entrance vestibule projects from the main building, which constructed of weatherboard with a metal roof. A single door has a marquee to the right.  A Tennessee historical marker for the building is on the lawn to the left. The Little Theater is the oldest building on the Fisk campus, having been constructed by the Union Army ca. 1860.

<dc:description>Fisk University was established six months after the end of the Civil War by John Ogden, the Reverend Erastus Milo Cravath, and the Reverend Edward P. Smith. They named the school in honor of General Clinton B. Fisk of the Tennessee Freedmen's Bureau, who provided the new institution with facilities in former Union Army barracks near the present site of Nashville's Union Station. The first classes convened on January 9, 1866. Students ranged from ages seven to seventy, and shared common experiences of slavery and poverty. Strongly affiliated with the United Church of Christ, the institution was dreamed to be  open to all, regardless of race, and that it would be measured by "the highest standards, not of Negro education, but of American education at its best." The educational institution was incorporated into Fisk University on August 22, 1867.  From its earliest days, it played a leadership role in the education of African Americans, producing such traditions as the Fisk Jubilee Singers.</dc:description>
