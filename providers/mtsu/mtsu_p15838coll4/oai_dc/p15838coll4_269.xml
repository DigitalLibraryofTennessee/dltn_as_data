<dc:description>Pikeville African Methodist Episcopal Church was built ca. 1870 and is believed to be the oldest rural African American Church building in Tennessee. At times during its long history it served multiple congregations. The church building also served as a public school, known as Lincoln Academy, that served the Black population of the Pikeville area until the new Lincoln School opened in 1925 with support of the Rosenwald Fund. From its founding throughout the Jim Crow era, the setting and location of the church
 was significant to its association with African-American ethnic heritage. Laying on the east bank of the Sequatchie River, the church was physically segregated from the remainder of Pikeville. It was next -to-town, but clearly not part of town. The church was still in use at the time of its nomination to the National Register.</dc:description>
