<dc:description>St. Mark United Primitive Baptist Church was originally named Spring Hill Primitive Baptist. The church was part of the Big Harpeth United Primitive Baptist Association of Tennessee. On August 31, 1872, the Association convened at Spring Hill Primitive. This means the congregation dates back to between 1866 and 1872. It is likely that the current building was constructed around 1900. It served as a local school for African-American children until Spring Hill Rosenwald School opened in 1920-21.</dc:description>
