<dc:description>In 1806, Dickson County erected a log jail. On May 30, 1830, a tornado destroyed the jail. In its place, a new jail was constructed using materials from the former courthouse. Finished in 1831, the Old Jailer's House originally served as the county jailor's residence. The two-story, gable-roofed brick building witnessed several periods of construction. In 1920, a single-story, one-room brick addition was added to the side. The Colonial Revival porch and cornice details were also added at that time. Around 1940, a single-story, concrete-block jail facility was annexed to the rear of the building. As part of Charlotte's Courthouse Square Historic District, the building (Lot #39, Public Square) is owned by the Dickson County Historical Society. At the time of fieldwork, the society hoped to "utilize the building as a local history museum, to house its archives and collections, and to host special events and exhibitions."</dc:description>
