<dc:description>National Register nomination form for Troy Avenue in Dyersburg, Tennessee.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Located in Dyersburg, Tennessee, the Troy Avenue Historic District consists of properties on the west side of the street between 700 and 1400 Troy Avenue. This neighborhood developed as a result of nineteenth century commercial growth in Dyersburg. The majority of the buildings in the residential district were constructed from 1890 through 1930. The oldest documented house remaining on Try Avenue is the Latta House at 947 Troy, which dates to 1852 and was listed independently on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The Troy Avenue Historic District grew up around the Latta House as an exclusive upper-middle class residential neighborhood for the town's new elite which emerged during the economic boom from 1880 to 1930.</dc:description>
