<dc:description>The Kansas Rosenwald School is located on the Mt. Zion Baptist Church property in Sumner County, Tennessee.  The Kansas community is so named after a group of African Americans migrated west from Tennessee and other parts of the South to the state of Kansas. The school was built in 1923 on property just off Kansas Lane, an historic road&#8212;an old buffalo trail&#8212;that leads to Highway 31. Before the construction of the Rosenwald School, Mt. Zion Baptist Church functioned as both a church and school. After the Rosenwald School was built, the church was still affiliated with the school. The church used the school building as a fellowship hall until the 1980s. In the spring of 2014, the MTSU Center for Historic Preservation conducted a preliminary preservation assessment for the Kansas Rosenwald School.</dc:description>
