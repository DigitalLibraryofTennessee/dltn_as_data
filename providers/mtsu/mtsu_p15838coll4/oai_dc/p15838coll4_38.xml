Dear Dr. Van West:
I regret to inform you of a very unfortunate event on the site of the former Allen-White School in
Whiteville, Sunday Morning May 20, 2012 at approximately 2:30A.M. a fire completely destroyed the
structure that was the Rosenwald Building on the Allen-White Campus. It is obvious that Arson is the
cause since there has been no electricity to the building in recent years.
As you can imagine this is devastating to the community and those interested in the preservation and
restoration of the property. I am enclosing a picture of the burning which is part of a flyer announcing a
reward for information about the incident.
I know that we are on your itinerary for August in Whiteville; however this incident totally alters the
tenor of our discussion. I hope that this does not alter your plans and that you and staff may provide
some advice/consultation regar9ing future direction. As you can see from the picture the destruction is
massive. Any advice in the interim would be welcomed.
Thanks for your interest.
Sincere regards,
Evelyn C. Robertson, Jr.
