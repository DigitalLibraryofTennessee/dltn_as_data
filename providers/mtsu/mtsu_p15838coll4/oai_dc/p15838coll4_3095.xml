<dc:description>22nd Avenue Baptist Church was one of the leading Birmingham churches involved in the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights in the Civil Rights era. It was also an architecturally significant expression of African-American church design from the first half of the twentieth century and is attributed through church records to the noted African-American architect Wallace Rayfield, who practiced in Birmingham and other Alabama locales in the early twentieth century. The congregation dates to 1878, making it one of the early African-American congregations in North Birmingham.</dc:description>
