<dc:description>Golden Hill Cemetery is significantly associated with the development of the African American community of Clarksville, Tennessee. It was established on land purchased by Stephen Cole, a former slave, in 1863, and is believed to be the oldest tract of land continuously owned by African Americans in Clarksville.  Incorporated in the 1880s, Golden Hill Cemetery is also considered to be the first corporate business owned by African Americans in Clarksville.  The grave of Stephen Cole is an example of one of several graves of veterans buried at Golden Hill, along with several members of the local 101st Regiment of the United States Colored Infantry.  In the 1880s, Cole sold the cemetery to John W. Page, one of the most prominent members of Clarksville's African American community at the time.  Distinctive to the cemetery is stone carving of Hiram Johnson, an African American man who lived with white merchant and owner of the Clarksville Marble Works, Samuel Hodgson.  After the death of cemetery owner Mattie Page in 1929, the Golden Hill preoperty and 80 shares of stock in the cemetery were sold to William Keesee, a local undertaker. The property passed to his wife Jennie Keesee in 1933, and she sold it in 1947 to Albert Roberts for $1.00. Reverend Wiley Blount Moore, purchased the property in 1996.</dc:description>
