<dc:description>Pearl School began in 1883 as a grammar school on present day Fifth Ave South. It remained in that area, known as "Black Bottom," until 1917 when the student population outgrew the building. Pearl High School was the second public African-American high school in Nashville. It became an educational center for the fine arts, music, and sports after some architecture additions in the late 1930s. Its first graduating class was in 1898.  Pearl High also was one of two major black schools in Nashville built with Public Works Administration funds during the New Deal of the 1930s. In late 2001, the school changed its name to Martin Luther King Magnet at Pearl High School.</dc:description>
