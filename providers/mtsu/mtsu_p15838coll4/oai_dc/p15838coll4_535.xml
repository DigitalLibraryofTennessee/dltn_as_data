<dc:description>Clinton, TN was the site of the first successful desegregation of a state-supported high school in the south following the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in 1954. Twelve students from the Green McAdoo School  walked together to Clinton H.S. to register for the 1956-57 school year. While the decision was accepted by many in Clinton, threats of violence led to the first use of National Guard troops to enforce desegregation. Complete desegregation was not achieved until 1965. The school closed at that time but was then used for the Head Start program.&lt;br&gt; Green McAdoo exemplifies the 1930s concept of a neighborhood school. Originally  named Clinton Colored School, the name changed  in 1947 when a wing was added. The school was named for Green L. McAdoo, a valued employee of the Anderson County Courthouse who had served in the Buffalo Soldiers as part of the Army's 24th Infantry at the end of the 19th century. Green McAdoo Grammar School became the leading educational facility for African American students in Anderson County. And as a community institution, it was a center for the Civil Rights Movement in Anderson County. The school became the Green McAdoo Cultural Center in 2006.</dc:description>
