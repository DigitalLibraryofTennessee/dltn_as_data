<dc:description>Color photograph of a historic home viewed from the north.  The west elevation of the main brick home features seven bays. Four six-over-six double-hung sash windows are located to the left of the side entrances on both floors.  The first floor entryway has a wooden door with sidelights and a four-light transom window.  Two pilasters flank the entryways.  Two more six-over-six double-hung sash windows are located to the right of the entryways.  A large portico covers the entryway with four columns topped by Doric capitals.  The kitchen and smokehouse can be seen to the left in the background.  A small fountain sits in the foreground.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Rippavilla was built by Nathaniel Cheairs IV.  Construction began in 1852 and commenced in 1855.  Rippavilla and its farmland was the location where General John Bell Hood's Confederate troops set up camp in late November of 1864.  The Union Army marched past the Confederates while they were asleep through the night along the Columbia-Franklin Turnpike, what is now known as U.S. Highway 31.  The house remained in the Cheairs family until 1920.</dc:description>
