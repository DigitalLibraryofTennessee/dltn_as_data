<dc:description>Located on land adjacent to and east of the Hermitage, Tulip Grove is a classic example of vernacular Greek Revival architecture. Its claim to distinction is that it was built by Andrew Jackson Donelson, nephew of Andrew Jackson. Construction of the mansion began in 1834 under the supervision of its architects, Joseph Reiff and William Hume. The original classical styling includes a very solid Doric portico, columns, and decorative elements. While the original elements are intact, later owners made some cosmetic modifications that little affected the house's core. These post-1858 changes reflect the rise in Victorian tastes. After eight subsequent owners, the Ladies' Hermitage Association acquired the property in 1963. A historic structure report for Tulip Grove was prepared by historic preservation students at Middle Tennessee State University in 1983. In September 1996, the Hermitage and the MTSU Center for Historic Preservation reached an agreement whereby the Center would conduct basic recordation and dating investigation of two log buildings that during the late 1960s had been relocated to an area near the Tulip Grove house parking lot. This work constituted a mitigation effort to produce appropriate documentation of the two buildings prior to their planned demolition.</dc:description>
