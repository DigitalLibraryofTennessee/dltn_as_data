IN
MEMORY
of
ZADIE BOWLING KEY
(Octoljer 20, 1921 - August 30, 1992)
Publication 34 is dedicated to Zadie B. Key, a longtime
member of our Society, whose contributions were many and
varied. She served four terms as Treasurer, from 1988 to
1992. Prior to that, she was editor of the newsletter and
served on several committees, such as Historic Preservation,
Sales, and Membership. She was also a member of our
Executive Board. Zadie was a people-oriented,
community-conscious, caring individual who strived to make a
difference. The Rutherford County Historical Society is very
appreciative of her efforts and dedication to our
organization and consider it our privilege to honor her in
this small way.
