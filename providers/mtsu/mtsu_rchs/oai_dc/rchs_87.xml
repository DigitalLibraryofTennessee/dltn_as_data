RUTHERFORD COUNTY HISTORICAL SOCIETY
PUBLICATION NO. 2
Winter, 1973
THE COVER: The request for bids for building Rutherford
County a courthouse that appeared in the Nashville Whig , Novem-ber
25, 1812, was most intriguing. So much so that the idea was
suggested that an architectural rendering of the proposed building
be attempted. In cooperation with the Historical Society, Mr.
Charles Pigg, Plant Planner for Middle Tennessee State University,
contacted Yearwood and Johnson, Nashville architects. The firm
was amenable to the project and assigned Mr. John E. Suter, a
longtime draftsman of the firm, to the job. The sketch on the
cover is the result of Mr. Suter 's efforts. A re-reading of the
specifications printed in "Publication No. 1" will bear out the
faithful and imaginative adherence to the Whig '
s
descriptive
notice of 1812.
Was the building ever constructed? If Goodspeed is accepted
as the authority, it was not. Yet Goodspeed has perpetuated many
errors and contradictions in light of later research. If it were
not built&#8212;possibly because of the cost&#8212;Rutherford County made
its initial salute to conservatism and frontier economy. If it
were built, the loafers and hallway philosophers were in first
class quarters.

PUBLICATION NO. 2
FOREWORD
There seems to be a semblance of permanency in a bound
document that has an identifying cover. With this in mind
the Society hopes to preserve some of the rich historical
heritage that abounds in the county. This, therefore, is the
principal purpose of this publication and the one that preceded
it. Hopefully, there will be others.
The resources of the Society do not permit technical
preparation of successive volumes by a professional printer.
However, mimeographed material locked in by a printed cover
will serve the purpose&#8212;at least for the time being.
All members of the Society will receive a copy of the
publication, and those that follow, as a part of the membership
dues. Revenue derived from the sale of extra copies will pro-vide
some assurance of the continuity of the publications.
We express our thanks to those who have purchased one or
more copies of this issue. Your assistance will enable us to
continue our project.

BOOKNOTE:
Historic Cane Ridge and Its Families , a 1973 publication by
Mrs. Lillian Brown Johnson, is due to come off the press late this
year. It is listed in the Library of Congress under No. 73-85673.
The price is $20 plus $1 for tax and 75C for mailing and handling.
This is a combined history and geneological records of the
early settlers of District 6, Davidson County. The work was begun
by Mrs. Johnson when she started research to complete an appli-cation
for her husband, Buford Boyd, to become a member of the
Sons of the American Revolution.
She contacted residents of the area and found so many of those
presently living that knew their families had lived in the area of
the Cane Ridge Presbyterian Church for several generations, and
they were interested in knowing more of the history of the early
settlers, so she continued her research until she has completed a
4 50-page book containing over 1500 surnames and hundreds of given
names. The book contains church as well as family records and is
sure to be of interest to all who have been a part of this area of
our state. There are descendants of seventeen Revolutionary Patriots,
such as Austin, Baker, Boaz, Gray, Johnson, Peay, Gambill, Thompson,
and others.
The book is indexed and contains over one hundred pictures.
It is being printed by Blue and Gray press, and it will be
available from the writer, a resident of Smyrna.
