<dc:description>RUTHERFORD COUNTY MILITIA COMMISSIONS
Prepared by Henry Wray
From records of Commiasiona of Officers in the Tennessee
Militia, 1796-1811, Volume 1, from a compilation by Mrs.
John Trotwood Moore, one time State librarian.
Under the Militia Law of 1803, the general assembly
adopted a numerical system of identification, assigning a
number to each regiment, in each county, again however
these regiments were known locally as the First regiment
of the county, etc. The two regiments in Rutherford County
were known as 22nd and i+Sth regiments. The 2nd or 45th was
organized in 1811.
This list undertakes to include all the commisaiona
issued to Militia officers during the first three terms of
Governor John Sevier. The volume which apparently covered
the years 1801-1806 has not been found. Thus the first
years of Rutherford County are missing and start with 1807.
