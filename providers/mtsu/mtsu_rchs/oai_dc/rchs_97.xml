FOREWORD
People, Places, and Events make History.
In wishing to preserve, and make easily accessible
many facts concerning the rich heritage of Rutherford
County, the Historical Society presents Volume I.
Many hours of research into historical records have
been spent in preparation for this volume, in order to
compile and organize information concerning outstanding
people, the marriage records from 1851-1853, and
descriptions of places which have played an important
part in the historical background of Rutherford County.
This volume is presented with the hope that it will
aid in helping individuals in research, and develop greater
appreciation for the historical background and heritage
of Rutherford County.
