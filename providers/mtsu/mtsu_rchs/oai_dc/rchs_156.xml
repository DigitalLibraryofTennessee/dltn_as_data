AN 18 03 "CENSUS" OF RUTHERFORD COUNTY
By Robert M. McBride
Rutherford County, Tennessee, was established by an act of
the General Assembly on October 25, 1803, from portions of
Davidson and Williamson Counties, and organized on January 3,
1804. The first census of the county is that of 1810, in which
year there were 1,141 heads of families living in the county
.
The only known listing of residents of the county at the
time of its creation is a petition dated August 10, 1803, from
residents of Davidson and Williamson Counties, praying for the
creation of a new county. Some 256 persons (plus a few others
whose signatures are illegible) signed the petition.
^
This document is not, of course, a complete list of resi-dents.
A month later, a number of other residents of Davidson
and Williamson Counties petitioned that a new county not be
established, as they wished to remain in the parent counties.
However, the signers of the first petition represented probably
at least half of the residents in what became Rutherford County.
If those who opposed the new county, plus those who signed neither
petition, were approximately the same number as those favoring
the new county, then there were perhaps six hundred householders
in the area. If the average size of a household was five persons,
then the area included perhaps 3,000 inhabitants in 1803.
^Rutherford County is the only county of Tennessee for
which the 1810 census is in existence.

Most of the petitioners lived in the Stewart's Creek-Stones
River area, centered around Jefferson, the oldest settlement in
the county. Some lived at a greater distance toward the future
Murfreesborough and as far as the present Cannon and Bedford
3 Counties.
The restlessness which characterizes a pioneer and migratory
society is well illustrated by a comparison of this list with
the official census of 1810, seven years later. Many of the
families listed in 1803 are still identified with Rutherford
County; many others had disappeared, indicating that they soon
became citizens of newer counties to the south of Rutherford, or
removed further west. It also indicates the rapid settlement of
the area during the decade of 1800-1810. In 1803, many families
who are well-known in the history of Rutherford County had not
yet made the long trip across the mountains from Virginia and
the Carolinas, or from the older settled areas of Tennessee;
their connection with the county began after&#8212;though only shortly
after&#8212;the petition of 1803.
The petition requesting the establishment of Rutherford
County reads:
To the Honorable, the General Assembly of the State of
Tennessee.
The petition of a number of the citizens of Davidson &amp;
Williamson Counties humbly sheweth that the vast extent
of said counties renders it inconvenient for your
petitioners to attend Courts, General Musters, Elections,
etc. at the towns of Nashville &amp; Franklin, &amp; there
A few were along the southern border of the state, in
Indian territory, for example the Bean family, of the present
Franklin County.
54
being a sufficiency of territory agreeably to the
Constitution, to form a new county within the bounds
hereafter to be described &amp; leaving constitutional
quantities within the bounds of the old counties.
We your petitioners therefore pray that you will
consider our situation &amp; grant us a new county with
the following boundaries, viz: beginning on the
top of a ridge dividing the waters of Stone's River
&amp; Mill Creek, in the Williamson County line, &amp; run
southwardly with said ridge so as to leave all the
waters of Mill Creek &amp; Harpeth in Williamson County,
until the ridge intersects the now Eastern boundary
of said Williamson County;- thence continue South
with said line of Williamson County to the South
boundary of this State;- thence with the line of
Wilson County North &amp; Northwestwardly continuing
with said county line to an Elm and white ash, the
corner of said county, which is North East from the
mouth of Hurricane Creek, which is four miles &amp;
thirty six poles; thence from the mouth of Hurricane
Creek Southwest to the top of the first mentioned
ridge; thence with said ridge Southwardly to the
beginning. And your petitioners, as in duty bound,
will ever pray.
August 10, 1803
