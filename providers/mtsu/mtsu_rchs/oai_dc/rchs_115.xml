<dc:description>THE RUTHERFORD RIFLES

County, Tennessee CEMETERY RECORDS" published 1971

(Manuscript found in papers of Caroline K. Burrus.)
The Rutherford Rifles (Company I, 1st Tennessee Infantry)
was organized in Rutherford County with William Ledbetter, Jr.,
as captain. They spent one week in daily drills in and about
Murfreesboro. On May 2, 1861, they met on Depot Hill to
leave for Nashville, where they arrived at 11 a.m. They
marched around the square in Nashville to the tune of "Annie
Laurie." They were mustered into Confederate service on
August 1, 1861. The outfit fought at Shiloh, Murfreesboro,
Chickamauga, Kennesaw Mountain, the Atlanta campaign, and in
Hood's invasion of Tennessee.
Alfred Horsley of Columbia, Tennessee, wrote of the
Rutherford Rifles: "The Butlers of our regiment were fine
soldiers. Jack, captain of the Railroad company, and Joe,
his brother, lieutenant, refined and handsome as a woman,
but brave as Caesar, literally shot to pieces at Perryville,
Dock of the Rutherford Rifles, in stature like a Roman
gladiator, shot at Missionary Ridge. For years we had seen
-43-
-44-
his grand Apollo-like form in the front of the Rutherford
Rifles, rendered more majestic by comparison with the
diminutive form of captain "Doc" Ledbetter. No matter how
dark the night or how long the march, when the "imminent peri-lous
edge of battle" was in sight, the Rutherford Rifles
always had a long battle line and "Doc" Ledbetter was at the
head. I often recall him and his company, as they appeared
before battle. I think you will concur with me in saying
the Rutherford Rifles was the best company in the 1st
Tennessee Regiment. Sam Davis who died at Pulaski rather
than betray a confidence was a member of the Rutherford
Rifles... If all the men in the Southern army had been like
the Rutherford Rifles, we could have camped on the shores
of Lake Erie instead of the Chattahoochie. My memory is a
picture gallery in which is seen this splendid company of
men at the moment of battle&#8212;all others looking like skeletons,
but the Rutherford company of men, a long line of tall,
majestic men. Caesar would have placed them in his "Tenth
Legion" or Napoleon in his "Old Guard." The Ransoms, the
Wades, the Kings, the Bezles (Beazles) , the Jarrats were
all grand men, but like Saul, "Doc" Ledbetter rose proudly
preeminent above them all, and poor Hardy Murfree, the best
of men, his memory is worthy to be honored with the tears
of all good and brace men. All honor to Rutherford County."
