RUTHERFORD COUNTY HISTORICAL SOCIETY
PUBLICATION NO. 10
FOREWORD
The founding fathers and mothers of the Rutherford County Historical
Society were motivated by one overriding desire: to create among Ruther-ford
Countians an interest in the heritage of their community. Of course
there were important subsidiary reasons, the social factor not being the
least. Many people in the community have been brought together vdth his-torical
common interest being the vehicle. It should be said that the
profit motive has been one of the least of the motivators. However, the
Society has experienced remarkable solvency during its existence. One of
the most recent projects, the reprinting of Henderson's Storjr of_ Murfrees-boro
. is a case in point. Publication costs v;ere $4&#187;25 per unit in ad-dition
to the inevitable exigencies of sales tax. The marketing price was
and is $5,00 per copy. Despite this, the magnanimity of Jesse C. Beasley,
Jr,, enabled the Society to distribute the rare volume with a minimal
mark-up and, thus, to show a handsome profit. As a result, revenue has
been generated from this and other ventures to finance additional projects
and to inprove the semi-annual publications.
The series of features that appear in this the tenth publication
place historical subjects of community interest in a permanent binding
for enjoyment now and in the future. Not enough can be said for the ef-forts
of dedicated Ernie Johns in collecting and preparing for publication
the materials that appear here and in those of the past. The Society owes
him a deep debt of gratitude.
