RUTHBRFQRD COtWTY HISTCRICAL SOCIETI
hy &#8226;&#8226; E* K* JotBi8
Rutherford Count7 tiled to begin a Historical Society on Septetnber
2, 1966 when Dr. Homer Pittard County Historian, called a meeting at
Middle Tennessee State Ibiversity Arena Theater. TMenty-four iwrsons
attended the first meeting, and elected officers and discussed suggested
projects. No other meetings were held hj this groiq) according to our
records. HoHever, the interest was there in our county for a Historical
Society*
On December 17, 1970 Dr. Homer Pittard called another meeting in
Room 208 at the Middle Tennessee State lliiversity Administration building.
Ei^t people attended this meeting and the third Monday of each month
was agreed on as a meeting night. Regular meetings, programs, dues and
working officers got things rolling. Within a few months Mr. Henry Wray
was elected president azvl l^-laws were adopted. Dues were favor dollars
for charter meinbers and five dollars for other meobers.
The County Court was asked to s^polnt an Archivist, and Mr. Henry
Wray was chosen for this position. He soon began collectdLng historical
material In a file cabinet and started publishing historical articles in
the Daily News Journal, Sunday edition.
At the May 1972 meeting Mr. Wray was asked to act as editor for a
publication similar to the one Williamson County was publishing. The
first publication was issued in July 1973. Since that time they bave been
Issued twice each year-in July and January. Mr. Henry Vray continued the
job of assembling the publication for four more issues. He then moved to
California and Smest K. Johns was assigned this responsibility.
76
On May 20, 1973 a field trip was talnQ to the HUoknan eoiiiiininll7
led by Mr. Bob Baskla and Mr. Fred Briganoe. Other field trips later
were to KlttreU, Readyville, and to Soyma, Lascassas, Stones River
Battlefield- Murfreesboro&gt; Cannonsborg, Trltme and Tennessee State
Miseum. A school bus was used for the field trips.
In May 197U the Historical Society published the l8U0 Census of
Rutherford County. This was the first extra publication Issued for
sale axKl not given out as part of the dues. Later in 1977 &gt; C C.
Henderson's History of Murfreesboro was reprinted. An Index to the
first five publications, by Dottle Matheny was published in 1979. The
Carlton Sims History of Rutherford Counly was reprinted in 1981. These
extra publications also include the three volumnes of cemetezy records
published jointly with the Sons of the American Revolution, in 1975*
These publications have added conaideral:^ to our treasury.
At the December 197U meeting the first commemorative plate was
Issued. The first plate featured the county covurthouse. W. H. West-brooks
was responsible for this project. The first order was r&#163;^dly
sold and more plates were ordered. Later, a second plate with a different
view of the old courthouse was Issued. Then, a plate featuring Tennessee
College was ordered. These plate sales contributed a nice addition to
our treasury.
In Ncjvember 1975 Mr. Bruce HLunner offered the Rutherford County
Historical Society the rl^t to sell a bank made as a repUca of the
courthouse. Then, in February 1976, a bicentennial medallion was pro-posed.
The medallions cost ninety-seven and one-half cents and were sold
for one dollar. These medallions sold very weU and in June of 1976,
another 1,000 were ordered. The second order had on the back the obelisk
pictured instead of an eagle and sold for two dollars.
77
Id. January 1975&gt; a motion was made and passed &gt; that the Society
Incorporate. A charter was obtained frcaa the State of Tennessee. In
i^rll Ey-laws were adopted by the Rutherford County Historical Society.
Also&#171; in June a post office box for the Society was obtained.
An obelisk at the geographical center of Tennessee wais taken as a
project by the Society on October 1975. Mr. Thomas Steagall donated
the rock used in the construction. The obelisk was dedicated on J\xne
26, 1976.
The Historical Society has also been active In recording oral history,
microfilming and preserving old wills in the courthouse, purchasing new
books and reblndlug older historical books in Luiebaugh Library, assist-ing
in the Diorama at Caxmonsburg, and other historical projects.
The Rutherford County Historical Sodely began meeting at Middle
Tennessee Iftiiversity in the Administration building until December 1971.
Prom February 1972 until May 197U the Council Chambers of the Murfrees-boro
City Hall were used, and a place provided for the files assembled by
the archivist. Then in July 197U, we moved to the new Murfreesboro Police
building. The meetings were held in the court room. An office for the
files and storage of extra publications was provided. The dty police
departments &#187; need for the office space made it necessary to move to the
city garage b\illding in the fall of I98O. The building located on west
lnfl^^n street has a nice meeting room and office space.
The Rutherford Counlgr Historical Society was modeled after WnHam-
Bon Co\mty Historical Society when it was organized. The Society has
been successful for the first ten years because of some of the following
listed reasons:
1. The Society has been financially strong, due to extra
publications, plates, medallions and banks
78
2. The officers and board meonbers have been actlTe. The
officers are asked If th^ will serve before their
election
3. Credit has been gLven to the ones responsible for their
work
1|. The County and City governments have been ver^r cooperative
5* Members of the Society have not been required to attend
meetings, or be qualified in aiiy way. The only require-ment
for membership has been to pay their dues, and these
cover the cost of the meeting notices and publications
6. The Society has been active in publicaticn, preserving
and distributing historical material on Rutherford County
7. The Historical Society has tried to cover all of Ruther-ford
County's history, and not just Murfreesboro or
certain families.
8. The Socie-ty has held monthly meetings which provide a con-tinued
effort on projects, and keep Interest arovtsed.
