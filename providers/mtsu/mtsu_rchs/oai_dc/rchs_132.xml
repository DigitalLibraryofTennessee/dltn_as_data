The Cover - This home, constructed in 1868 by Asa
Houston Sanders and subsequently known as the Fate
Sanders home, was abandoned when the Percy Priest
Dam Reservoir was established. Before demolition
crews moved into the area, vandals struck and the
house was burned. It was located on land adjacent
to and north of the former Sewart Air Force Base
and near the Fate Sanders Boat Ramp. The sketch
was prepared by Adock. Those who were associated
with the house do not recall the first name of the
artist nor the circumstances leading to the prepa-ration
of the sketch.

FOREWORD
On December 17, 1970 the Rutherford County Historical Society
was reorganized with eight people present. Since that time we have
grown to over 150 members dedicated to preserving and publishing
the history of Rutherford County for future generations to enjoy.
Our publications have been subscribed to by people across America
and abroad.
With outstanding monthly programs the Society continues to
grow. On our lOth. anniversery, in 1980, we expect to be the lar-gest
and most progressive historical society in Tennessee.

DEDICATION
Publication No. 6 is dedicated to Mr. Henry G. Wray formerly of
Smyrna and now living in California. He was the First president of
the Rutherford County Historical Society and served as the County Ar-chivist.
The first five issues of the Rutherford County Historical
Society Publications were due to his efforts and time. He worked
many hours and traveled extensively over Rutherford County from 1969
until the spring of 1975 helping assemble the data for the three vol-umes
of cemetery records on our county. During this time he also aided
many people in their quest for genological data. During 1973 and 1974
he contributed a short article each week on the county history to the
Sunday Daily News Journal. Besides these tasks Mr. Wray was involved
in numerous other projects related to Rutherford County and its history.
Henry Gobel Wray was born August 11, 1905 in Nashville, Tennessee,
the son of Granville Moody Wray and Amelia Gobel Wray. His father was
born in Williamson County. His grandfather was Richard Robinson Wray
of the Almaville area of Rutherford County. Henry Wray was also a
descendant of the Haynes and Robinson families of early Rutherford
County.
In 1909 Mr. Wray's parents moved to Birmingham, Ala. and he was
raised there. He attended the public schools in Birmingham until 1920,
when he enrolled at Castle Heights Military Academy at Lebanon for the
last two years of High School.
He began work in 1922 with the engineering department of the Ala-bama
Power Company. In 1924 he moved to Washington D.C. and was employed
by the Federal Government while he attended Law School there. In 1926
he returned to Birmingham to the Alabama Power Company and was married
in 1927.
Mr. Wray married Elizabeth Gaines O'Neill in February 1927. She
was born in Nashville in 1909 the daughter of Joseph Thomas O'Neill and
Mary Elizabeth Freese. She was a descendant of Lent Brown a preacher
and Nancy Windrow both of Rutherford County. Henry and Elizabeth Wray
had two sons. Henry Granville Wray was born in January 1928 and John
Thomas Wray was born in September 1929.
In April 1934 he was employed by the Tennessee Valley Authority
in the Maps and Surveys Division. Mr. Wray remained with TVA until
1941 when he moved to California. In 1947 he came back to Nashville
for three years and then returned to California to work with an engin-eering
firm, until he retired in 1968. At that time he moved to Smyrna,
Tennessee to be able to do Genealogical research.
Now in 1975 he has returned to California to be near his children
and grandchildren and enjoy the milder climate. He is expected to con-tribute
some articles for future publications of the Historical Society.
