  <abstract>Modern photograph of an early 19th century house at the site of Buchanan's station in Nashville. The log building in the foreground is a remnant from the small fort and homestead on Mill Creek founded in 1780 by Major John Buchanan, great-grandfather of John Price Buchanan. Buchanan received a land grant in what was then North Carolina, prior to Tennessee's statehood. Buchanan Station was the site of an attack by Indians on Sept. 30, 1792 in which his wife, Sally Ridley Buchanan, played a heroic part. The structures are now gone and the historic site lies under an industrial complex near the intersection of Elm Hill Pike and Massman Drive.</abstract>
