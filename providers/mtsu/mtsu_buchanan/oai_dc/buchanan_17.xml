<dc:description>R ecruiting will begin this
fall for the first class of
University Honors
College Buchanan Fellows.
The Honors College and
Office of Admissions will &#8220; wel-come
applications from every-where
and from everybody,&#8221;
said Dr. Jill Hague, interim
associate dean.
&#8220; We want stu-dents
in all
areas&#8212; all
majors and all
interests.
We&#8217;re seeking
diversity in
every sense.&#8221;
The
Buchanan
Fellows,
named for alumnus and Nobel
Laureate Dr. James M.
Buchanan Jr. ( B. S. &#8217; 40), will con-sist
of a special group of honors
students selected for participa-tion
in a six- course cohort cur-riculum
to be known as the
Buchanan Seminars, said Dr.
Phil Mathis, dean of the Honors
College.
Buchanan, a native of

Murfreesboro, received the Nobel
Prize for Economic Science in 1986
for his development of the contractu-al
and constitutional bases for the
&#8220; public choice&#8221; theory of economic
and political decision- making.
&#8220; The courses&#8212; six hours in the
humanities, eight hours in the natu-ral
sciences and six hours in the
social sciences&#8212; have been devel-oped
for the Fellows to take as a
cohort group during their first two
years in the Honors College at
MTSU,&#8221; Mathis said.
The dean added that each
Buchanan Seminar was individually
designed by its instructor for the
Buchanan Fellows Cohort Group,
with an emphasis on the epistemo-logical,
philosophical and interdisci-plinary
connections among the vari-ous
disciplines.
&#8220; Faculty mem-bers
involved are
award- winning
teachers and schol-ars
who are experi-enced
in honors
education and plan
to provide a unique
learning experience
for these students,&#8221;
Mathis said.
Plans call for 20 fellows to be
chosen annually from a pool of
applicants who show high academic
promise and who meet grade- point
average and American College
Testing criteria for guaranteed
admission, Mathis said. In time, the
number of Buchanan Fellows is
expected to grow to as many as 80.
Hague said chosen recipients
will receive full- tuition scholarships
and $ 1,000 per year for books. The
scholarship will be renewable for up
to four years, provided the student
maintains good academic standing
and acceptable progress toward
graduation with university honors.
&#8220; When tuition increases, the
scholarship ( for Buchanan Fellows)
will, too,&#8221; she said, adding that the
college hopes to offer an incentive for
students to study abroad either for a
semester or a summer.
&#8220; The caliber of students enrolled
in the Honors College is pretty high,
and the caliber of student we&#8217;re turn-ing
out is pretty good,&#8221; Mathis said,
adding that the average ACT for
Honors College students is 29&#8212; the
same as Vanderbilt.
Mathis, who proposed the pro-gram,
also expressed his gratitude to
Dr. Bob Glenn, vice president for stu-dent
affairs; David Hutton, financial
aid director; and Dr. Kaylene Gebert,
executive vice president and provost,
for their roles in convincing MTSU
President Sidney A. McPhee to pro-vide
the resources necessary for the
program.
