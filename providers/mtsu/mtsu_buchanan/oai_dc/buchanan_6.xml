JOHN PRICE BUCHANAN-- FARMER AND POLITICIAN
by Carol Hoffmann

John Price Buchanan is the only man from Rutherford
County ever elected governor of Tennessee. He was one of
those basically unremarkable men who, through a strong sense
of duty and community service, attain high office. Lacking
the charisma of many politicians, most notably his predecessor,
Robert L. Taylor, he nevertheless brought a consistency and
thoughtfulness to his term as governor that is deserving of
more recognition. Although his administration is remembered as
one of strife, if should be remembered that to a large extent
he was a victim of the culmination of long- term problems and
the political factionalism swirling around him.
Buchanan was born in Williamson County, Tennessee. a few
miles northeast of Franklin, on October 24, 1847. His ances&#172;tors
were among the first settlers of the Cumberland; his
great- grandfather was Major John Buchanan, founder of
Buchanan's Station. an early pioneer fort. His father, Thomas,
was a prosperous farmer and slave owner. The young Buchanan
was educated in the common schools of the area and had to gain
additional education by private study. an experience which probably
led to h1s later interest in improving the Tennessee
1
public school system.
Although his father wanted him to go to college, at the
age of 16, Buchanan ran away from home and enlisted as a
private in Reddy's Escort (4th Alabama Cavalry) and was
assigned to Nathan 3edford Forrest's command. serving until
65 '.
his unit surrendered at Pond Spring, Alabama, on May 17.
1865. According to a family story, while retreating from a
Yankee charge, Buchanan rode under a tree and cut his throat
on a hanging branch. For a long time he had people believing
the Yankee did it, but finally told the truth about the cause
of his wound, thus missing out on receiving a pension. 2
After the Civil War, Buchanan moved to Rutherford county
and married Frances (Fannie) McGill, daughter of James and
Amanda (Norman) McGill, on his twentieth birthday, October 24,
1867. In 1873 they moved to a farm on McGill family land
which had been inherited by Mrs. Buchanan. Located on the
Manchester Pike about eight miles southwest of Murfreesboro,
th1s became known as the Big Creek Stock Farm and encompassed,
in 1817, about 160 acres. The Buchanans had eight children
(plus one who died in infancy): James Thomas, John Price, Jr.,
Rebecca Jane, Robert Norman, Margaret Dosia, Susan Matthews,
Prances Louise, and James McGill. 3
Buchanan I B political training and prominence in the
community began early. He first served as! delegate to the
Democratic state convention in 1876 and continued in this
capacity until his gubernatorial nomination in 1890. 4 He
also ran once for County Court Clerk and twice for District
Constable, but was defeated. His start in politics was
described differently by Buchanan himself in an interview with
a reporter for the Nashville Daily American the day after he
was nominated for governor. According to this story he was
a delegate to a convention to nominate candidates for the
66
legislature and his name was propelled. He declined. but his
name was put before the convention a second time and this
time he was nominated. Having never made a speech before. he
told two of his colleague, Mssrs. Avent and Sparks, that he
had a good horse and buggy and would drive them around if they
.... could do the talking. At the start of the trip one of the
other men became 111 and Buchanan began speaking for himself. 6
Actually. he probably began speaking for himself earlier than
that since in 1881 he chaired a meeting of the Rutherford
County Democrats &#8226; to resolve that the 100- 3 debt settlement
(law to fund state debt at full face value by three percent
interest bonds. with interest coupons acceptable as tax
payment) was &#8220;a step toward serfdom. 7
However it began. Buchanan's fairly short success as a
politician cannot be separated from the rise of the farmer
movement in Tennessee and, indeed, in most of the U. S. Many
of the concerns he voiced and the legislation he was involved
With, both as a representative in the General Assembly and as
governor, were influenced by the farmer movement and,
naturally. by his own farm background, and he was to show a
remarkable consistency of thought throughout his six years in
Nashville.
In the years following the Civil War, farmers were
increasingly burdened with declining prices, rising~ costs.
overproduction and foreign competition. In addition. they
felt alienated from the local elites. As a result. several
farmers&#8217; organizations were formed. (The agrarian revolt in
Tennessee was not as profound as in the Deep South because of
a more even industrial development and les8 dependence on
cotton.) The most well-known of these was the Grange (Patrons
of Husbandry) of which there were Dore than 1,000 chapters 1n
Tennessee by the 1870&#8217;s. As the Tennessee Grange declined 1n
membership 1n the early 1880&#8217;s, two organizations, the National
Agricultural Wheel and the ' Farmers' (or Southern) Alliance
moved in to fill the vacuum. These two groups were united In"
December of 1888 as the Farmers' and Laborers Union to
America. 8 In Tennessee, the two groups were organized at
Nashville in July, 1889 under the same name (usually called
the &#8220;Farmers&#8217; Alliance" or simply the &#8220;Alliance") as a tax
: exempt, chartered bus1. nsS8 corporation and acted a8 a farmers'
cooperative. By 1890 the Tennessee .Alliance had between
30,000 and 50,000 members. 9
Hot initially a political organization, the .1lliance'g
main goal was to lessen farmers'' dependence on merchants.
Theoretically, only farmers, farm laborers and country school
teachers, ministers. physicians and mechanics were allowed
to join, but in practice some men of property and status
became members as they enhanced the .Alliance's social standing.
(Buchanan himself was the fourth largest landholder in the
25th District of Rutherford County.). Specifically excluded
was anyone connected by ownership or employment with a mercantile
business, lawyers and any stockholder in a bank. IO
.1 typical Alliance program included the following
points: 1) Just income tax; 2) popular election of officials;
68
.........
3) regulation of interstate commerce; 4) 
patent laws; 5) pure food laws; 6) regulation of transporta&#172;tion
systems (and ultimate government ownership); 7) free
silver coinage) public school industrial education and
improvement of agricultural colleges; 9) restriction of the
liquor trade. II
Naturally, 1n order to articulate these goals the
! Alliance soon became a political force. Starting at the
grass- roots level, by 1888 41 out of 132 Tennessee leg1818&#172;tors
elected in November of that year were Alliancemen. 12
The next step was to recognize that execution of any political
program depended on capturing the machinery of the Democratic
party Which had fallen into the bands of the conservative
&#8220;courthouse rings" after Reconstruction.
Buchanan joined the Agricultural Society in 1883. He
became the first president of the Tennessee Alliance in 1857
and president of the combined Wheel and Alliance in July of
1889. The real power in the Alliance, however, was John H.
McDowell, vice president of the Southern branch of the
Alliance and editor or the Weekly Toller (Nashville), the
movement's principal mouthpiece.
Buchanan first went to Nashville as a state representative
in 1887. As a freshman legislator Buchanan was not especially
active but did display interest in topics that he would
follow consistently during the next six years. They included
Civil War veteIl8n's pensions. the improvement of the public
school system, economical government, the need for a new
69
In the Forty-} l' 1! the General Assembly (1887) he introduced
House Bills To pension certa1n soldiers, which passed with
amendments; authored an amendment to a road bill decreelng
the amount allowed for use of a wagon and team (adopted
March 24); and put forward a pet1tion from the County Court
of Rutherford County relative to redistricting the various
countless into new school districts. Notably, it was left to
N. T. Delaney. of Sullivan County, to introduce House Bill 231.
To charter the Farmers' and Laborers' Association. He was a
member of the standing committees on Finance. Ways and Means.
Pen1tentiary and Tippling and tippling Houses. 13
In the 1889 session of the General Assembly, Buchanan
became more active. Bills introduced included: House Bill
164 (With H. E. Palmer). To carry into effect. Article 4,
Section 1 of the Constitution (referring to qualification of
electors); House Bill 203, To regulate the business of
banking;" House Bill 239, To &amp; mend the law apportioning the
State into congressional districts; and House Bill 543. To
prevent the location of hosp1tale b; r counties and munici&#172;palities
Within the vicinity of charitable institutions
maintained by the state. He was also influential in the
passage of House Bill 233. To exempt agricultural agents from
privilege tax.
Under the heading of &#8220;Explanations" Buchanan followed
his party and voted to support an Appropriation Bill (Senate
70
b
Bill 456). but; objected. to a raise in salaries for two
officials and to spending t4. $4,000 for stationery and voted no
on a joint resolution to adjourn sine die sine die because there is a
quorum present in both Houses and there is important business
to transact which will require an extra session. and this is
both unnecessary and inexpedient when that busines8 can now
be transacted It (with H. E. Palmer and nine others). Committee. 
memberships in the Port; y- Sixth legislature were Finance. Ways
and Means and Charitable Institutions (chairman). l.
The contest tor the gubernatorial nomination was not
one of personalities so much as it was a fight among factions
of the Democratic party which had been in disarray since the
Civil War. Three distinct groups had emerged. the Bourbons- &#172;the
Old South, states&#8217; rights conservatives-.. were the 8trongest
faction though they lost control of the governor's office in
1886. Their leader was Senator Isham G. Harris, secessionist
leader and Civil War governor. The New South group favored
industrialization and, because of their resources, enlightened
leadership and success in bargaining with the Republicans tor
patronage and legislation, they had an influence dispropor&#172;tionate
to their size. their leader was Colonel Arthur S.
Colyar, industrialist, lawyer, and publisher of the Nashville
Daily American. the third group was the small farm element,
or wool- hat boys, who looked for their leadership to Buchanan
and McDowell (and Andrew Jackson, Andrew Johnson and Robert L.
Taylor). l5
71
When McDowell first announced he wanted Buchanan as
Governor the urban press did not take it seriously. and also
questioned the possible conflicts of interest caused by
Buchanan's association with the Farmers&#8217; Alliance, a problem
that would continue to plague him until he retired from active
politics 1n 1892. Democratic papers stressed the importance
or party solidarity.  In a short article copied from the Obion
Democrat at the beginning of 1890. the Nashville Daily American
 wrote.
If J. P. Buchanan really means to run for governor
he should endeavor to escape forthwith from the bands
of some of his alleged friends. It may be added.
without overstepping the bounds of truth or propriety, that the idea of 
J.P. having any symptoms of a statesman borders on the ludicrous. 16
In the campaign leading to the Democratic convention of
1890, Buchanan&#8217;s relative obscurity proved attractive to
farmers and other voters since it distanced him from the
machine politics they were dissatisfied with. By the middle
of May, 1890, 28 county Alliances and hundreds of sub-
alliances endorsed Buchanan and proved to be ready- made
campaign organizations which were able to dominate county
conventions. 17 In Rutherford County he carried three out of
six wards in Murfreesboro and, in general, he was strongest
in Middle and Western Tennessee, winning all the delegates
from the Middle Tennessee counties of Marshall, Warren,
Grundy, Van Buren, White, Stewart and Cannon. 18
The Democratic state convention, which was known as tbe
"Farmers' Convention," began on Jul 15, 1890. Buchanan&#8217;s
72
&#8226;
opponents were Jere Baxter. the New South candidate; Josiah
Patterson, for the Bourbons: and John Taylor.
The Alliance platform was tailored to avoid frightening
delegates with radical proposals. They pointedly excluded
mention of the Sub-Treasury Plan which they had long advocated
and limited themselves to calling for free coinage of silver,
a recognition that agrarian interests are the mainstay of a
dual system of government, condemning the Republicans
legislative discrimination against this class. and to con&#172;demning
the granting of land to corporations instead of home&#172;steaders
( the only true Alliance Plank). 19
More far-reaching was the regular Democratic party
platform. It contained the following points: 1) opposed to
importation of pauper labor and for opening public lands for
homesteading: 2) gold and silver coinage and ready conversion
of paper money to metal; 3) extension of free school system;
4) strict economy and minimum government expenses: 5) Just
and equal taxation: 6) amendment of lien laws for protection
of farmers and mechanics; 7) establishment and development of
good roads; 8) welcome capital and labor to the state; and
9) modification of the penal system to eliminate compet1tion
with free labor. 20
Buchanan's name was put into nomination by committee
Chairman J. D. Richardson and it took 26 ballots before he
was declared the Democratic candidate for governor. His
victory can be seen as being more the result of successfully
capitalizing on the enmity between the Bourbon and New South
groups than because of personal popularity.
7)
Patterson. Senator Harris and John Taylor threw their support
behind him because of fear of a Republican victory (and Negro
domination) in the fall.
Buchanan ' s acceptance speech endorsed the principles of
the Democratic party: &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226; as long as the power of speech
will endure, I will be heard proclaiming to the people the
great principle of Democracy as enunciated by Jackson, Polk
and Johnson." He also declared himself opposed to large
national or state government and for strict adherence to the
constitution. 21
Right after the convention. in an interview with a Daily American
reporter in his room at the Duncan Hotel, 22 Buchanan
expanded on the topic of his loyalty to the Democratic party
and stated that the interest of farmers lay with the party.
I am making this campaign as a Democrat on a
Democratic platform. I have never urged anybody to
support me because I was an alliance man or a farmer;
in fact, I have never told that I was a farmer in any
speech I have made. It is .a grave mistake to suppose,
as some do, that I am seeking to array one class
against another or that I want to benefit the agri&#172;cultural
at the expense of other interests. I believe
that the farmers cannot be benefited by any course
which would be oppressive or unjust to other interests.
None more than the agricultural interest is benefited
By the legitimate growth of the mercantile, manufac-
turing and railroad interests. It is in our interest that the 
merchants with whom we deal be
prosperous, that manufactures should be developed, and
that transportation facilities should be increased and
cheapened. We want nothing that would injure any of
them, but we want to help all and hurt none. I want to
be a Governor for the whole people of the State, and
you know me well enough to know that I will be because I 
have always been a square, clean, upper-case Democrat. 23
He Would return to this theme over and over again in an
attempt to avoid strong identification with the Alliance,
74
part of his reasoning being that many at the Alliance demands
were national in scope and had no place in state politics. There
was much excitement in Murfreesboro when news 
of Buchanan 's victory at the convention was received. It is
said that the Court House bell was rung tor nearly an hour,
and the Murfreesboro Journal went so far as to put out
an extra. 24 When he arrived back in Murfreesboro from
Nashville on July 19 over 2.000 people met him at the depot.
A procession had been organized which included a pleasure
wagon carrying local society ladies and was emblazoned with
the slogans, "Andrew Johnson from the tailor's bench; Buchanan
from the plow," and " It is not wealth, nor pomp, nor state,
but git up and git that makes a man great." The procession
route started at the train station. went east on Main Street
to the Public Square and up to Academy Street, north on
Academy to College Street, west to Lebanon Street and then
back to the Square. 25
the gubernatorial contest began in the newspapers before
any of the candidates (Buchanan; Republican Lewis T. Baxter;
and David Cato Kelley, Prohibitionist) hit the campaign trail.
In the Daily American Buchanan. or "Old Buck" as he was now
being called, was praised as a man with the courage of his
convictions, an able leader of debate in the legislature, and
watchful of his constituents' interests. It was pointed out,
in an effort to reinforce his appeal to the farm element,
that he was a self- made man, did not have much money to spend
on politics and that his farm was not well improved and lay in
an indifferent part of Rutherford County. 26
75
The Republican-controlled Nashville Banner, on the other
hand, dug up Buchanan&#8217;s poor political showing on the local
level ( see page 2) and once again questioned the influence
of the Alliance on Buchanan and the Democratic party Which it
pictured"&#8226;&#8226;&#8226; kneeling down abjectly and taking upon its neck
the yoke of a secret class political organization, whose
pledged policy is in outright antagonism to the time- honored
and fundamental principles of Democracy." also pointed out
was the fact that the Republicans had had to give Up service
to some national policies, such as the Force Bill, that were
odious to the South. 27
Buchanan began his gubernatorial campaign in earnest
early in September, 1890. Speaking to a crowd in Franklin,
Williamson County. his opening speech followed Democratic
policy closely and was a model for future speeches and for
his legislative goals as governor.
He went on record as being  for states' rights and against
alien ownership of land. Centralized wealth  was blamed on
the . Republican tendency toward centralized government and
could be cured by revising the tariffs. breaking the power of
the monopolists, free coinage of silver and creating a greater
money supply. Economy in government was stressed and was used
as one argument against the Force Bill ( Which called for
federal supervision on Congressional elections). Buchanan
called for the extension of school system facilities and an
increase in the school term from tour to nine months. His
enlightened views on penal reform included separating criminal
classes and decreasing competition With honest labor.
establishment of good public roads and the development of
resources were also discussed. Finally, again. Buchanan
stressed that he was wedded to no special interests. 28
Organized out of Democratic headquarters in Room 7 of
the Maxwell House Hotel in Nashville, Buchanan's campaign
schedule was a busy one. especially considering the transportation
facilities of the era. Included in the schedule

As in all political contests. rumors and counter-rumors
were soon flying. To refute a report that the entire Murfrees&#172;boro
bar would vote against Buchanan. the Daily American sent
a reporter to canvas the membership. He found that of the 25
members. 16 were tor Buchanan. seven were against and two
were doubtful. 30
77
In reply to the  Daily American's claim that thousands
took part in a procession in Murfreesboro on November 1, the
Nashville Banner reported only 204 people, tour carriages,
one drag, two bandwagons, four or five buggies and 60 people
on horseback. According to the Banner story this group
marched around for a half hour then went to Mason' s Opera
House where transparencies were shown and Buchanan made the
same speech as elsewhere, on which many people walked out. 31
Election day in 1890 vas on November 4 and the results
Were as follows.
[chart omitted from transcript]
The reasons for his victory were: 1) continuity of
voting habits; 2) organized Alliance support; and 3) the
discriminatory effect of new election laws. As was true at
the state convention, Buchanan's strength was in Middle and
West Tennessee. After his Victory, he went to Florida to
recuperate. 33
Buchanan was sworn in as Governor of Tennessee on
January 19, 1891. His inaugural address ran true to form.
Its main points:
78
1. The system of government has fallen into serious errors;
violated the principles of equality by the undue protection of
a favored class. It has made " dangerous strides toward
plutocracy by submission to the power of aggregated money; it
has centralized power until it threatens the destruction of
popular government and the rights of the States to local self-government.
It has by these errors fostered monopoly until
it has placed itself within the merciless grasp of this
relentless tyrant."
2. Tennessee has. on the whole. a good code of laws. Care
should be taken to enact only needed laws and not overburden
the statute books. Buchanan believes in the Jeffersonian non-interference
theory of government. The weakness of the state
does not come from inefficient laws. so much as inefficient
execution of laws.
3. Government should encourage the development of the
material resources of the state. Progress should not be in
&#8220;booms&#8221; but in growth upon a solid base of an increase in
Wealth and taxable property. resources and revenues bringing
prosperity to everyone. His administration will welcome all
capital and labor that are for the best interests of the
state in the development and proper use of resources.
Capital should be protected by the " strongest security guar&#172;anteed
by law." The extension and further development of the
educational system depends on increased material prosperity;
crime will decrease as literacy increases.
4. Monopolies and sectionalism denounced.
79
In his first message to the legislature, Buchanan
expanded on the topics covered in the inaugural address and
in his previous speeches. the emphasis being on education
and penal reform ( see Appendix 1 for summary) 35
At first Governor Buchanan received praise and support
from both Democratic and Republican newspapers. The Nashville
Banner commended him for presenting a " well- considered and
broad- minded" message to the legislature and, quoting the
Memphis Commercial said, " He has laboriously and intelligently
addressed himself to his executive duties, won respect, and
made friends every day since his inauguration." 36
But trouble wasn't long in coming and Buchanan's admin&#172;istration
proved to be one of the stormiest in many years.
His problems revolved around three issues: 1) the distribu&#172;tion
of patronage; 2) the Coal Miners' Insurrection in East
Tennessee; and 3) his continued affiliation with the Farmers'
Alliance and, especially John H. McDowell.
As governor, Buchanan tried: &#8226; to follow a pragmatic policy
designed to build an independent base for his party. However,
in doing this, he inevitably alienated some of the party
regulars. Especially galling was the appointment of John H.
MoDowell as coal- oil inspector of Nashville, a lucrative job
( $8,000 a year vs. only $4,000 for the governor) that was seen
as payment for his work as Buchanan's campaign manager. It
was predicted that McDowell's radical Alliance views would
reflect badly on the governor. 37
$ a
The major event of Governor Buchanan' s term of office
was the Coal Miners Insurrection which took place in East
Tennessee, a revolt that had its roots in Tennessee's convict
lease system. After the Civil War there was a general
increase in crime in the South which the impoverished states
were ill- equipped to handle. Like many Southern states.
Tennessee began leas1rlg convicts to companies in order to pay
for the penal system, and even make a profit.  During Governor
Buchanan's administration the lease was held by the Tennessee
coal Iron and Railroad Company at $ 100,000 per year. The
convicts were put to work in fOI mines and Bub- leased to
other mining companies in East Tennessee.
38
The convict lease
system had long been criticized both tor the deplorable
conditions under which the convicts were kept and because
cheap convict labor took Jobs from honest laborers.
Conditions were also poor for the honest miners.  They
were paid in scrip. sometimes at irregular intervals, were
forced to trade at the company stores and could not trust
the weighmen employed by the mine companies.
These grievances came to a head in the summer of 1891
when miners at the Tennessee Coal Company mine in Briceville,
Anderson County, were told to sign a new &#8220;iron-clad" contract
which would have left them little better off than slaves.
The miners refused to sign and on July 5 convicts were
brought into Briceville to take their place. Ten days later
the miners took over the convicts' stockade and took the
prisoners, their guards and officers to Coal Creek where they
were put on a train for Knoxville. The same thing happened
on July 20. both at Briceville and at the Knoxville Coal 00.
mine at Coal Oreek. To each uprising Governor Buchanan res&#172;ponded
with state militia -- three companies on Jul,. 16.
then 14 companies, under General Sam T. Oarnes. Governor
Buchanan' e general attitude toward the miners. as he told
them in an address at Thistle Switch, was that be had to
enforce the laws and that they should go to court to redress
their grievances. . By agreeing to call a special session of
the legislature to examine the problem. the governor was able
to avoid bloodshed and he personally. accompanied the convicts
back to the stockades at Briceville and Coal Creek on July 25. 
39
Public opinion. in general, was sympathetic to the
miners and Governor Buchanan was criticized for being a tool
of the industrialists and for overreaching his powers by
calling out the militia. .11 So , the problems of the convict
lease system and the miners' grievances were only postponed,
not really solved.
Governor Buchanan called an extraordinary session of the
legislature on August 31, 1891. Twelve points were enumerated
as purposes of the session:
1. give executive disposal of sufficient forces ( civil or
military) to execute the laws
2. reform penitentiary and convict lease system;

In his message to the session the governor talked at
length on the penitentiary question and the problems at the
mines and recommended: 1) repeal of the lease law; 2) immediate
restriction of convicts to a few mines through changes
in the lease contract; 3) change in the criminal law so
counties could use minor offenders on public roads; and
4) removal of the penitentiary to a location outside the
Nashville city limits. 41
The extra session was not a success, at least from the
miners' point of view. Although a law ' Was passed prohibiting
payment in scrip. it had a limited term. Primarily. the
extra session appropriated more more  money for the militia and 
gave the governor limited authority to use them in limited situations
when the local government could not cope. It did not repeal the lease
law, which shortly afterwards were upheld by the State
Supreme Court ( presided over by Chief Justice Peter Turney)
In the fall of 1891. the miners rebelled again, this
time under the influence of a more radical leadership. On
October 31. convicts were released at the Tennessee Coal
Mine and the stockade and buildings burned. This action was
repeated at Coal Creek and. on November 2, at Oliver Springs.
Governor Buchanan was very slow to act and when he did it
was only to reinforce branch prisons and offer rewards for
the leaders of the miners and tor the escaped convicts. With
the convicts gone. the Coal Creek Valley miners were once
again employed with the iron- clad contract abolished and
their own check- weighman.
The peace was not to last, however. On December 31,
1891, the convicts were returned to the Knoxville Iron Mine
along with the militia, a stockade. trenches and a Gatling
Gun. In August. 1892, the fourth miners' revolt began, this
time in M1ddle Tennessee at the Tennessee Coal Iron and
Railroad Company mines at Tracy C1ty and Inman. Governor
Buchanan an::! the prison board issued a joint statement
declaring the lease contract forfeit, but before it could be
carried out there were new rebellions at Ol1ver Spr1ngs and
Coal Creek. a large militia force suppressed this last
uprising, this time not without bloodshed.
Al though over 300 people were indicted and tried after
this rebellion, most were acquitted or given minor sentences
and the miners were back in the mines by the fall. The
convict lease system was finally abolished in 1896 when the
contract ran out. at which time the convicts went to work
mining coal tor state use only at the new facilities at
Brushy Mountain. 42
Buchanan's political career was badly damaged by the
Coal Miners' Insurrection. He was caught between the business
element who considered the strike a crime and thought
it his duty to enforce the law and labor and reformers
( including the Farmers&#8217; Alliance) who considered the system
unjust. Some blamed him for negotiating with strikers.
others tor calling out the militia. He was made to appear
the victim rather than the master of circumstances. and
perhaps he was.
The Farmers' Alliance faction of the Democratic party
was able to get into office only because of the disarray of
the regular party; they were never fully accepted by party
leaders and as soon as the old- line Democrats saw an opportunity
they began working against Buchanan. The Coal Miners'
Insurrection, of course, gave them just such an opportunity
and they used this and their dissatisfaction with his
patronage policies to add fuel to their campaign. By late
in 1891 Bourbon successors to Buchanan were being mentioned,
including Chief Justice Peter Turney of Franklin County. By
March of l892, 17 Democratic dailies had declared themselves
as
opposed to the governor's re-election, 43 and the Bourbons
had repudiated the leadership of Buchanan and McDowell.
Buchanan's primary problem, however, was still his relationship
with John H. McDowell, ' the Farmers' Alliance and,
by the Spring of 1892, the newly- formed Peoples' Party of
Populists.
McDowell was accused of fraternizing with Negroes and
even with dining with a Negro, Jehazy Cole, which stirred up
the always- present fear of Republican- Negro domination.
Buchanan tried to maintain his position by realligning
his loyalty to the Democrats and distancing himself from
the Populists. He thought a third party of agrarians would
be detrimental to the South and made a public statement of
his views in late March. 1892:
If you wish a declaration of principles from me.
look at the Democratic platform of 1890, upon which
I was nominated, by Which I pledged myself to stand
&#8226; &#8226;&#8226; am still standing, and expect to stand until the
democracy &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; shall formulate another &#8226;.&#8226;
I am opposed to a third party or peoples' party &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;
There is need of an unbroken front in the ranks
of the Democratic party against Republicanism and
third partyism. and I regret to say that the radical
elements in the party are endeavoring to array
faction against faction. The great conservative
masses Will, however, I believe, hold in check these
elements in accord with the spirit of the call issued
by the National Democratic Committee.
But the damage had been done. The Democratic party was
again factionalized as in 1890. but this time it did not
work in Buchanan' s favor. Rutherford and Tipton Counties
86
each sent two delegations to represent them at the gubernatorial
convention of 1892 because neither Buchanan nor
Turney men were strong enough to prevail. Many former
Buchanan supporters joined the Peoples' Party, thus disrupting
the Alliance faction. Some people said they wanted
to vote tor " Buchanan without McDowell," but the governor
would not break with him. 45 The Peoples' Party, on its part,
tried to take strength away from both the Democrats and the
Republicans. To make matters worse. McDowell declared hlmself
a Populist and by June 1 Bourbon control was almost
complete. 46
Realizing his situation vis- a- vis the Democratic party
was hopeless, Buchanan withdrew from the governor's race on
July 3d, 1892. Calling his opponents " sky~ blue bolters" and
" radicals." he made a rather bitter speech in which he announced
he was no longer a candidate for renomination in which he
covered the following subjects:
1. He has tried to keep the party united but it has now
split into hostile factions.
2. He has been true to both the Alliance and the party.
3. An organization like the Alliance should be nonpartisan
but must concern itself with the effects of legislation. The
Democratic party should promote the interests of all and give
attention and consideration to the needs of all classes since
it cla1ms to be a party of the people.
4. His continued connection with the Farmers' Alliance has
bound him by no political pledge.
87
5. He has obeyed the policies and principles that were
enunciated when elected in 1890. "Had a like obedience been
rendered by all those who accepted its declarations. the
party of Tennessee would have continued united and harmonious."
6. The radical faction affected alarm because of the
presence of . Alliancemen and declared "vindictive warfare" on
all who did not agree. They resorted to unfair means to
secure the party machinery and coerce voters at the primaries.
they sacrificed party welfare for factional gain.
7. The August 9 convention will be controlled by the same
elements which are not representative of a majority of voters.
B. He thanked his friends for their generous and faithful
support and released them from any restrictions which might
be imposed by his continued candidacy. 47
Shortly after, Governor ' Buchanan was drafted by a
coalition of .Alliancemen, Populists and " Buchanan Democrats"
and announced as an independent on August 15. The Populists
endorsed his candidacy on . August": 18 The other candidates in
this race were Peter Turney ( Democratic). George W. Winstead
( Republican) and Edward H. East ( Prohibitionist).
As an independent candidate, Governor Buchanan&#8217;s: platform
included free coinage of silver, an increase in the currency,
popular election of U. S. Senators. restriction in agriculture
futures dealing, free trade, abolition of national banks and
prohibition of alien ownership of land. The last two planks
of the platform. went beyond the ideas or the Tennessee
Populists; the whole platform was similar to the Alliance
platform of 1890. 48
In Southern politics in 1892 it was not unusual for the
Republicans and Populists to cooperate against the Democrats.
In Tennessee, for instance. the Republicans offered
to withdraw Winstead in return for Populist support of
President Harrison. Here again, Buchanan became the victim
of his loyalty to J. H. McDowell.
On October 23, a sensational account came ' out ( called
the Ivins- Hill letters) concerning a deal engineered by
McDowell between the Republicans and Populists. According to
this deal, the Republican national committee agreed to pay
McDowell $15.000 for bringing Buchanan into the contest and
for aiding the Republicans in electing legislators and congressmen.
McDowell was to be further rewarded by election
to the U. S. Senate by the Republlcan/ Populist- controlled
legislature. It was charged that McDowell failed to live up
to his part of the bargain. except for the candidacy of
Buchanan and, in addition. threatened to withdraw him from
the race when the $15,000 was slow in coming. 49 This was
the final blow to Buchanan's hopes for a second term;
although he was not implicated he was made to look like a
tool of McDowell.
The Republican/ Populist fusion failed and those who
voted for Buchanan in November represented an alienated
element of the Democratic party, both things combining to
seriously weaken Democratic hold of the state for several
years to come. The total vote in the 1892 gubernatorial
election was Turney, 126,348; Winstead, 100,577; and Buchanan,
29.916. 50 The Populists won only five out of 99 House seats
and one Senate seat. 51
In spite of the large number of Alliancemen and farmers
in the Forty Seventh General Assembly, the legislation produced
was rather lackluster. Important acts of Buchanan s
administration included the declaration of the first Monda,y.
in September as a legal holiday,.. the creation of a Bureau
of Statistics and provision for inspection of mines and
provision of assistance for Peabody. Normal COllege. A Confederate
Pension Bill was enacted, first appropriating $ 60.000
( raised to $100,000 in 1899 and $980,000 in 1923). Perhaps
most important was the act to establish and. maintain a uniform
system of public schools-- the " Secondary,. School Law
( Chapter 132, Acts of 1691). Also during Buchanan's term&#8226;.
interest on $469.000 worth of bonds was reduced from six to
four percent. 52
Buchanan's final act as governor was to send a message
to the legislature on January, 1893. In this message he
discussed at length the labor troubles and the status of the
prison question. revision of the Criminal laws and convict
labor. He reported on state finances and expenditures and
spent considerable time on the public school system, including
statistical evidence of its growth and development over the
preceding teo years. Also reported on were charitable institutions
and the Farmers' Institutes. finally. he called for
90
a new Constitutional Convention, amendment of the election
laws and inspection of state banks. 53
Buchanan probably realized from the beginning that his
governorship might only last one term, depending as it did
on a critical balance of Alliancemen and lack of unity among
old- line Democrats. He followed consistent and fairly progressive
policies throughout his political career and that
his term as governor was less than a success was not entirely
his fault. Like so many high- ranking politicians before and
since he became a victim of situations not of his own making
and of the excesses of a subordinate, in this case, McDowell.
His personal character and integrity were never seriously
questioned.
Buchanan had never moved his family to the :: governor I a
Mansion preferring instead to commute to the city. After
completing his term in office he returned to farming and
stock raising. With the exception of supporting his old
enemy, E. W. Carmack, editor of the Nashville American
in the Prohibitionist campaign of 1908,54 Buchanan was never
again active in politics. He did, however, retain an interest
in politics and was eventually accepted again by the Democratic
party. 55
As before he went into state politics, Buchanan retained
an active position in community and agricultural affairs. He
was a member of the board of the Farmer&#8217;s Voice, a ruling
elder of the Mt. Tabor Cumberland Presbyterian Church and a
member of the Free and Accepted Masons. 56
91
In 1925 or 1926 the Buchanans moved into a house at
216 Fourth Street in Murfreesboro. Fannie Buchanan died on
November 30, 1927. The governor was in 1ll health for the
last six years of his life and practically an invalid for the
last two- and- a- half years. Buchanan died on May 14. 1930 and
was buried, beside his wife, at Evergreen Cemetery. At the
time of his death he still owned the farm, but it was
divided into three sections and the house was torn down in
1953. 57

Appendix 1
Summary of Governor John Price Buchanan&#8217;s first message to the
Forty- Seventh General Assembly of the State of Tennessee,
February 11, 1891. ( See Footnote 35)
1. Federal Relations
There is widespread discontent among agriculturalists, in
common with almost every other state, &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; result of unjust
Federal sectional and class legislation for the last 30 years.
The state legislature is powerless to remove them and also
powerless to do anything about the short money supply.
2. Finances
Congratulated past legislature on the success of the
assessment law and recommended appointment of a State Board of
Equalizers for the purpose of more evenly adjusting taxes
among the various counties.
3. Educational Interests
a. Public Schools - The duty of the state to educate
children is no longer a debatable question. In towns
the municipal tax has enabled public school terms
lengthened to nine months and a course of study to meet
lower classes of a college or university, but in the
country the term is limited to four months on the average
and to elementary grades. Recommends extension of the
public school system, establishment of schools in which
higher branches can be taught. uniform textbooks and a
book on civil government.
b. Remuneration for the State Superintendent of Public
Instruction should be placed on a permanent basis.
c. $ 2,000 appropriation for teachers' institutes.
d. Praise for the University of Tennessee.
e. Agricultural College - Must assent to additional
appropriations by Congress to land- grant colleges under
the Morrill Act of 1890&#8226;. Request for further appropriation
for Teachers' Department and &#8226; scholarships.
f. Peabody Normal College - Looking for money from
Peabody Board of Trustees.
4. Charitable Institutions
Need a reformatory for youthful criminals, an industrial
school for girls and other charities.
93
a. Confederate Soldiers Home is most imperative.
b. Private Charities - Thanks and gratitude of the State.
5. Agricultural Department
There have been attempts to abolish the Department from
the belief that it has no practical benefits; this is due to
insufficient funds.
a. The Commissioner of Agriculture should hold institutes
for the purpose of " awakening activity of thought &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;
bringing about an interchange of opinions and experience
upon practical problems, and creating a professional spirit
and pride among farmers. 
b. Increase the appropriation from $8, OOO to $lO, OOO.
6. Geological Reports
a. Interest in investment in mineral resources in
' Tennessee warrants publishing geological reports ( last
appeared 1n 1869).
b. Especially important if State builds an exhibition at
the World's Fair in 1892.
7. World's Fair
Recommended an appropriation for an exhibition commensurate
with the necessities involved and the ability of the
State.
8. Dairy Interests
Should receive encouragement and such protection by law
as will prevent adulteration of products.
9. State Board of Health
a. Board of Health has asked for legislation to help it
register births and deaths.
b. Recommended legislation concerning health of livestock.
c. Recommended sanitary organization by counties to
prevent spread of contagious diseases among animals.
County Roads
Can't see how a uniform law can be reached; left it in the
bands of the Road Congress to help the legislature formulate a
good law.
94
11. Penitentiary
Repeated arguments tor new penitentiary.
a. Convict labor is the best solution to the problem of
expenses.
b. It is injurious to criminals and unjust to taxpayers
to keep convicts in idleness.
c. No practical plan as yet.
13. Corporations and Trusts
a. Talked about the growth of trusts.
b. Recommended " such restrictions. as amendments to
corporation law, as to prevent the issuing of charters
to any other than public. quasi- public, and such industrial purposes
as lie beyond the field of individual endeavor
c. Recommended further restrictions to prevent forming
of trusts.
14. Inspection of State Banks
15.
The present election laws are a success. Remedying any
defects will not leave any excuse for Federal intervention.
16. Military Affairs
The efficiency of the State Guard should be increased and
the duties of the Adjutant- General be restructured so he can
devote proper time to the military.
17. Improvement to the Capitol
Provision should be made for maintenance and repair.
18. Appropriations
Should be adequate to preserve credit, sustain what has
already been undertaken and answer other needs.
Conclusion - It is not the number of laws enacted but their
character and quality that will determine their usefulness.

Buchanan, James. Interview taped by Jeff Whorley ( grandson)
and Dr. James Buchanan ( son), 1970 ( transcribed December 14,
1981).
This is Jeff Whorley. With me are my uncle,
Dr. James Buchanan of Virginia Tech and my
grandfather, James Buchanan, of Rutherford County. We shall
talk about my great-grandfather, James Price Buchanan, who was governor
from of Tennessee from 1891 to 1893 and the only Governor
from Rutherford County.
Thank you, Jeff. That's fine. I think we
can have a nice conversation. Actually, I
don't recall too much about my grandfather. I was about 13
years old when he died. It was about 1933 as I remember. I
remember mostly an old man with white whiskers who used to
bump me up and down on his lap and sing something  about
" chicken foot neck and a gizzard" and a few things like that;
a man, however, Whom everybody respected a great deal even in
his old age. I also remember as a boy about your size I used
to wander around upstairs in the old big house which unfortunately
is no longer here and find all of this literature
about his political campaigns, all about the Farmers' Alliance
and the Wall Street robber barons and so forth during the
Populist period which he was the representative of in the State
of Tennessee. I think they actually elected something like
six governors in 1890 which was a rather strange phenomenon.
The Farmers' Alliance party rather than the regular Democrats.
Jeff, "What I suggest is that you ask Papa what he remembers
about the governor.
Papa, what do you remember about when your father
was governor?;: l Tell us about it.
James Buchanan Well, I was almost too small to know much
about when he was governor, but something
happened that made an impression on me about that time. You
know the state hadn't been working prisoners in the mine up
there up till about the time he was governor and they sent
some state prisoners up there and the miners resented it and
they undertook to run them off. They had to call the state
militia and there was some bloodshed along about that time at
Brushy Mountain, Inman. H. R. Bradley. my uncle by marriage. was
Superintendent of the mines then and had to ____________
brought that all up, you know, about calling the state militia
out to fight the people who lived there, who made a living by
mining. ' that' s about all I remember now.
What about after he was governor? What about
you taking him to the train at Rucker?
James Buchanan I went about every other day to Rucker for
so many years. while he stayed in politics.
And I was just a little shaver and l'd ride behind him to
Rucker and get him on the train and I&#8217;d put on a show coming
back. He'd tell me be sure not to ride them horses fast and
l'd stand up in the saddle and put a regular show on. People
would come out and say yonder come that little ole Buchanan
boy. He's going to get killed. Lord have mercy. he's going
to get killed.
Then you went back and got him at night.
And I'd go and get him in the evening. you
know. and I had to ride about five miles in
the dark. Scared. oh, and I had to go by a church and a
graveyard and you talk about going, I was moving on. I passed
that graveyard and I heard somebody holler. Away I went and
he hollered at me again a little louder and a little louder.
Finally. he caught up with me. He&#8217;d got a train that stopped
about halfway between Rucker and Christiana. He made them
back up and put him off and he got a man and a buggy and
horse and caught me over there. Like to scared me to death.
But I made it home and I'm here now.
Was the governor in the Civil War?
Yes, he was in there the last year. run away
from home and joined the last year of the
war. They went to Alabama. They fought one year in the war.
He was only 16 years old at the time.
Wasn't there something about running under
a bush and cutting his throat?
Yes. The Yankees was charging and they
were running. They had them cut off from
the main beginning and he run under a tree with a great bamboo
stringing down and caught him under the chin and cut his
throat from one side to the other, and he went in first and
told them he got cut by Yankees and had them believing it for
a long time. If he hadn't finally told up he could have been
drawing a pension.
What about the Farmers' Alliance party?
Was it an offset of the Democrat party?
James Buchanan That Farmers' Alliance. now let me see.
There wasn' t nothing on earth but sort of a
farmers' union and they never could get organized again. That
was the beginning of the farmers  union.
Dr. Buchanan After his term the Democratic party sort of
took him back in again, didn't they?
97
.. After he got beat? Yes.
What sort of politics did the governor stay
in after his term in office?
Did be ever run for anything else? He
liked to hang around Nashville.
He was always a politlcian. Stayed in
politics as long as he lived.
Was the governor a good farmer?
James Buchanan Yes, he must have been pretty good to raise
eight children on the farm. Must have been
a pretty fair farm.
