    <title>[Letter] 1797 Jan.17, Knoxville, [Tennessee, to] each of our members in Congress / John Sevier, Governor of the state of Tennessee</title>
  </titleInfo>
  <abstract>This document is a letter written by Tennessee Governor John Sevier (1796-1801) to the members of Congress, dated January 17, 1797. Sevier reported that it was believed that Cherokees had been plundering the wagons of frontier settlers along the Cumberland road and taking their horses, and he stated that the Cherokee agent had complained about the size of the territory awarded to frontier settlers. Also reported, was that at least one Indian had been killed, but Sevier had doubts about this because the subject had not been brought before him by the Cherokees or their agent. After he made complaints about inefficiencies within the postal system, Sevier explained that Captains Wades and Sparks had arrived in the frontier but that their companies were insufficient. Sevier requested that three companies of infantry and a troop of horses be sent to help protect the frontier.</abstract>
