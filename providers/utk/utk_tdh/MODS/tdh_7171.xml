  </titleInfo>
  <abstract>This document is an article of agreement made between William Blount, Governor of territories south of the Ohio River and superintendent of Indian Affairs for the southern district, and David Moore of Knoxville, Tenn. Dated October 12, 1794, the article was written in reference to a large flat bottomed boat, travelling down the Tennessee River, that was carrying goods belonging to the Chickasaw and Choctaw. Moore agreed to take charge of the boat and administer its journey down the Tennessee River to the mouth of Bear Creek, as so directed by Chickasaw chief Opoia Mingo. Moore would also be responsible for protecting the boat against attacks by the Creek and Cherokee, as well as protecting Opoia Mingo and his tribe. Furthermore, the article outlined how Moore and his crew would be paid for their services.</abstract>
