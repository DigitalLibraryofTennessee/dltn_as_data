  <abstract>Gary Ownby, a third-grade teacher at Pi Beta Phi Elementary School, said that at any given moment, children would burst into tears. "We didn't do hard stuff we did stuff just to get back to a regular routine." He treated the children with kid gloves to find normalcy. Cara Parker, a clinical social worker at the Helen Ross McNabb Center said those kids had lost their homes. By January, shelters had closed and people lived in motels. When she visited she encountered stress. As time went on, more families came in for services because the trauma caused by evacuation. The good news? The stigma of getting help evaporated.</abstract>
