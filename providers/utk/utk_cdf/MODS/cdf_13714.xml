  <abstract>This report is a summary of the New Welfare Legislation {P.L. 104-193, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996}, which was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Bill Clinton on Aug. 22, 1996. This new law slashed help for children and families in a broad range of safety net programs. Cuts in federal funds for these programs totaled $54 billion over six years. The New Federal Welfare Law limited welfare to a maximum of five years, restricted food stamp distribution, cut assistance to as many as 300,000 children with disabilities, made it possible to track parents who owed child support payments, and outlined what health benefits children and families could receive.</abstract>
