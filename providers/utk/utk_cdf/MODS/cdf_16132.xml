  <abstract>This report presents the findings from a 50-state survey of state child care administrators, conducted by CDF by phone interview during Dec. 1997 to Jan. of 1998. The data collected from these interviews were verified with each administrator after they were collected. The findings of the report indicate that many families face a series of locked doors. Many are not even eligible for help due to low state eligibility cutoffs for child care assistance. Many who are eligible for assistance cannot get it due to waiting lists or are turned away due to inadequate funds. Enormous gaps still remain in our efforts to help low income families work and take care of their children.</abstract>
