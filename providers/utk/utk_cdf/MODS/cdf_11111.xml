  <abstract>This report is based upon survey forms collected from more than 5,000 families and individuals by some 180 local community agencies participating in the CDF Community Monitoring Project (CMP) in 65 cities located in 16 states between January 1999 and December of 1999. The project was designed to take a closer look at families that had left welfare since 1996 and sought help from these agencies. Most of the agencies that participated in the study provide homeless shelter, emergency food, and other services targeted to the poorest of the poor, making the study a unique look at families who are struggling the hardest in these communities.</abstract>
