  <abstract>This report is one in a series of studies by the Children's Defense Fund examining state policies and practices in child care and early childhood education. It focuses on state expenditures on programs that help low-income families purchase child care, provide preschool education services to children, or provide child care assistance to special groups of families (such as teen parents, migrant or refugee families, or families whose children are at risk of abuse or neglect). Only those programs where the state had discretion over the funding and policies were included--consequently these data truly reflect the level of state commitment to meeting the needs of families and children for child care assistance.</abstract>
