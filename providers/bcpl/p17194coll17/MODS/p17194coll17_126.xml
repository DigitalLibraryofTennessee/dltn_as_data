This depot was erected in 1898, replacing the first depot which had been built in 1891 but later burned. The building in these photographs were replaced by yet another building which was built in 1914. That 1914 building was in service for decades. It has been restored and is currently on the National Register of Historic Places.</abstract><name><namePart>Edwin Best</namePart><role><roleTerm authority="marcrelator" valueURI="http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators/cre">Creator</roleTerm></role></name><originInfo><dateCreated>1905, 1907</dateCreated></originInfo><subject><topic>Greenback (Tenn.)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Louisville and Nashville Railroad Company</topic></subject><subject><topic>Railroad stations</topic></subject><recordInfo><recordContentSource>Blount County Public Library</recordContentSource></recordInfo><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/">In Copyright</accessCondition></mods>
