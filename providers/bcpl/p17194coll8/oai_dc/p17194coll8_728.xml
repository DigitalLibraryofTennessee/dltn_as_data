<dc:description>This building, originally built as a store called Thompson's Stand in 1876, became the first Greenback Post Office in 1883.  In approximately 1891 the post office functions were moved to a new location in present-day Greenback.  The area this building is in became known as Old Greenback.  It is approximately one mile east of the (1979) Greenback Post Office on Morganton Rd.  </dc:description>
