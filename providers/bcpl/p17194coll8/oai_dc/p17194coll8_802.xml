<dc:description>Wagon with produce heading for market. Four horses hitched up to a four-wheeled wagon. Two men are in in the seat, one holding the reins. The wagon is packed full. Visible are wooden crates, a box and bags. Several people are standing near the building. The two in the doorway each are holding a toddler. Another man is near the building while another is on a horse behind the team of wagon horses. A boy with a cap is near the building behind the wagon. The building siding is board and batten. The windows have shutters.</dc:description>
