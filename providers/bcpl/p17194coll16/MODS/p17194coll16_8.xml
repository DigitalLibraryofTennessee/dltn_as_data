He served on two cruises in the Western Pacific, one 9-month deployment beginning in September 1965, a second beginning in November 1966. He was discharged in April 1967. This chapter is based on his written answers to the set of interview questions posed to other veterans. This is the audio of a presentation he made to the Tennessee Vietnam War Roundtable meeting on Oct. 12, 2020.
