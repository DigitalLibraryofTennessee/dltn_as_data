<dc:description>Seventy-eighth birthday, July 11, 1911.  Amanda McTeer (Mrs. Joseph McTeer); Margaret McDermott (Mrs. Gus McDermott); Miss Isabella ('Bella') McNutt White.  (Whose birthday is not known).  
Submitted ID: 
Amanda Morgan White McTeer - born 4 Sep 1844
Margaret Park White McDermott - born 1 Apr 1841 
Isabella McNutt White - born 30 Jul 1833
 
In 1911, they were the three surviving children of George McNutt White and Sophia Moody Park.  If it's one of them whose 78th birthday it was, it would have to be Isabella, though they would've been celebrating a couple weeks early.
