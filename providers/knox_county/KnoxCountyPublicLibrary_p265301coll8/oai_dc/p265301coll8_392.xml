<dc:description>NATION RIDICULES
FAMOUS DIVINE
Says Anti-Suffrage Logic of Dr.
Lyman Abbott is Neat and Bewitching
Dr. Lyman Abbott, in his recently published "Reminiscences,"
expresses deep affection for his
wife, but says: "She loyally supported my views, even when she
did not share them, and we were
of one mind."
The Nation of Jan. 27 comments on this point as follows:
"How natural is Dr. Abbott's opposition to woman's suffrage!
Put into words, the argument lying implicitly beneath this statement would run somewhat as follows : The well-regulated man
and wife are of one mind, even
when they do not think alike, and
that mind is the husband's.
Therefore, it is sure of perfect
expression if the husband does
the voting. One may accept or
reject the conclusion, but the logical nea(missing) (missing)f the argument is
bewitch(missing) (missing)ny rate."
