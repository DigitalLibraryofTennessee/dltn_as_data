<dc:description>be expected to cast their votes as
strictly partisan as will their husbands. Many of them interviewed on
the streets and in the stores smilingly
admit that they do not know anything
at all about it. They are able to glibly
recite the names of the candidates
which will appear on their county
ticket, but cannot tell, in many cases,
what offices they seek nor who their
opponents are. Yet, in seven out of
ten cases, they say: "Sure. I'm going
to vote. I think it's my duty. Don't
you?"
And the reporter agrees with them
and starts seeking another interview,
vainly hoping that he will find at least
one women who knows what she is
talking about and why.</dc:description>
