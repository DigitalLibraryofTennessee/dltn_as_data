<dc:description>Equal Suffrage association and Knoxville Equal Suffrage league.
Being 21 years old, we object to being
classed with  minors.
Born in America, and loyal to her
institutions, we protest against being
made perpetual aliens.
Costing the treasuries of our counties
nothing, we protest against acknowledging the male pauper as our political superior.
Being obedient to the law. we protest
against the statute which classes us
with the convict, and makes the pardoned criminal our political superior.
Being sane, we object to being classed
with  the  lunatic.
Possessed of an average amount of
intelligence, we protest against legal
classification  with the  idiot.
We taxpayers claim the right to representation.   
We married women want to own our
own  clothes.
We married breadwinners want to own
our own earnings.    We mothers want an equal partnership
 in our children.
We educated women want the power
 to offset the illiterate vote of our state.
 Women who object to being thus
classed, and men who object to thus
classing mothers, sisters, wives and
daughters, are urged to join the Knoxville Equal Suffrage league and help to
obtain a higher classification.</dc:description>
