<dc:description>NEARLY 18,000
ARE REGISTERED
Half as Many Women as Men
Reported, Books Close at
9 O'Clock Tonight
Despite the fact that today is the last
day of the biennial registration, the
books closing tonight at 9 o'clock, only
about 100 more women and 126 more
men had registered up until noon today
than had registered when the books
were closed last night at 9 o'clock, according to reports from each of the precincts. Up until noon today reports
show: Men registered, 11,663; women
registered, 5,898; total, 17,561.
In order to vote in the municipal elections or the constitutional convention
election, citizens must have registration
certificates of the present general registration.
It has been suggested that the rain
of this morning was partly responsible
for the light registration for the half day
and that the afternoon would see from
600  to  800  additional  registrations.
