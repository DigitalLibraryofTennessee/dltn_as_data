<dc:description>Tennessee Awake.
Even Tennessee legislators have been
aroused and our old,  barbarous laws ate
at last about  to  be  cancelled.
We mav hope that soon the wife will
be allowed to manage her own property.
That the widow will inherit the sums
as the widower, that the mother will be
made an equal guardian with the father
of their children;that women will be
recognized as an influence in our school
system, so they may give their best help
to remove the blot of illiteracy that so
mars our reputation as a progressive
common wealth.
It  certainly will not   be   long   before
the men   of  Tennessee   will   realize   that
in  depriving the daughters of our  state
of  their  right   to participate  in   the  affairs of government  which    they       are
taxed to support, they are robbing them
of rights guaranteed by   the constitution
of the United  States.
The   dead   have   been   awakened&#8212;shall
I sleep ?
The  world's  at war     with     tyrants&#8212;
shall I crouch?
The harvest's ripe&#8212;and shall I pause to
reap?
I  slumber not&#8212;the  thorn  is    in    my
  couch.
Each day a  trumpet soundeth   in    my
ear.
It's echo's  in  my  heart.
&#8212;BYRON.
&#8212; L. CROZIER FRENCH.</dc:description>
