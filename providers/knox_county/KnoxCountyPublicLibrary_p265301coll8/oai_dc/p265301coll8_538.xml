<dc:description>Calendar For Christmas
The Collegiate Equal Suffrage League
of New York has published a calendar,
giving a suffrage quotation for everyday of the year. The colors of the
cover are blues and greys. Between
the Ionic columns are the stars of the 
four suffrage states. The calendar, it 
is hoped, will serve as excellent pro- 
paganda, for a mass of testimony is
put together, the quotations ranging
from Plato to Judge Lindsey. Many
of us will be surprised to find how
great a number of distinguished men
and women have already declared in
favor of woman suffrage. The calendar offers an answer, too; to the
frequent question as to the literature
of the subject, for a complete bibli-
ography could be made from the list
of authors. The price is $1.50, postpaid. Orders shoud be sent either to
Alice Duer Miller, 62 East 53rd St.,
N. Y. City, or to Harriet Burton Laid-
law, 312 West 90th St., N. Y. City.     
A few sample quotations:
 "You possess the intelligence to
know how much of that happiness
which you are entitled to hope for,
both for yourselves and your children,
depends upon the right administration
of government and the proper tone of
public morals. That is a subject on
which the moral perceptions of women
are both quicker and juster than those
of men.'-&#8212;From Address to the Ladies
of  Richmond:    Daniel  Webster.
"One   sex   bears   arms;   the   other
bears soldiers."
"Not only is he idle who does nothing, but he is idle who might be better employed."&#8212;Socrates.
"Woman suffrage is undoubtedly
coming, and I for one expect a great
deal of good to result from it."&#8212;Henry
W. Longfellow.
"Everything in the movement to
give women the suffrage appeals to
my reverence and sense of justice.
There is no other help for men but in
their civic betterment."&#8212;William
Dean Howells.
"I am not accustomed to use the
language of eulogy. I have never
studied the art of paying compliments
to women, but I must say that if all
that has been said by orators and
poets since the creation of the world
in praise of women were applied to the
women of America, it would not do
them justice for their conduct during
the war."&#8212;Abraham Lincoln.</dc:description>
