<dc:description>WHY WE GO ON
     Now  that  the  ballot for women is
so nearly won, why should not the 
 National American Woman Suffrage 
Asociation prepare to disband? This
question is sometimes asked. It was 
well and clearly answered by the Na- 
tional corresponding secretary, Mrs. 
Shuler, in a recent address before the 
Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Asso- 
ciation; she said, in part: 
"It   is   asked   why   we   should      not
give  up  our  organization,    instead    of   
changing it  into a League   of Women
Voters. -        
"In  the  first  place,  our work  is  not
done.     We   have   not   yet   secured   the 
ratification   of   the   Federal       Suffrage 
amendment   by   the   necessary   36   leg- 
islatures
"In  the second place,  the machinery   
of our organization  has enabled us to
keep   together   a   band   of  women   who 
are  courageous,  and  willing  to  undertake legislative  work.    We should take
hold   of   the   constructive     work     now
needing  to  be   done.     When   the     gov-
ernment   had   big   work  to   do     during 
the war, it called upon  the suffragists,
and  they made a  colossal record.
"Another reason why we should not 
disband our national organization is 
that so many of the questions in which 
women are interested are national questions, and therefore cannot be  turned
over wholly to the state legislatures.       
"Again,   there must  always  be  some
grea t  force   which   agitates  and     educates, if the country is to advance: we 
ought to be it. 
"Finally, we ought to maintain our 
organization because, while we have in 
our suffrage work some women of
great breadth of vision, yet the rank 
and file of women&#8212;and of men, too, 
for that matter&#8212;are uneducated in political affairs, and we must educate 
both the women and the men."
