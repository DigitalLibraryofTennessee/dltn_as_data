*******'*********
Complete and   final figures
received by
The Journal and Tribune from
all of the 31  registration precincts in the city
 after the general registration was brought to a 
close   last   night   show   that   the
number
of certificates issued during the ten
 days' registration  was  19.,02.
Certificates  were issued  to
12, 471 men,
while   the  number   of   women
totaled   6,831.     About   200   absentees were registered.
By   these  figures   it   is   shown
that   ap-
proximately a    third    of the
registrants are  women.     One   of  the  features of the registration
 was   the   interest manifested
by  the  women  in   almost   every ward
of the city.
 Last night the  registration officials found it difficult to handle the large number of
 of men  and women who appeared at
the   registration   precincts   shortly before the closing hour/
 Rgistration Totals.
