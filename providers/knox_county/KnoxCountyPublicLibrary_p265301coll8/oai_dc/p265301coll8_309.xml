<dc:description>Crozier-French Delegation.
Mrs. Stanley McCormick, of Chicago,
chairman of the credentials committee,
announced Wednesday night that the Crozier-French delegation from the Tennessee association would be seated in
the convention over the McCormick delegation. This decision and the holding
of the caucus completed the preliminary
work of  the  association.
The first regular session of the convention will be held tomorrow, when
the delegates will be welcomed to the
State and city by Governor Ben W.
Hooper and Mayor Hilary E. Howse.
Response will be made by Mrs. Crozier-
French, president of the state organization, and Mrs. Guilford Dudley, on behalf of the Nashville Equal Suffrage
league. The morning session will be
devoted to routine business. The report
of the credentials committee is the chief
business of interest scheduled for Thursday. The Illinois contest is yet to be
threshed out and it is likely that the
Tennessee contest will be carried on the
floor of the convention.
More than a thousand delegaes (sic.)  and
visitors have already arrived and the
rest   will   come   Thursday   morning.
The up-town district of the city is
gay with countless yellow streamers
bearing the words "Votes for Women."
Miss Jane Addams, of Chicago, was
among the leaders of note arriving this
morning. She has accepted an invitation
to speak at Vanderbilt university tomorrow.
The session of the convention Thursday night is officially designated as
"cotton evening'' and all members, it
is   announced,   will   wear   cotton   frocks.</dc:description>
