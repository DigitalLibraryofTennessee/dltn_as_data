<dc:description>Women's Industrial Conference   
Meets In Washington January 18
All national women's organizations and
all national organization having a large proportion of women members are
being asked to send delegates to the Women's Industrial Conference In washington January 18 to 21.  Employers and business organizations have also been invited. 
The call to the conference was issued today by the Women's Bureau
of the U. S. Department of Labor,
accompanied by a letter of endorsement, and approval from the secretary of labor,  who says:
"There are eight and a half million employed women and their number is increasing rather than decreasing. It seems to me that this situation creates special problems,
which call for careful consideration
of means by which to safeguard the mothers and potential mothers of the nation.  In the last decade the increase of married Women in manufacturing and mechanical industries was 41 per cent. In the occupations connected with trade there has been an increase of 43 per cent for all women employed but an increase of 88 per cent among married women. Therefore, it is im- possible to separate entirely the problems of motherhood from the conditions under which women are Iemployed. There is nothing more important in our civilization and every thinking American must realize this situation. It is with great pleasure, therefore, that I approve of your plans for calling a 3-day conference.  Miss Mary Anderson, director of the Women's Bureau. which is holding the conference, says in her call which  goes  out today:  "The,   Women's    Bureau    believes  that a conference of women, including representatives from all, national organizationsof women and other interested groups would go  far not
 only to focus attention on the problems involved, but to help in the development of policies and standards for the
effective  employment of women in industry. Our indus-
trial success will depend largely
upon the practices in industry which 
make for the health and happiness 
of women workers. It is with this
in mind we are calling the confer-,
ence and urge the fullest partici-
pation by the women of the country."
The conference will be held in the
New National Museum, beginning 
the morning of January 18, and con-
tinuing for three days.
