<dc:description>In speaking of Mrs. L. C. French,
who is now in Chattanooga, the Chattanooga News says:
"Mrs. Lizzie Crozier French is a frequent and welcome visitor in this city.
She  is  known  throughout    Tennessee
and the south as a woman who is pro-
gressive in the truest sense' of that term,
whose mind, heart and soul reflect only
that which is good and reject all that
is   evil.    Educated  to   a high   degree,
possessing rare refinement,   she unites
personal magnetism and love of humanity to such an extent that she is equally
approachable to the lowest and the high
est.    The proudest women in Tennesse
claim her as their personal friend. She
 is the founder of Ossoli Circle, Knoxville, the first federated club    in    the
south.
