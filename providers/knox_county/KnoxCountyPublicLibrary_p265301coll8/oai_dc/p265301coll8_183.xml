<dc:description>OSSOLI MOVES
AGAINST SMOKE
Mrs.  L C. French Writes
To Women Of Knoxville.
Constitutional   League    Extends Invitation To Housewives To Join Crusade.
Ossoli Circle has inaugurated a
movement to abate the smoke nuisance in Knoxville and Mrs. E. Crozier French, members of Ossoli Circle, and chairman of the Constitutional league has addressed the following open letter to the citizens of
Knoxville, men and women, asking
their co-operation in bringing this
matter to a successful conclusion:
"For many years the housewives
of Knoxville have uttered complaints
loud and long about the soot and
smoke that has been permitted to
invade their homes, destroying
ruthlessly their clothes and household furnishings, multiplying many
times the labor of housecleaning
and the cost of the laundry bill.
"Many have said to me "Please
start a movement to abate soot and
smoke and we will help"
'Women of Knoxville, how many
of vou will make good an join in the
crusade just started by Ossoli Circle
to work for a purer atmosphere that
will conduce to greater cleanliness,
and better health?
"The   civic   committee     of    Ossoli
went   before     the     commission     on
Tuesday  morning  and asked for an
ordnance that would require factories and engines to    consume    their
own  smoke.  The reply of the  commission  was  that   if     some    device
could be found that would abate this
nuisance   without   working   a   great
hardship  on  factory    owners,    they
would consent to act in the matter.
"I   herebv   extend     an     invitation 
from  the   Constitutional   league     to
Knoxville citizens, women and men,
to  meet with   this  society     at     the 
Woman's building Wednesday afternoon at 3 o'clock to hear a proposition made by one who has success- 
fully put in operation soot and smoke
destroyers.
"General discussion of the ways
and means of bringing about the
purifying of our atmosphere will be
called for, and it is believed that
much will be accomplished if the
people will get behind this movement
and push with all their might. How
many will help?
(Signed)
"L. Crozier French,
"Chairman,   Constitutional   League."
