<dc:description>"Another  privilege  of the  citizen  of
the  United  States   is  to  demand  care
and  protection   of   the  federal  government over his life, liberty and property
on the high seas or within the jurisdic-
tion  of another  government.  Right to
use navigable waters    of    the    United
 States, however they may penetrate the
territory of the states, all rights secured
to our citizens by treaties with foreign
nations are dependent upon citizenship
of the United States and not citizenship
of  a   state.     A   citizen   of  the  United
 States can, of his own volition, become
 a citizen of any state of the union by
bona fide  residence  therein,  with    the
same rights as other citizens    of    the
state."</dc:description>
