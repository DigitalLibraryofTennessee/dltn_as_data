*MRS. L. C. FRENCH       
 GIVES   "SUFFRAGIST" AS HER "AVOCATION." 

Votes for women?   Certainly. 
Suffragists ?     Certainly 
 again, and also yes, indeed! 
 Knoxville can boast   of   at 
 least one woman who admits 
that  she  is   a suffragist  and  admits it in such a way that 
there can be no doubt of her  pride in the fact. This woman 
is    Mrs.    L.    Crozier French, 
 who has taken such a promi- 
nent part in women's  activities  in  getting  the ballot  in 
 this state and indeed    in the 
nation wide fight for suffrage.
Mrs.    French    even    claims 
herself a suffragist   by   pro- 
fession and her friends  have 
known for some time that she 
 was a suffragist at   least   by 
avocation as her work in this 
 cause has been   characterized 
 by untiring enthusiasm    and 
sound faith in    the   ultimate 
 outcome. 
When     registering,    which 
 Mrs. French made, one of her 
early morning duties on this 
 very  significant    registration 
day   for   Tennessee's   women 
 voters,    she    was  asked  her 
avocation.    Some of the wo- 
men who  had  registered be- 
fore Mrs. French,    and    some 
who   have     registered   since 
have hesitated at that ques- 
tion.   Not so with this pioneer 
leader in the women's   rights 
movement.   She took an add- 
ed grip on her    pen,    smiled 
 with a   determined    curve to 
her lips,  and    wrote    "SUF- 
FRAGIST."
