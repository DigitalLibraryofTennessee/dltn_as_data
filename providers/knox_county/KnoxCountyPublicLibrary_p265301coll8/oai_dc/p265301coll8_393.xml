EQUAL SUFFRAGE CLUB


G. Armistead Collier,    Jr.,    of Memphis, Was Heard      
Saturday.
W. Armisstead Collier, Jr., of Memphis, a close student of social and philosophical problems for a number of

economic justice. Mr. Collier, in
speaking of the reformation period,
referred to Fourier and St. Simon,
