<dc:description>PETITION HOOPER TO
NAME WOMAN JUDGE
-
Mrs. L. Crozier French, well known
among   Memphis   club   women,   social workers and equal suffrage advocates
has become  a candidate for judge  of
the juvenile court at Knoxville.    She is
the first woman in the state to publicly aspire to such an office.
A number of Memphis women have
written letters supporting her Candida
cy. Mrs. French has many close
friends here. She was a prominent
figure in the convention of the Ten-
nessee Mothers' congress in Memphis
last year, and this year the congress
has indorsed (sic.) a bill enabling women to
become members of school boards and
juvenile court judges.
"No policemen nor lawyers are allowed in a juvenile court of the right
character." declares a pitition (sic.) to Gov.
Hooper which has found many Mem-
phis signers, and seeking the appoint-
ment of Mrs.  French  to     the    place.
 "Visitors should  be admitted   only by
tickets issued by the judge.    The whole
idea is to remove the children as far
as possible   from     the    suspicion     of
crime,  and  to  keep as secret as possible   the delinquencies of children, to
the  end that reformation may be accomplished    without    the    hardening
processes that might ordinarily follow
the ordinary trials in other courts.
"It was happened that this idea has
not  obtained, with some  of the    men
 who have been placed at the head of
juvenile courts in several of our cities
and that in consequence no great im-
provement has been made in regard to
the condition of children over the old mode  of trial.    No one who has    not
served an apprenticeship to social service is fitted for the place of juvenile judge."&#8212;Memphis   News   Scimitar.
