<dc:description>CITIZENSHIP CLASS
WORK COMPLIMENTED
Mrs. L. C. French, in her official
capacity as chairman of the good
citizenship class which is conducted
every Thursday afternon at 3
o'clock at the Lawson McGhee li-
brary has just received a letter
from the head, of the Welfare de
partment of one of the large coal
companies commenting upon te
work of the class. The letter is as
follows: "I notice from the papers that
you are still conducting the classes
in Good Citizenship, and I wanted
to write and tell you how very important I think this is. Recent
events have shown this. The election of superintendent of city schools 
for example. I do not believe you 
could make a better contribution to
the times, or serve in a better way
that to help develop the naturally
public spirited side of women. My
experience of five years as social
service worker has shown me this
In fact it seems to me the men need
some such help as much as we do
I hope much from the advent of
women into public affairs, and your
classes will, I feel sure further this (rest is missing)
