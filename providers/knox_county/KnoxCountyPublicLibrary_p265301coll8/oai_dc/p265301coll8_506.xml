<dc:description>WILSON PLEA FOR SUFFRAGE.
Democratic Party Pledged, He Telegraphs Tennessee Senate.
An earnest hope that the Tennessee
senate will reconsider its recent action
in rejecting a woman suffrage bill was
expressed by President Wilson in a
telegram yesterday to the president of
the senate. The measure already had
passed the lower house of the legislature, and the president said he felt the
upper house was shirking a moral responsibility when it refused to accept
it.    The telegram follows:
"Hon. W. R. Crabtree, president of
the Tennessee senate: May I not express
my earnest hope that the senate of
Tennessee will reconsider the vote by
which it rejected the legislation extending the suffrage to women? Our 
party is so distinctly pledged to its 
passage that it seems to me the moral 
obligation is  complete.
"WOODROW WILSON."      </dc:description>
