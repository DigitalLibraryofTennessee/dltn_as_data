Mrs. L. Crozier French Guest Of
Browning Circle.
Tuesday was the annual observation of Vice-president's
day of the Browning Circle. At
the close of the business meeting, Pres. Mrs. Moody presented Mrs. W. W. Grant to the Cir-
cle as the Vice-president. Mrs.
Grant made a fine talk and at
its close, introduced Mrs. L.
Crozier French, of  Knoxville,
who was present as the honored guest of the Circle. Mrs.
French made a very interesting and instructive talk on,
"Law, its necessity, beauty and
beneficence." In speaking of the
laws of Tennessee as relating
to women, she spoke of the
fact that they had been wonder-
fully improved by the last legislature and would be made
still better by the next one.
Mrs. French is Pres. of the Suffrage League of Tennessee and
of course wants to see and says
she will see, the women of Tennessee given the ballot. She is
a very entertaining speaker and
a very pleasant appearing lady
and makes friends wherever
she goes. The ladies, fortunate
enough to be present at this 
meeting were loud in praises 
of the afternoon's entertainment.  The rooms of the libra- 
ry were artistically decorated
in yellow and white the club colors.
 A social hour was enjoyed during which tea and sand-
wiches were served by several
young ladies thus- closing a very pleasant afternoon.
TUESDAY NIGHT
Mrs. French spoke to the cit-
izens of Athens    in the library
Building Tuesday night at 7:30. I
Her subject was ''The Enfran-
chisement    of    Women."    Her 
talk was logical, instructive and 
 entertaining. She presented her
 ideas in a plain matter of fact 
way that appealed to her audi- 
ence.    After the meeting steps
were taken toward the organization of a Suffrage League in 
Athens.</dc:description>
