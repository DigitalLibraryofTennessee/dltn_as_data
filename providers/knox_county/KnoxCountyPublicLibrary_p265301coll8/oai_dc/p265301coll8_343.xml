<dc:description>Suffrage in Indiana.
Indiana women have won suffrage. The
bill giving them the right to vote for presidential electors, for almost all state officers and in municipal elections passed
the Indiana house by a vote of 67 to 24
and the senate by a vote of 32 to 16. Gov-
ernor Goodrich has said that he will sign
it. The measure will go into effect when
the governor proclaims the enforcement of
the statutes passed by the present legislature, probably in-April. Women will vote
for the first time at the election to select
delegates to the constitutional convention
in September. 
With Indiana on the list of free states&#8212; I
and   counting   presidential   suffrage  estab-
lished in Ohio&#8212;women  will vote in fifteen 
states  and   one   territory.     They   will   cast 
their   votes   for   135   presidential   electors, 
influencing the selection of more than one- 
fourth of the whole electoral college.    They
will   have  weight  in   the  choice   of  ne(missing)
one-fourth   of  the  house  and   one-th(missing)
the Senate. &#8226;</dc:description>
