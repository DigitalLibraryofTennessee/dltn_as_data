<dc:description>VICTORY   FOR   SUFFRAGE.
Special to The Knoxville Sentinel
WASHINGTON,      April    4.  &#8212; Having
obtained   a   majority   vote   in   the   senate
in   favor   of  the   amendment   for   woman
suffrage,  the  congressional committee   of
the national association feel that a great
victory was achieved recently when
the vote was taken. Although there wa
some controversy as to whether the vote
should   have  been postponed,    it  is  prob-
able that a postponement would have
lost instead of gained votes. The thirty
five who voted for the amendment are Ashurst, Arizona;  Brady, of Idaho; Bris-
tow, Kansas; Burton, Ohio; Chamber-
lain, Oregon; Clapt,. Minnesota; Clark, 
Wyoming; Galliinger, New Hampshire;
Gronna, North Dakota; Hollis, New
Hampshire;   Hughes,   New   Jersey;   Jones,</dc:description>
