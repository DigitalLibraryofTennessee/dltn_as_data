<dc:description>Good Blood
Means good health, and Hood's
Sarsaparilla has an unapproached
record as a blood-purifier.
It effects its wonderful cures, not
simply because it contains sarsaparilla
but because it combines the utmost
remedial values of more than 20 different
ingredients. There is no real substitute
for it. If urged to buy any preparation
said to be "just as good" you may be
sure it is inferior, costs less to make,
and yields the dealer a larger profit.
Get Hood's Sarsaparilla today.   In usual liquid form or in chocloated tablets known as Sarsatabs.
