<dc:description>GENERAL KNOX
LOOKS THEM OVER
AND WRITES A FEW
OPEN LETTERS
TO MRS. L. C. FRENCH,
President Ossoli Circle&#8212;
DEAR MRS. FRENCH: Your calling of a mass meeting
for Sunday afternoon to hear a lecture on "Selected Motion
Pictures" and to have an open forum on that subject, is a
splendid act of good citizenship.
The picture play is here to stay and I am glad of it. But
I think that most picture plays are not suitable mental food
for boys and girls and some of them are not fit for grown-ups
to see.
Censorship is not the remedy. The motion picture, like the
drama, the play, and the newspaper, is an interpretation of
life, and a criticism of government and institutions. As such a
form of art, the motion picture must be free, or we will never
find out the truth about life, nor solve the problems of society
But that does not mean that we must meekly stand for the
salacious stuff the movie producers often give us in the name
of "art." We can put such movies out of business simply by
refusing to see them and by not allowing our children to see
them. Best of all, we can let the manager of the theater know
in no uncertain terms that he cannot have our patronage if he
does not cut out that sort of movie.
The boycott of the indecent movie is not all that is required.
Some pictures, while good for grown-ups, are not suitable for
the young.    Special matinees should be given with films suitable for children
If the churches, women's clubs and parent-teacher associations would guarantee to movie managers a certain audience
of children on Saturdays, they would be glad to show special
films for children and young people at that time, I am sure,
and one movie a week is enough for the child.
General Knox.</dc:description>
