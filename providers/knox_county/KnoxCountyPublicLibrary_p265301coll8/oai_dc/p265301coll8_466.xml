<dc:description>Contract   in   Louisiana. 
 A   strong   article   on   this   subject   
recently came  out  in Hampton's Magazine
 entitled,    "What    Eight   Million   Women
Want."      Colorado   is   called    "Woman's
Paradise,"   and   Louisiana,   is   contrasted
 with it.    "In Louisiana," says the article,
"your   disabilities   actually   begin   when
 you become an engaged girl. [From that]
happy   moment   on,   you   are   under   the
dominance    of    a    man.      Your   wedding 
presents   are   not   yours,   but   his.     Your
clothing, your dowry becomes community
property  as  soon  as  the  marriage   cere-
mony   is   over   and   community   property
 in   Louisiana   is   controlled  absolutely  by 
lthe husband.    During the husband's life-
time  he   is   sole  guardian   of  their   chil-
dren.     At   his   death   she   may   become 
their guardian,  but if she marries again
and   the   law   permits   her   to   remarry
provided  she  waits  ten  months,   she  re-____________ her   children   only  by   formal   con-
sent   of   her   first   husband's   family.     
If they   dislike   her   or   disapprove   of   the
second  marriage,   they   may   demand   the
custody   of   the   children.     In   only   ten
states    are    women      co-guardians    with
their  husbands   of  their children."
 Conditions   In   Colorado.
     Miss Jane Addams has declared  (after
close study of the subject)   that   the laws
in Colorado are superior
in reegards
to women and children than of any
other state. Women in Colorado receive
equal pay for equal work, they are 
guardians of the children and the edu-
cation of the children is placed almost
entirely in their hands. </dc:description>
