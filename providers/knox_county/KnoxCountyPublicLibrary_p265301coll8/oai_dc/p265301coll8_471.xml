<dc:description>Difference of Opinion in Securing Suffrage.   Mrs. Funk and Mrs. Seton Express Opposite  Views at
Mass Meeting.
LOCAL WOMEN'S WELCOME
Suffrage    Leaders    Present
Reasons    Why    Women
Should be Given Vote.
Lateness  of  the  hour prevented  an
interesting  discussion    between    Mrs.
Antoinette    Funk,    of   Chicago,    vice-
chairman of the congressional committee of the national woman's    suffrage
association,   and  Mrs.    Seton,  of  Connecticut,   vice-president   of   the   Connecticut  state league  and also  chairman of the national program commit-
tee,  at the conclusion of Mrs. Funk's 
address before the opening session of
the convention of the Tennessee Equal
Suffrage association Wednesday night.
Whether public    opinion    has    weight
with  legislators,   was  the  question  at
issue.
Mrs. Funk explained a resolution
which had been prepared to put before
congress which would provide for an
amendment to the United States constitution, giving women a sweeping
privilege to vote. All this could be
accomplished, she maintained, at one
stroke, with not more preliminary
work than it would take to get the
states lined up by means of public
opinion in favor of suffrage. Understanding Mrs. Seton's difference of
view on this particular phase of proposed legislation to enfranchise women, Mrs. Funk invited that lady to
express her opinion on the subject.
Mrs.  Seton  arose  and    stated    that
she differed with Mrs. Funk and while
differing she  represented a faction in 
favor  of  moulding   public   opinion   in 
favor of passing the old Susan B. An- 
thony resolution which would give the
women a vote.    Her principal point of
difference,  she stated,    was that    she
saw   insurmountable   obstacles  in   the 
way of inducing the national legislators to pass such a resolution as Mrs. 
Funk    had    detailed,    without getting
the support and moral maintenance of
the legislators' constituents.
Mrs. Funk asked Mrs. Seton to outline in detail her objections to the
plan that has been agreed on by the
national congressional committee, but
Mrs. Seton declined to speak further
owing to the lateness of the hour and
her unpreparedness. "I feel that I
could debate the question, however,"
said she. "But I hardly think this the
proper time to begin what might take
hours,"
It was then past 10 o'clock.
Market hall was comfortably filled
with an audience comprised mainly of 
women at the opening session of the 
convention of the Tennessee Equal
Suffrage association Wednesday night.
About thirty-five delegates were in attendance.
The principal address of the evening
was delivered by Mrs. Antoinette Funk
of Chicago, vice-chairman of the national congressional committee of the
National American Woman's Suffrage
association.
Mrs. L. Crozier French, president
of the Tennessee association, presided.
She outlined briefly the history of the
woman suffrage movement in the
United States, and defined the factions, or parties, of suffrage as they
stand today. She also gave a history
of woman suffrage in Tennessee, summing up the results of work begun in
1909. The Knoxville Equal Suffrage
league  she  stated,   was   organized   in
1910, when there was only one other
league in the state. Since that time
leagues have been organized in other
principal cities of the state.
Addresses of Welcome.
Miss Ada Fanz, vice-president of the
Knoxville Equal Suffrage league, delivered a brief address in which she
welcomed the delegates and visitors in
the name of the Knoxville Equal Suffrage league. Mrs. R. L. Cunningham,
president of the Women's council, of
Knoxville, welcomed the convention on
behalf of the Knoxville women's clubs.
In an address Mrs. Geo. W. Denney,
president of the state federation oi
women's clubs, welcomed the delegates
and the convention on behalf of her
organization.
Mrs. George Baxter, state regent, of
Tennessee chapters, Daughters of the
American Revolution, also extended a
welcome and greeting. </dc:description>
