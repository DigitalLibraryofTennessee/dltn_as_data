<dc:description>Ramifications of System Will
Extend Down to "Block
Chairmen" With  Assistants
The discussion of further plans
for   the   organization   of   the   six
districts of the city for the coming election of councilmen  under
the   city   manager   form   of   government, took place at the meeting   of   the   League   of   Women
Vters this afternoon at the Woman's     building.     Mrs.     W.     L.
Morris,   president,   presided   and
the   program   was   in   charge   of
Mrs. J. Marion  Miller.
At a previous meeting of the league
the president appointed six chairmen
to perfect an organization of the women  in   their   districts.   Each  chairman was to appoint a vice-chairman
to assist in the district organization.
In   making   the     appointments,     the
president   was   careful   to   alternate
with  republicans  and  democrats,   so
that  there  would   not  be   any  party
feeling  to  possibly   mar  the  organization.
Appointments made thus far are:
First   district&#8212;Mrs.    R.    L.    Cunningham,   democrat,   chairman.      No
vice-chairman has yet been announced.
Second district&#8212;Miss Kate White,
democrat, chairman. No vice-chairman has yet been announced.</dc:description>
