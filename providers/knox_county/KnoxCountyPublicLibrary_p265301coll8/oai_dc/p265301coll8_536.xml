<dc:description>RECOGNITION OF WOMEN IN THE
APPROACHING CITY ELECTION IS
OBJECTIVE OF VOTERS' LEAGUE

The qualifications that candidates
for councilmen under the city manager form of government should have,
and recommendations for candidates,
'"will be the principal discussion at
the next meeting of the League of
Women Voters, Thursday, June 21.
This was decided at a meeting held
yesterday afternoon at the woman's
building, after it was suggested that
the league get down to specific work.
A committee was also appointed to
prepare a questionnaire which will
be sent to all candidates when they
are announced. This committee, will
meet Saturday morning and will be
composed of the chairmen and vice-
chairmen of each district, the offi-
cers of the league and the following
ladies also: Mrs. H. M. Wilson, Mrs.
T. A. Wright, Mrs. Lucy Reed, Mrs.
Lonas.
This committee will work out a
program whereby the league can use
its influence immediately with the
nominating committee in the selection of the candidates for councilmen.
It was suggested that the questionnaire to be sent out should seek to
find out if the candidates are trained
for the position they will hold, if
they are in favor of law enforcement,
and if they are connected with any
corporation having financial deal-
ings with the city.
Want Women  Named
It was intimated at the meeting
that the league would insist that
women be named as candidates as
well as men, and that a fight will be
made to have women on the school 
board.
"If we do not ask for a woman, or 
women, we have no right to exist 
as a league of women voters," said ,
Mrs. W. L. Morris, president of the 
league.
An advisory council of six men to 
consult with the league at any time
a consultation may be necessary, was
voted upon after the names had been
presented by a committee previously
appointed for the purpose of selecting an advisory council. They were: J.
. Jones, T. A. Wright and J. Donaldson, republicans; Weston Fulton,
Fred Ault and John Ayres, democrats.
This committee also selected Mrs.
Fred A. Ault as head of the department of public health in the League
of Women Voters; Mrs. E. L. Thomas,
head of children's department; and
Mrs. L. C. French, head of the wom- 
en's department. The duties of these
women will be to work for any laws 
concerning their department. A 
leader for the civics department will 
be chosen later.
First district&#8212;Mrs. R. L. Cunningham, chairman; Mrs. Will Gilbert,
vice-chairman.
Second district&#8212;Miss Kate White,
chairman; Mrs. J. L. Watson, vice-
chairman.
