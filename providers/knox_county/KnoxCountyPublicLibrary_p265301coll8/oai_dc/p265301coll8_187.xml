<dc:description>ASK PASSAGE OF ORDINANCE TO ABATE IT                                                                                                                                       All Women of City Invited To Go To Women's
Building Wednesday.
The   city   commission   Tuesday
promised a committee from Ossoli
Circle  to   "consider"  the  passage
of an ordinance to eliminate the
smoke nuisance.
Mrs. L. Crozier French, chairman of the Ossoli committee,
urged the passage of the ordinance
and submitted to the commission
a copy of the Louisville smoke
prevention ordinance.
Commissioner Adams said he
would be willing to vote for such
an ordinance if convinced it would
really prove effective. He suggested that the commission communicate with other cities to learn
the methods adopted to prevent
smoke and whether or not successful.
Mayor Neal said this would be
done. He said he was not familiar with the use of smoke consumers.
Commissioner Wayland said
much of the smoke came from
railroad engines.
"I doubt if we could compel
them to put on smoke consumers," said Mayor Neal.
Mrs. French invited all women
of the city to attend a meeting of
the Constitutional League at the
Woman's-bldg Wednesday at 3 p.
m., to discuss smoke prevention.
