<dc:description>WOMAN'S PLACE IS WHERE SHE'S NEEDED.
The favorite war cry  of  the anti-suffragists
is "woman's place is in the home."  The real truth is that woman's place is wherever she is needed.  There was a time when she was needed no where else but in the home (and she stayed there).  
   Does she now do so now altho   without the suffrage?  If her place is at home, why doesn't she stay there? (the antis included).
 Possibly     because     she      no
longer is obliged  to mold  candles,  make
soap,   spin  and  weave cloth   as   she   did
in  thai   golden age of  stay-at-home.</dc:description>
