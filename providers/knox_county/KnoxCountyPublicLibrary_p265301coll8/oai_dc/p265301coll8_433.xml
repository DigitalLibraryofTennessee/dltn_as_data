<dc:description>BETTER FILMS
SPEAKER COMING
To Address Mass Meeting At
Bijou Feb. 5.
Movement     Sponsored     In
Knoxville By Members Of
Ossoli Circle.

A mass meeting will be held in the
interest of Better Films at the Bijou
theatre   Sunday  afternoon   February
5th,  at 3 o'clock  under  the auspices
of Ossoli circle.
Mrs. Phillip Spud [Speed], of the University of Virginia, a speaker of national
reputation, will be the chief speaker
at this meeting. She is to be sent
here by the national committee for
Better Films, and is considered an
able, speaker, courteous and cultured.
a club woman with much experience
in motion picture betterment, both
as a mother and a worker. She
heartily agrees with the position taken by the General Federation of
Women's clubs concerning the best
way of promoting improvement of
the movies.
Selection&#8212;not censorship is the solution, they claim. The National
Board discussed this subject thor-
oughly with motion picture theatre
owners of America, and has their assurance that they desire to co-operate whole-heartedly with community
groups which will support finer pictures, family programs and entertainments for young people. 
The desire for selected pictures,
for cooperation with community exhibitors, and for larger assumption
of responsibility by parents has
grown rapidly in all parts of the
United States. The National Board
of Review has led in this movement
for a wise and permanent solution
for the entire country.
The management of the Bijou
theatre has offered the use of the
theatre free of charge for this meeting, and Mr. Frank Nelson has consented to take charge of the musical
feature  of the program.</dc:description>
