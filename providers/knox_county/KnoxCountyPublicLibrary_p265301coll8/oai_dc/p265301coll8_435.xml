<dc:description>A CORRECTION

In the Herald of Jan. 10th appears an article headed "A
 Wrong Idea of Justice." In this
article my sister, Miss Lucy
Graham Crozier is taken to task
for having voted '"no" on a motion disapproving the return of
Arbuckle films to the motion
picture theatres.  There is no
doubt the article does Miss Crozier injustice as she does not belong to the Better Films committee and has had no opportunity of expressing by vote her
opinion on the momentous question as to whether Fatty shall
return or not.
About a month ago the fol-
lowing paragraph appeared in
the Herald:
"A movement was started
yesterday in Knoxville to have
 Governor Taylor appoint Mrs.
 L. Crozier French to succeed
J Senator Shields. Mrs. French
has contributed several articles
to the Herald on political and
educational matters which
makes this appointment of local
interest."
Mrs. Lizzie Crozier-French
has never contributed an article
to the Herald, but Miss Lucy
Graham Crozier has done so. It
is evident that the writer of the
quoted paragraph and the article on "Justice" has confused
two sisters and placed to the
discredit of Miss Crozier the
"wrong idea of justice" of Mrs French. So easy is it to do an
act of injustice because human
nature is prone to error; said
Portia to the Jew, "consider
this&#8212;that in the course of justice, none of us should see salvation."
Another act of injustice in
this connection; Mrs. French
did not vote to have Arbuckle
films return to the screen nor
did she make any plea for justice or mercy to be shown to the
man and she stated this most
clearly at the meeting. She was
simply opposed to the Knoxville
Films Committee taking any
action.
If one of the duties of the
Better Films Committee is to
act on the moral conduct of actors and actresses, I shall certainly resign my membership.
Mrs. Lizzie Crozier-French
Knoxville, Tenn.</dc:description>
