<dc:description>The Really Vital Question.
It  is not a question of "will, we get
it?" but of "what will we do with it
when we do get it?'" So, unless something should happen to turn back the
wheels of national evolution, we had
better begin to study the great science
of statescraft, so as to be able to make
intelligent use of the privileges of the
ballot. And incidentally, some ingenuous woman might turn her attention
towards devising a suitable costume in
which the sex could appear at "these dreadful
 polls" more modestly than some of 
them appear at church or on
the streets  during the present prevailing modes.
