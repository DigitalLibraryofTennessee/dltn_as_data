<dc:description>GREATER KNOXVILLE     REGISTRATION
TOTALS 17,348 - BOOKS CL0SE TODAY
14,000 May Vote In Primaries

7,553 Persons Have Paid Polls
in Greater Knoxville.
Registration  Will  Show   Approximately 5,000 Women.
1,285 Service Men Have Been
Released&#8212;Others Past 50.
Some Are Just 21.

A total of 7,443 persons, residing in
the twenty-six wards of Greater Knoxville have paid their 1918 poll tax, according to the figures just compiled by
officials at the courthouse. This is said
to be about the largest number who
have paid poll taxes in any one year.
It was also reported at the courthouse
Wednesday that a total of 1,285 returned soldiers had secured releases from
poll taxes, under the resolution enacted
by the quarterly county court at the
January session this year. It is expected that many more of these soldiers
will secure releases before the day of
election.
Taking the large number who have
paid poll taxes, those who have secured
releases, those who are over 50 years of
age and not subject to poll taxes; those
who have just become twenty-one years
of age, and not subject for this year's
poll tax; and the large number of women
who intend to participate in the coming
political contests, the indications are
that the coming primary city election
will certainly be the largest ever held
in the history of Knoxville or Knox
county.
It is expected that there will be 5,000
women participate in the coming election and if this be true, and with those
who have paid poll taxes; secured releases; too old for poll taxes and who
have just arrived at their majority, the
total vote in the primary election will, in
all probabilities, reach the 14,000 mark,
which will even be larger than any
county  election  here.
In the payment of poll taxes, the eleventh ward leads with a total of 860,
while the smallest number in any one
ward is the fourth, with only ninety-two.
The number of poll taxes paid in the various wards is as follows:-   First   295    Second   206    Third  149   Fourth   91  Fifth   256   Sixth   254   Seventh   517   Eighth   222   Ninth   615   Tenth   536   Eleventh   860   Twelfth   169   Thirteenth   100 Fourteenth   496   Fifteenth   389   Sixteenth   196   Seventeenth   367   Eighteenth  140   Nineteenth   316   Twentieth   256   Twenty-first   814(?)    Twenty-second     193   Twenty-third  95   Twenty-fourth  106   Twenty-fifth  186   Twenty-sixth  331  Total  7553
service,  together with a living salary,
is my remedy for the trouble.
Favors 2-Platoon.
"Another thing I want to say right
here is that I am strongly in favor of
the 2-platoon system for firemen. It is
out of the question for a city to take
men and say to them; 'Here, you have
to stay in these fire halls 24 hours every
day.' 'They are asking for a 12-hour day
&#8212;other men are asking for an eight-
hour day.
Women's Vote.
"If you will allow me one more digres-
sion from my general subject I will tell
you about seeing the women in Johnson
City while I was in the city teaching at the East Tennessee State normal
summer school. Ove 700 women regis-
tered and voted. There are only two
wards in Johnson City and in one of
them 35 votes were cast out because they were folded or marked wrong How
many of them do you suppose 'mere man'
had cast? Just thirty-three!"
Mr. Patton concluded his address by
urging Knoxville people to correct troub-
les in their schools and to establish systems which will make it possible for
needs of the children of the city to be
met bv the schools.                                                                                                                                                                  Figures Show 11,599 Men and
5,749 Women.  Grand Total Tonight Will Likely
Exceed 18,000.
Heavy   Qualifying-  Among  Recently Enfranchised Voters
Is Surprising Feature.

Complete figures received from all of 
the 31 precincts in Greater Knoxville by
The Journal and Tribune after the close
of the registration books last night show
that 11,599 men have obtained registration certificates while the number of
women registrants totals 5,749, bringing
the total number of registrants up to 17,-
348.
These figures were obtained over the
telephone direct from the registrars in
charge  of the  precincts.
On the basis of these figures it is safe
to predict that the total number of registrants at the close of the biennial registration tongiht(sic.) at 9 o'clock will be well
over 18,000,
