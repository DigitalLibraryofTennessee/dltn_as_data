by the General Federation of Women's Clubs to campaign for better motion pictures," said Mrs.

the important fact that pictures;
must be made better before the
camera films them&#8212;not afterwards, with a censor's scissors.

"Mrs. Speed is opposed to censorship. She dwells on moving
pictures from the point of view of
the mother. She is a mother herself .
"During the war, Mrs. Speed
selected pictures for soldiers in
the army camps.
"We want every parent to attend the meeting Sunday. Our
interests in the movies is constructive not  destructive."
Prof. Frank Nelson will give a
