SUFFRAGE DEPARTMENT

Editors:&#8212;Mrs. Julia Lucky,  President of Equal Suffrage League, and
Mrs. Sara H. Hood.
Suffragists throughout the country
are rejoicing over the fact that the
Tennessee Legislature has at last
passed a woman's property rights bill.
This is a step in the right direction.
The next step, it is hoped will be the
long stride that shall carry the state
to the forefront of Progress&#8212;namely
the passage of the suffrage amendment.
Apropos of the position taken by
Mrs. Arnstein in her article entitled
"The Price of Virtue"&#8212;it will doubt-
less be remembered that the concensus of opinion expressed during
the  recent convention  of   the  Illinois
Vice Commission in Washington City,
was, that the question of wages, except in certain classes of untrained,
incompetent workers, plays a small
part in the down fall of girls. Stan-
ley W. Finch, special agent of the department of justice; Dr. W. C. Wood-
ward, health officer, of the District of
Columbia; Mr. Robert Barrett, son of
the general supervisor of the Florence
Crittenton Homes; Mrs. Adolph Kahn,
president of the Jewish Women's Al- 
liance, and others testified that in a large
 majority of the cases investigated the girls were hounded to their
ruin by vicious men, either to gratify 
their own passions or to swell the coffers of those most depraved of all
criminals&#8212;the White Slavers. "The
social evil," said one speaker, "will
continue to flourish like the Green
Bay Tree, regardless of the wage question.
as long as false ideas  of    manhood and the double standard of mor-
ality  prevails."     On   the  other    hand
facts   were adduced  to  show that  ignorance,
 vanity,   extravagance,  and  a
lack   of  moral     fiber  are     the     chief
uses that render so many girls of all
classes and conditions, easy victims of 
designing, unscrupulous men. Among
the various remedies advocated for
social reform at this convention, none
were more practical than those suggested by Mrs. Harvey Wiley, namely
Sex hygiene instruction for the young
 women police, and the full enfran- 
chizement  of  women   everywhere.
_ 
The movement for Suffrage in Ten- 
nessee as a state-wide movement, is as
yet young. We must never forget, 
however, that in Tennessee for many,
many years, there have been devoted
 spirits who through ridicule, and dis- 
couragement, have kept the lamp of 
woman's advancement trimmed and 
burning until now a younger genera- 
tion  has been awakened to light their
torches at this patient flame, and to
move forward, throwing this light
into dark corners where before no
light of betterment for women has
ever shone. We want the men of Tennessee to realize what it is the women
of Tennessee have done for the State,
from the days of the first settlers in
the wilderness, down through the horrors of war, of reconstruction, of
poverty, of the struggle for rehabilitation,  to  this hour;     to realize the
strength, the wisdom, the patience, the
great, undying love of their women,
and, realizing all this, to give her in
the ballot,, not only the power to help
herself and her children, but, as comrade and friend, to help the men of
Tennessee..&#8212;Sarah Barnwell Elliot.
Pres. Tenn. Equal Suffrage League.      I
AMENDMENT TO THE
FEDERAL CONSTITUTION
THE  RIGHT OF    CITIZENS    OF
THE UNITED.    STATES    TO     VOTE,
SHALL   NOT   BE   DENIED     OR     A-
BRIDGED       BY       THE       UNITED
STATES,     OR     BY        ANY     STATE
THEREOF,  ON ACCOUNT OF SEX."
This is the wording of the proposed
amendment to  the  Federal   Constitution,
   agreed   upon   by   the   committee
appointed to frame it.    Suffragists of
the North,  East, South and West are
united in the feeling that various pro-
pitious     circumstances     render     this
occasion&#8212;the opening of the new con-
gress&#8212;the chance of a life time to secure  the  long    coveted     amendment
President Wilson, therefore, has been
bombarded with resolutions and    letters urging him to  embody the   
recommendation in his message.    Senator
Thomas of Colorado, Chairman of the
Senate Committee on Woman Suffrage
announces   that   the   amendment   will
certainly   be   introduced   and   actively
pushed.    Moreover, it is reported that
a company of 531 women&#8212;one from
each congressional  district and two at
large from each State&#8212;will march to
the Capitol on  Monday    morning    to
present to each Senator    and    Representative
 a petition from home, asking
their support for the measure.    Surely
the well laid plans cannot fail.</dc:description>
