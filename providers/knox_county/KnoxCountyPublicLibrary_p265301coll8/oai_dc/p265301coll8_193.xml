<dc:description>Mrs. L Crozier French Stands
For Protection Of City's Weak
Mrs.   L.   Crozier French,  woman's 
candidate for council at large, is in
for every progressive movement that
will tend to make Knoxville a desirable place to live and a greater business center, she declared yesterday
in announcing her platform. She
also declared that she is for adequate protection for women and children, support for the weak and unfortunate and a city government
that achieves its purpose without
waste or extravagance.
Another plea Mrs. French makes
for support is that she has no other
thing to occupy her and can devote
full time to the city's service.
Mrs. French has been active in
public life of Knoxville for many
years, having been the founder of
Ossoli Circle and other civic clubs
designed for the city's betterment.
Her experience also extends into
educational and uplift fields, where
she has worked untiringly.
Mrs.  French says  she  is    in    the race in response to urgent  requests
from her friends that she is to take 
up the women's cause in the election
and carry  it through.
