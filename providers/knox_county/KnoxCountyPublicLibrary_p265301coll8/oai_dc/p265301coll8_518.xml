No Women Mentioned
So far no women have been mentioned as probable candidates for either
mayor or commisioner, although it is
believed that some may enter the race
in the event the law is construed, after careful investigation, to grant them
the  privilege of holding office.
While Mayor McMillan and Commissioner Crumbiss and Hill are regarded as possible candidates for mayor and
the latter two as possible candidates
for commissioner in the event they do 
not seek the mayorship, the other two 
members of the commission, John W. 
Flenniken. of the street department, and
N. T. Little, of the department of pub- 
lic safety, have stated definitely that
they will not be candidates at the ap-
proaching election.
In the opinion of Knoxville politicians the number of entries in the nonpartisan primary will be as high as 40
or 50.
Two candidates for mayor and eight
for commissioner will be nominated in
the primary Sept. 6 and the voters will 
choose between these at the regular elec- 
tion Sept. 20.
