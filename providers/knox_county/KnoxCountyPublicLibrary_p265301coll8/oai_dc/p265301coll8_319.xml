<dc:description>Ex-Gov. Patterson Asked For
Suffrage Views By Mrs. French.
Mrs. L. Crozier French, president of
the Knoxville Equal Suffrage league
and one of the pioneer workers for
suffrage in the state of Tennessee,
never lets pass an opportunity to work
for the cause. Since first embracing
the movement Mrs. French has done
much active work and the Equal Suffrage league, under her direction, is
planning an active campaign for the
coming year.
The following telegram has been
sent to Gov. M. R. Patterson at Nash
ville, and local members are awaiting
with  interest  his  answer:
"Gov.    M.    R.     Patterson,     Nashville,
Tenn.
"We are surprised that you failed
to declare in favor of woman's suffrage, in your Nashville address. Will
you favor us with a declaration as
to whether you approve or disapprove
vote for women?
"MRS.   L.    C.   FRENCH,
"President  Knoxville   Equal   Suffrage
League."</dc:description>
