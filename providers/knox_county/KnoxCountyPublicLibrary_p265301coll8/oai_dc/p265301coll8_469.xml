JANE ADDAMS ON
CHICAGO'S CHANGE
Shows   immediate    Results      of    Vote
in      Garbage      and      Police-Women   Reforms
Jane Addams was one of the speakers at a luncheon recently given in
 Washington by the National College
 Equal Suffrage league. She said that
 the women of Illinois had found their
influence much increased since they
 got the ballot. Illustrating this, Miss
 Addams continued:
"Miss Mary McDowell had been
 greatly interested in the garbage ques-
tion for many years, because the big-
gest garbage dump in Chicago is in
her ward, and the garbage has simply
been put there and allowed to decay.
She has interviewed all manner of
committees and officials, without re-
sult. Within two weeks after the wo-
man suffrage law went into effect,
 Miss McDowell was appointed a
member of a garbage committee, made
up mostly of aldermen, with one or two physicians&#8212;a committee with
 $10,000 to spend. In all likelihood this
would not have happened but for wo-
man suffrage.
   "We had been trying    for      a    long
 time,   without   success,   to   secure   the
appointment   of     police-women.       We
wanted   them   especially  to  look  after
girls  at dance    halls      and    in    other
places  of public recreation. After wo-
man  suffrage was granted ten police-
women   were  appointed  very   quickly
 with  full police powers.
     "Judge   Owens,   who   makes  the   ar-
rangements for the city elections, has
 issued  an   order   asking for   1,400  women
  volunteers   to  serve  as       judges
and  clerks of election in    every    pre-
cinct.  The pay is $5 per day, and the
work will cover about 20  days  In the
 course   of   a  year,   including  the    va-
rious elections, and the    time    needed
for counting the ballots. Judge Owens
is establishing so    many      precedents
 that   I   think  the  opponents  of   equal
rights  will  never  be   able  to  get   the
 women  out.
"Our experience    in    Illinois    has
thoroughly exploded the idea that wo-
men  have more  respect and influence
 without   a   vote.     Every   woman   who
 has  been  to the  city hall  or  has  had
 anything to do with city officials has
 observed a very    striking    change    in
 their  demeanor since the woman suf-
frage  bill   passed.    They    are      much more  respectful  and  gallant.
'Miss   Harriet   Vittum,   president   of
Women's City club,  has been try-
ing to get an ordinance for the better
ventilation  of the   five-cent     theatres,
and so she has  had to go to the city
hall a great deal,  and to see    various
committees.  She says that "before woman  suffrage  they   were    polite     (of
course,   they  are  too   good  politicians
to be otherwise), but that since then
they have been cordial, and are ab-
solutely tumbling over themselves to
meet the wishes of the women."
SOUTHERN WOMAN
EXONERATES   PAUL
Asks  Why     Literal     Application
Teachings  is      Confined    to    Single
Point
In the Atlanta Constitution Mrs. J.
K. Ottley reviews with much force
the anti-suffrage argument lately put
forth by a Savannah judge, who based it largely on Paul. Mrs. Ottley asks
why we should insist upon a literal
application to our day of Paul's rules
for the Corinthians on this one question, when we have ceased to do it on
so many others. Thus Paul devotes
thirteen verses to the impropriety of
a woman's "praying unto God with
uncovered head," yet in a crowded,
modern church women are often ask-
ed to remove their picture hats for
the greatest good of the greatest number. Mrs. Ottley gives other instances
and  says:
"It seems to me a little hard on
Paul, who gave us some of our most
wonderful messages of great abiding
spiritual truth, that he should be so
constantly brought forward and quoted, not for his great essential inspiration, but in the light of some detailed
instructions which he gave to the
near-Pagan Corinthians 2,000 years
ago. We do not observe these Corinthian  rules,  as  indeed      why     should we?"
WANTED   A   VOTE.
A prize was lately won by the following limerick, written by Mrs.
John B. Parker, a member of the
Era club of New Orleans:
There once was a woman of note
Who  very much wanted to vote;
Her  neighbors   said  "Here,
You stay in your sphere;
Go home and have babies to tote!"
She then formed   a club literary,
Which  studied  child-life,   civics      and
dairy;
They found out their right
To make the world  bright,
and decent, and home-like and cheery.
They studied of home and the nation,
And learned to each the relation,
"We'll  have  better laws,"
Said these women,  "because
We'll  work  for  our country's  salvation."
And now in ten states women vote
On  questions both  near and remote;
"Our banner's unfurled
And our sphere is the word,"
Says this  wonderful  woman  of note.</dc:description>
