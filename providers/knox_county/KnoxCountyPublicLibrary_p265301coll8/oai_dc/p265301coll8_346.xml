<dc:description>The man is interested in his children
and, knowing their needs, should have a
voice in making laws for their welfare and
protection. 
The woman is interested in her children,
and having a keener sense of their needs
should have a voice in making laws for
their welfare and protection. There is no
argument for his right to vote that does
not apply with equal propriety for her
right to vote.
