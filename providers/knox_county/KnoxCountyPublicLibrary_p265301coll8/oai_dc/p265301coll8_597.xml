<dc:description>REGISTRATION POINTS NAMED
Commission Receives Qualifications of Registrars.
Attention of Voters   Called   to
Necessity of  Re-Registering
for Elections.
Places where registration booths will
be established in the various precincts
in the city and county were named at a
meeting of the election commission held 
here yesterday.
The commission also received the
qualifications of the newly appointed
registrars who will conduct the general
registration to begin on Aug. 11 and end 
on Aug. 21.
Members of the commission wish to 
impress on all voters that the coming
registration is held in compliance with 
the biennial registration laws, and it
will be necessary for all voters to procure a registration receipt in order to 
participate in the municipal elections. 
Although the next meeting date of the 
commission has not been determined, it
is probable the body will meet about the
20th of this month to appoint election
officers for the municipal elections, and 
to make other arrangements for the 
elections. 
This meeting will be one of the most 
important held by the commission since
the new members were inducted into office two months ago.

Sixth district&#8212;Miss Jean Crawford,
democrat, chairman; Mrs. M. Jacobs,
vice-chairman.
Although any plan may be followed
by the chairman in organizing her
district, the most popular plan has
been found to have a chairman and
vice-chairman of the district; chairman, vice-chairman, secretary and
treasurer for each ward in the district; and a chairman for each block
in the ward, this chairman also to
have a corps of assistants.
Probably the most organization
work yet done has been in the sixth
district under the leadership of Miss
Jean Crawford. This district is already fairly well organized in the
manner explained. The second ward
is also proceeding rapidly with its
organization work under the direction
of Miss Kate White.
The purpose of the meeting this afternoon was to fill in all vacancies
which had existed in the initial organization work, in order that tne
ward organization work could get
under way as soon as possible. In
the near future a meeting will be
held when it is hoped to have a large
representation from each ward in the
city.
A vice-president and a corresponding secretary of the League of Women Voters were due to be elected
this afternoon.</dc:description>
