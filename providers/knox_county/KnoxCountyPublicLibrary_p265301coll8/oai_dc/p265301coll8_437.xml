<dc:description>A WRONG IDEA OF JUSTICE
We have found many of Mrs.
L.    Graham   Crozier's   articles
well worth printing,   and   have
always given her space in the
Herald to   express   her   views.
But we are not at all in accord
with her in her views regarding
Fatty Arbuckle. We are considerably disappionted in the action
she has taken as a member of
the "Better Films"   committee
of Knoxville. Recently the committee passed resolutions calling
on the local theatres to refuse
thefe Arbuckle films entrance to
their theatres.    With   the   exception of Mrs. Orozier, the club
was   unanimous   in asking   it.
Mrs. Crozier comes out in defense of Arbuckle, saying that
"in the name   of   justice"   he
should be   permitted   the same
rights   as before his trial   for
murder, inasmuch as the courts
declared him innocent   of   the
murder of a movie actress.    We
want to ask if Mrs. Crozier or
anybody else really believes Arbuckle is blameless of the death
of Virginia Rappe ?   Mrs. Crozier   should   certainly   be   old
enough to know that   it   is almost an impossibility to punish
&#187; man who had   the   financial
backing that was lined up in defense of Arbuckle, and his escape was freely predicted long
before the trial   began.   While
the courts   turned   him   loose,
there is no reason why decent
people should   come   to his defense and help further to whitewash him.    His films are being
outlawed in most cities, and we
have no doubt Knoxville people
will   do   likewise.   Fatty   can
never come back as a comedian.
Every time he tries to get funny
or do anything to make folks
laugh, the ghost   of   Virginia
Rappe will rise up to plague him.
A higher court than the California tribunal has already passed
judgment on him, and it would
be impossible for him to produce
funny films again.     The   only
hope for Fatty's existence is to
return to the Los Angeles saloon
and work at his old job of cleaning spittoons.</dc:description>
