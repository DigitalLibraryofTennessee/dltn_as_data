<dc:description>MRS. L. C. FRENCH HEADS
STATE SUFFRAGE LEAGUE
The executive committee of the
Tennesseee Equal Suffrage league
has named Mrs. L. Crozier French of
Knoxville, president succeeding Miss
Sarah B. Elliott, resigned. Nashville
was selected as the convention city
for the national gathering.
Mrs. L. Crozier French is one of
the most prominent woman's suffrage 
leaders in the south, and is also widely known wherever woman's suffrage
leagues are organized as one of the
strongest champions of women's
rights. She has been heard in addresses in many states and cities in
the   interest   of   votes   for   women.
Mrs. French organized the Knoxville Equal Suffrage league and has
been active in the league since its
inception. She is a member of the executive council of the state league.&#8212;
