<dc:description>GOOD CITIZENSHIP CLASS
TO HOLD CALLED MEETING
It had been decided that the class in
citizenship would not meet in April, but
the decision of the supreme court on
April 9, on the legality of the ratification of the 19th amendment of the federal constitution by the Tennessee legislature and the passage by this legislature of several laws of special interest to women, has, in the opinion of the
chairman made a meeting this week almost imperative.
Thursday at the Lawson McGhee library, promptly at 3 o'clock. The meeting will be held and the following resolution submitted to the class:
"In commemoration of the making of
the Volunteer state the 'perfect thirty-
six' of the union, it is recommended
that April 9th be celebrated in Tennessee as Citizens' day."
All interested in state laws are invited
to attend.
