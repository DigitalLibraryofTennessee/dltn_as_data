<dc:description>Suffrage Tactics.
Plans are swinging rapidly for
for the conventions of the congressional
union and the woman's party to meet
in Washington during inauguration
week, March 1, 2, 3 and 4, 1917.
Women suffrage is lending a complimentary indorsement  to "watchful waiting" that fully warrants President Wi-l
son in taking off his hat to the sentries
in courteous salutation.&#8212;-Washington. D. C, Star., Jan. 20.
    After six state referendums South Da
kota   has   begun   the   fight   for   the   en-
franchisement of Dakota women through
 the   Susan   B.   Anthony   amendment   to
the constitution.
     Secretary    of    War    Baker    strongly
urged     presidential     suffrage     for    the
women of Ohio   to members of   the state
legislature     who   called     upon   him     in 
Cleveland last week.
     "There is far less excuse now than in 
any previous congress for shoving woman 
suffrage   into  the   closet   and   slamming
the door on it.    The democrats acknowl- 
edge that but for the women voters their 
jobholders would now be facing the un-
happy future of working for a living."&#8212;
 Newark, N. J.. Evening Star.
Australia   recently  paid   an  honor   to 
womanhood.     Mrs.   Kate    Dwyer,     the 
leader of the labor women of New South 
Wales   was recently appointed to a seat
on the senate of the University of Sydney, 
 with life tenure.     This is the  first
time that a woman has been called upon
to   fill   such   a   position   in the British Dominions.

A bill for presidential suffrage will be
introduced in practically every statu leg-
islature in session this winter.    The Illi-
nois act,  which grants the franchise to 
women  in   presidential    and    municipal 
elections,  will be used as a model measure.</dc:description>
