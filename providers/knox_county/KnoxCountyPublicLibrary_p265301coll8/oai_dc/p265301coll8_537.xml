<dc:description>Women Voters Reaffirm Their
Confidence In Committee Of 18.
Resolution Passed Explaining Why No Women Were
Named To Run For Council On People's Ticket.
Plans Are Materializing.
Members of Knox County League
of Women Voters reaffirmed their
confidence in the Committee of
Eighteen Thursday afternoon with
the passage of a resolution based on
the statement issued some days ago
to the women of the city at large.
The resolution was offered by Miss
Ada Fanz and received only one dissenting vote. The statement embodied in the resolution reads as follows :
The Knox County League of
Women Voters has complete confidence in the men and women of
the Nominating Committee of the
People's ticket and we know that
they are not opposed to women in
public office.
We know that the absence of a
woman candidate  for position  of
Council-woman-at-large is due to
the refusal of a number of representative women who declined to
make the race after earnest solicitation on the part of the committee.    The refusal of these  women
to run was not due to any belief in
the   inferiority   of   their  sex,     but
was  due   to   their   conviction   that
 the   wider   experience   of    men   in
public work best    fitted     them to
inaugurate   a   new   form   of     City
Government.
We believe that the office should
seek the-woman and not the woman the office, and we deplore the
action   of  any  woman  running in
opposition   to   the   selected   candi-
dates of the People's Ticket.
The  division  in  the  Knox County
League of Women Voters over the
endorsement of the People's ticket
and the candidacy of Mrs. L. Crazier
French was discussed by a number
of the league members, among them
Mrs. S. L. Branch, who is manager
of Mrs. French's campaign. The
feeling was freely expressed by both
sides that while there was a differ-
ence of opinion all personalities,
veiled or openly expressed, should
be done away with and that the
separate campaigns be waged on a
high plane.
In view of the misunderstanding
that had seemed to exist, Mrs. W. L.
Morris read a telegram from Mrs.
Katherine P. Kenny, state president of the League of Women Voters
to the effect that Miss Mary Boyce
Temple is the representative of this
district on the state executive board
of the league, instead of Mrs. C. A.
Weaver, who was succeeded in
January by  Miss Temple.
The secretary read a letter also
from Mrs. Kenney voicing confidence in the work that the Knox
County league  is doing.
Reports of district chairmen on
registration indicated that plans of
the league in the interest of registration are materializing and that
the organization for the campaign is
going rapidly forward. At the next
meeting workers and watchers at
the   polls  will  be  chosen.
Purchase of a certified copy of
the city charter was authorized.
Names of two new members, Mrs.
M. R. Harrison and Mrs. Ignaz 
Fanz  were   announced.</dc:description>
