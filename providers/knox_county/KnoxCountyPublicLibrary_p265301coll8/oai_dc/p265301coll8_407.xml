<dc:description>WOMEN TO PRESS POLITICAL FIGHT
Republican and Democratic Organi-
zations Prepare to Renew Their Efforts.
There was a marked difference in   the 
atmosphere pervading the women's demo-
cratic and the women's republican head- 
quarters yesterday.   The democratic women
were at their desks early, and stayed 
late.    And they wore a cheerful smile.
  At   the   headquarters   of the   National
Women's Campaign Committee of the Re-
publican  National   Committee,   at No.  511
Fifth avenue, it looked as if nearly every-
body had moved out.    Few were at their
desks, and those who were there left early.
Their expressions were as dreary as the
deserted rooms, which a few days ago were
seething with enthusiasm and excitement.
The   democratic   women   have   called   a
meeting thus afternoon at five o'clock at
house of Mrs. Henry Morgenthau, No.
20 West Seventy-second street, to form a
permanent  organization.   Mrs. Mary Ware Dennett, 
 the executive   secretary   of   the
Women's Bureau of the   Democratic National Committee, which has-contributed a great
deal to the campaign, said a  state-
ment would be given out then announcing the
progress   made   by   the   bureau    and that
the organization would be definitely formed 
 to work for democratic principles and
candidates.
Mrs. Dennett had this to say about the election:_
tion:&#8212;
'President Wilson has put the Wall
street lobby out of business, a feat that
no other President of the United States
has accomplished. The officers and mem-
bers of our bureau are entirely satisfied
to-day that election returns give adequate
proof of justification for their policy,
adopted early in the campaign&#8212;'get the
facts to the voters; their common sense 
will do the rest.' "
Refusing to admit, that they are worsted,
the republican Women also are preparing
to renew their efforts politically. Miss
Helen Varick Boswell, director of the National Women's Campaign Committee,
said, in regard to the probable election of
Mr.   Wilson:&#8212;
"Republican   women    are    disappointed
but not dismayed at the result of the elec-
tion.   Seeing the need for education in
principles of the republican party in the
home, in the State and in the nation,
National   Women's   Republican   Associa-
tion will make greater effort than in the 
past to be the educational medium of
republican principles."</dc:description>
