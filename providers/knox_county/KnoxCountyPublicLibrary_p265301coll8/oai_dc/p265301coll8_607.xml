<dc:description>They arose
in turn, and each was given a round
of applause.
 At   this     juncture     Representative
Joe Harris shouted, "Let's go home."
Representative Joe Wade of Knox
county, was not content, however,
with a mere introduction, and insisted that he be permitted to speak.
He entered into an extended discussion of details incident to the consideration and enactment of the suffrage legislation. Three time's during his discourse Mrs. French sounded the gavel, as if to cut short the
speaker's time, but despite this he
continued
Commissioner Neal Adams, whom
Mr. Wade had put on the defensive,
was then introduced. He said he
went to Nashville in behalf of the city
park bill and the Victory Memorial
bill and the suffrage bill, and did all
he could in the interest of these.
"What about your board bill?' exclaimed  a  legislator.
Representative Joe Harris, of Knox
spoke briefly, also having asked the
privilege  of  being  heard.
Representative Larson of Shelby,
was then called upon by Mrs. French
and in his speech he made especial
reference to the depricated possibility
of non-partisanism among women
voters, saying ihat every woman
should affiliate with one party or another.
This concluded the festivities, and
at 9:15 o'clock Mrs. French announced "the meeting is adjourned sine
die."
Felicitating Mrs. French upon the
success of the occasion, one gentleman present remarked. "You had a
good show and you made a splendid
ringmaster   Mrs.    French."
"Ringmaster is right," replied the
veteran suffragist, who now demures
to that designation, affirming that
no longer is she a "suffragist" but
now is a  "voter."</dc:description>
