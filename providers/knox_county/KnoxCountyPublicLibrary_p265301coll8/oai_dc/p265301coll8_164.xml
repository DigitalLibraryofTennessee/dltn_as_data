<dc:description>"I am owner of the Sphere,
Of the seven stars and the solar year,
Of Caesar's  hand and  Plato's  brain,
Of   Lord   Christ's   heart   and   Shakespeare's  strain."
This was the keynote to Mrs. L.
Crozier French's brilliant and interesting talk yesterday afternoon at the
Carnegie Library at 3:30 o'clock be-
fore a large and representative audi-
ence. The speaker was introduced with
a happy speech by Mr. G. H. Baskette.
"Unity and Individuality," the topic
chosen by Mrs. French, was intelligent-
ly and cleverly handled. The quotations taken from the theories of eminent philosophers and scientist's who
have expressed their views along this
line, of Time, Space, Mind, Force, Matter, Motion, Life, Law, Light, Love,
Cause, Consequence, Circles, Color,
Chord, were dissected and interpreted
intelligentily, she also giving her own
ideas along these lines. The application of her subject was taken in like
manner:
"The family, The Duties of Each
Member;" "Mother's Liberties;"
"Fathers' Privileges;" "Children's
Freedom;" "What About Punishment?"
"Who Is Mistress of the Kitchen?"
The talk was delightfully informal,
many of her hearers asking questions
in regard to her subject. Her subject
this afternoon at the same hour at the
library will be on "Dual Forces." She
will treat of the dual Sources in nature,
art  and literature.
On Saturday afternoon at 3 o'clock
Mock Congress will take place, tendered by Mrs. L. Crozier French to the
club women of Nashville as an acknowledgement of the many courtesies
extended to her during her visit.
The  Call.
Notice is hereby given that on April
23, 1910, at Nashville, Tenn., will be
held a national congress of women to
discuss the most practical and effective
means of inducing governments to
give official recognition of the influence of women in human affairs by
establishing a department which shall
be the instrument by which this influence may be focussed and used as
the most important factor in social
progress.
Each state is entitled to four delegates. The credential card shall contain the name and address of, the delegate with the endorsement of the wife
of the governor of the state. As the
delegates must be individualized (if
married) it is desired that all such
subscribe themselves, giving name and
maiden name and a hyphen before the
husband's name which latter must be
spelled with a small letter.
No   delegate   will   be   allowed   from
Utah,     Wyoming,   Idaho     or   Colorado
having mired in the dirty Pool of politics. They are unfitted to associate with
women of influence.
