<dc:description>ONE RESOLUTION
THAT WAS SIDE-STEPPED
At the East Tennessee Teachers
Association held in this city on March
21 and 22, a resolution endorsing the
election of women on boards of Education was submitted to the resolution committee. This was calmly ignored by the committee. In his report, the chairman of the committee
referred to a "tabled" resolution, but
not till afterward did any but a
chosen few know what that resolution
contained.
This committee submitted excellent
resolutions of commendation and
thanks to the state superintendent and
our present legislature for their great
educational work. It was also very
careful to thank everybody connected
with the management of the convention.
But doesn't it seem too bad that
this committee did not seize the
chance to make the Association stand
for progressive, fair-minded justice?
It seems superfluous to tarry to defend this resolution. Any one can
easily see that an educated woman,
who is not a wage earner, could make
a more efficient member of a board
of education than a busy man of affairs. What time have business men
to study the problems of school organizations? Or to investigate the
present school conditions? Absolutely
none.
About four-fifths of the members of
the East Tennessee Teacher's Association are women and these poor confiding creatures never dreamed that
they wore being betrayed but played
"Mutt to their Jeff" most beautifully.
But like Mutt they will sometime
"fall on" and then.&#8212;
&#8212;MAE TREADWELL.	
Dost thou hear the bugle calling&#8212;
Calling thee to take the field?
'Tis a battle all are waging;
Thou must fight or thou must yield.
'Tis the battle of the ages&#8212;
No man may the gage refuse;
Eight on one side or the other&#8212;
No man can decline to choose.
If from off the field thou fliest,
Even then thou art a foe;
Who" for Truth no sword uplifteth,
He for Error strikes a blow.
He who bravely fights must conquer;
None can e'er defeat be;
For to soldiers in God's battle
Death itself is victory.
From the hymns of the REV. MINOT
