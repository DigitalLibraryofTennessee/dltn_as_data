<dc:description>Campaign After Thursday.
Mrs. Thomas Peacock Miller, chair-
man of the league, stated just before
the meeting adjourned that after regis-
tering closes Thursday night members
of the league and candidates will be at
liberty to carry on campaigns for them-
selves   or   anyone   else   they   are   inter -
ested in.    Ward committees of the Non
Partisan league will try to invite all
candidates to address them at meetings
to be held in the near future and every
effort will be made to give all candidates equal opportunities to state their
reasons for candidacy.
