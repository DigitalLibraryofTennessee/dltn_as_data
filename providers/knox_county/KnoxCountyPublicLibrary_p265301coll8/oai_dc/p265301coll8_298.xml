<dc:description>MENTAL ARITHMETIC

By Alice S. Cheyney
Ten  little  reasons  why  a vote  she
would decline!
She stepped into a meeting, and came
out with only nine.
Nine  anti  arguments,  time  worn  in
debate!
The times  bring suffrage  new ones,
so they've left her only eight.
Eight anti instincts, she says come
straight from Heaven!
She has a sense of humor, though, so
holds to only seven.
Seven reasons why "the home" and
politics won't mix!
They've  taken  the  sweeper  off  her
street, and now there 're only
six.
Six   little  reasons  why  the  suffrage
cause can't thrive!
The men are going over, though, and
soon there's only five.
Five reasons!   But she's ready now to
think about it more,
So friends have sent her pamphlets
till she clings to only four.
Four faithful reasons she thinks must
ever be!
Until she  takes  the  Journal,  which
leaves a shaky three.
(missing)  are    many
things no lady ought to do!
The antis now do all of them, and
leave her only two.
Two left! But she will finish now
what is so well begun.
Her husband's asking questions, and
has left her only one.
One  little  reason  left  why  suffrage
 may be wrong!   
An anti  tried to win her back, and
now she's for us, strong!</dc:description>
