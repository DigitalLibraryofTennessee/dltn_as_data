<dc:description>MUST WORK FOR POSTERITY
ASSERTS SUFFRAGIST HEAD
To obtain the best possible fathers
all men must be taught justice.
Must Share in Making Laws.
To  obtain   the  best  possible  condi-
tions under which children may grow
to  maturity,  women  must    share     in
 making the laws in the    shadow    of
 which they and their children     must
live.
She who is not afraid to face    the
 world to  obtain these  things is    womanly
A woman is most truly womanly
who is most truly the universal mother.
A  womanly   woman   does  not     rest
content  before  her own hearth while 
the  children  of   others  less  fortunate 
women perish because of    man-made
laws.
Gives Thought to Her Sister
     A   womanly   woman   does   not   rest
content in her  own home while    her
sister wanders the  street homeless.
A womanly woman is not too concerned with her own life and duties to 
remember the rights of other women.
The woman who endeavors to in- 
fluence the minds of others because 
she is a woman is not womanly. The
woman who appeals for justice on 
intellectual grounds in the world of 
things is womanly.
The willingness to  fight    for    that
which is right is womanly.
She Works for Posterity.
The womanly woman, when she}
hears that her functions in life is hard i
and that the road she must travel is!
stony and tiresome, prays in her heart'
to be shown the way to make it less
hard and stony and tiresome for those
who come after her.
A womanly woman does not cry for
a change in her duties, but only that
she may learn to understand better
exactly what her duties are and be
willing to shoulder the full responsibility of them.
A womanly woman knows that
while she forgets her duty towards
others her duty toward herself is unperformed.
Should Respect Self First.
The womanly woman cannot reach
the best within herself while she labors beneath a sense of inequality. She
knows that to have others respect her
she must first be able to respect herself.
The womanly woman knows the pur-
poses of the two sexes can never be
identical and that therefore the world
walks lame till both sexes are permitted to work equally and freely for
their common good.
She who is truly womanly cannot
be harmed by contact with the world.
She goes out into the world and labors to convert the world to the stand-
ards of true womanliness.&#8212;Washing
