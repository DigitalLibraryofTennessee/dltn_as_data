<dc:description>WOMEN MUST GIVE EXACT AGE
IN REGISTERING IN COUNTY
Commission Will Sustain Registrars in Demand That All Seeking to Qualify as Voters Give Exact Age&#8212;Members of
Various Boards Being Sworn in Today With Few Changes
in Personnel.
Mirabile dictu!
The Knox county election commis.-
sion today ruled that women must
tell their exact age to qualify themselves to register in the general biennial registration which will begin
Monday morning in Knoxville and
Knox county and will continue
through August    18.
Roy H. Beeler, chairman of the
election commission, stated this
morning that he will sustain any and
all registrars who require of each
and every woman as a qualification
to register that she reveal her exact
ag[e] in answering the question as to
age contained in the list of questions
necessary to  qualify  registrants.
Hal H. Clements, secretary of the
board, stated that he also will vote
to sustain all registrars who require
women registrants to tell their ages.
Just the mere statement that they are
over twenty-one years of age will not
suffice," Mr. Clements said. "The
women now have got into politics
and they must be reconciled to complying with all of the requirements,"
Mr.  Clements said.
To Sustain Registrars.
Captain Mitchell Long, third mem-
ber of the election board, stated that
he would vote with the other members of the election commission to
sustain registrars in this matter. So
that makes the board unanimous.
The question of requiring women
to tell their ages as a pre-requisite
to registering arose this morning 
when one of the registrars who had 
been sworn in took Captain Long
aside and questioned him about as
follows: "What are we going to do
about these women refusing to tell
their ages?" Captain Long told the
registrar that he would sustain him
in compelling such women to tell
their ages. The question seemed to
be settled when all of the members
of the commission fell in line.
Registrars in the past have reported to the election commission that
many women would not tell their ages
further than to say they were over
twenty-one years old, and many
were allowed to register with this
limited  information.
The election commission was busy 
this morning swearing in registrars
from over the city and county. The
following oath was administered to
each.
"I John Doe, do solemnly swear (or
affirm) that I will faithfully and impartially keep the register of voters
in my district, (or ward) that I will
not knowingly register or allow to
be registered, any person not a legally qualified voter, and that I will not
knowingly prevent any from registering who is a legally qualified voter,
so help  me God.
"Signed. "
Registration books in the city and
county precincts will be opened each
morning at 8 o'clock and will close
at 9 o'clock. It was stated this morning that no one will be permitted
to act as a registrar who has not
been duly sworn, but while sworn
registrars are supposed to stay with
their books, they may have clerks to
do the writing for them, if this will
facilitate registration. But no neglect
on the part of the registrars will be
tolerated, and they, being under oath
will be held responsible for any work
or action of a clerk or substitute.
The registrars for Knoxville and
Knox county appointed by the election commission and the places of
registration in the respective precincts follow:
