  <abstract>The scrapbook includes newspaper clippings and ephemera concerning women's groups involved in the fight for suffrage at the Knoxville and state levels, as well as other women's issues such as temperance. Each of the fragile items in this scrapbook has been treated by a conservator and will also be entered as a single item in the Women's Suffrage Collection.</abstract>
