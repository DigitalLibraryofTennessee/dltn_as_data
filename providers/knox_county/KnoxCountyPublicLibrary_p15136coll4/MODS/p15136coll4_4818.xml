  <abstract>Watercolor portrait of Jane Huff Stokely (1785-1865). She was born in VA, the daughter of John Huff and Elinor Corder Huff, who moved to Cocke County, Tennessee, when she was a small child. She and her brother Isaac were scalped by Indians and left for dead in 1792. She survived and always wore a bonnet to cover her scalp. She married Royal Stokely in 1805 and became the mother of ten children. The family lived in the Del Rio community. (See article by Eddie Walker, Newport Plain Talk, July 17, 1996). The portrait was formerly identified as Patience McKay Fine and was exhibited in the Museum of East Tennessee History under that name. Small 3 x 2" watercolor portrait (Artifact 2014.006.001) was removed from frame (Artifact 2014.006.002).</abstract>
