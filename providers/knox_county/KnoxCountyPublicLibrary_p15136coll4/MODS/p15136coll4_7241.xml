  <abstract>Extracts from The Autobiography of a Cherokee Chief. Lyon's View. By John J. Craig. Translated from the Original Manuscript by Miss Mamie C. [Craig]. ***** John J. Craig (1820-1892) came to Knoxville in 1839 from his native Alabama. In Knoxville he was married to Mary C. Lyons, whose family home was on the property that is now known as Lakeshore Park. Craig was one of the pioneers of the Knoxville marble industry, when he founded John J. Craig Co. in 1878 and later its subsidiary Candoro Marble Works, one of the foremost producers of pink Tennessee marble. In 1889, when this booklet was written, the Lyons property (now Lakeshore Park) had recently been acquired by the state of Tennessee for construction of the East Tennessee Hospital for the Insane, which opened in 1886.</abstract>
