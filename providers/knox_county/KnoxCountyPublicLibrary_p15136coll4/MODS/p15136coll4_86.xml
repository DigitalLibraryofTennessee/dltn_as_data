  <abstract>John H. Shields Plot &amp; Property, Knoxville, TN. 129 acres east of the creek. Detail of 1859 map showing unusual Octagon house site. Located on the northeast corner of First Creek and Howard Street (near present day Linden Avenue). The area was known as Shieldstown. The property was purchased by John H. Shields and his wife Margaret from William H. Sneed in 1854 as part of a 152 acre tract along First Creek. John H. Shields left Tennessee in October 1865. At some point the Octagon house burned. In 1890 a house was built near the site by Magnolia Bryan Branner, widow of E.C. Branner.</abstract>
