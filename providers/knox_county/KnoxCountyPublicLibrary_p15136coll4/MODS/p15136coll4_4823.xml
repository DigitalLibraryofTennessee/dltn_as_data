  <abstract>Artifact 2016.001 “Battle of Fort Saunders [Sanders] Nov. 29, 1863” streetcar token. On verso, “West End ST. R .R./ ONE FARE”. See related article in The Knoxville Journal 11-29-1938. The token was the same size as later tokens but one cent cheaper. Used on the mule or horse drawn streetcars. West Knoxville was a separate incorporated town from 1888 until 1897. “The Battle of Fort Saunders” (as spelled on the token) was commemorated on the West End car line fare, the only line of which approached the historic battlefield, which was all of West Knoxville, with the fortifications on top of Fort Sanders Hill. The line was a single track and proceeded from the Hotel Imperial down Clinch Avenue, 15th Street to Cumberland Avenue, and down Temple Avenue to Circle Park. 1 token (small hole on one side). 3/4” diameter.</abstract>
