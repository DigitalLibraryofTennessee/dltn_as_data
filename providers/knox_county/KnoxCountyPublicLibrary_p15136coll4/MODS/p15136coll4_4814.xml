  <abstract>David A. Deaderick gold nugget watch fob. David Anderson Deaderick (1797-1873) went to the California gold rush in 1849 with the East Tennessee Gold Mining Company. He did not strike gold, but came back with a gold nugget he had made into a watch fob with a stone (possibly amethyst or colored glass) inlaid on the end, ca. 1852. His initials ‘DAD’ were etched into the stone. The family kept the fob for many years. A biographical sketch of David Anderson Deaderick appears in The French Broad-Holston County: A History of Knox County, Tennessee, Mary U. Rothrock, editor, on pages 409-411. Donated on behalf of the Deaderick Family.</abstract>
