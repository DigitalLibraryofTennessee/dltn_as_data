  <abstract>Wiley Oakley (1885-1954) was famous in the early twentieth century as the "Roamin Man of the Mountains." He became well known as a guide in the Great Smoky Mountains during the years before the park was proposed. He also became well known as a story teller and spinner of yarns, compared to Will Rogers. As the park progressed, Wiley was one of the best known guides in the Smoky Mountains. In the 1930s he opened a shop in Gatlinburg as tourism began to increase. The sign at the first shop location had a message in large letters--"Antiques made to order." The later Wiley Shop which featured hand-made artifacts, souvenirs and mountain music by the Wiley band. Admission was free but tourists were urged to make a donation and buy a souvenir. This jug was an advertising piece for the Wiley Shop.
