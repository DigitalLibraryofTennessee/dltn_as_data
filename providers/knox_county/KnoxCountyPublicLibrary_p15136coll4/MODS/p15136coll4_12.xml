  <abstract>Tennessee's Shame! Convicts in the Coal Creek Mines. [1892]. "Vote for TURNEY for Governor and WELCKER for Congress, if you wish this to continue. Vote for WINSTEAD for Governor and HOUK for Congress, if you wish to abolish this great crime, which has so long been committed in order to raise Democratic funds from the lessees" Captions: 'Convicts at work' and 'One of the results--starvation. The father and husband has gone to a distant State for work.' Peter Turney won the election of 1892 and inherited the convict lease system.
