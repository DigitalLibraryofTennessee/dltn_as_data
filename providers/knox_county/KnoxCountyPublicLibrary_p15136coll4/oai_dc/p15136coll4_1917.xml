<dc:description>SAVED!  All the tedious and tiresome labor of
BURRING &amp; PICKING
YOUR WOOL BY HAND.
I have used the Burring Machine for one season, and find
that it will clean  Wool   from all  BURRS, STICKS, TRASH,
DYE CHIPS, &amp;c., more thoroughly, and with less waste or injury than if picked by hand, for which work I CHARGE
NOTHING. My Carding Machine is in thorough repair, and
partly clothed with   NEW CARDS.
Wash your wool thoroughly, grease it well, and send it
along and I will guarantee you get the best of rolls. I will receive wool and return it every week, from May 30th, to
Nov. 30th, without extra charge, at the following places:
McMullen &amp; Craig, Grocery Merchants,  Opera  House Cor-
net, Knoxville, Tenn.
Mann &amp; Co., dealers in Dry Goods and Groceries, East side
Market Square, Knoxville,
Armstrong's Ferry, Holston River.
TERMS, 8 1/3 CTS. PER POUND FOR PLAIN, AND 1 1/2J CTS.
FOR MIXED WOOL. PAYMENT REQUIRED ON DELIVERY.
My Machine is located 6 miles East of Knoxville, on the
E. T., Va. &amp; Ga. R. R. Give me a trial and be convinced for
yourself.
ROBERT ARMSTRONG.
