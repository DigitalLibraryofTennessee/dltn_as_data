See related article in The Knoxville Journal 11-29-1938. The token was the same size as later tokens but one cent cheaper. Used on the mule or horse drawn streetcars. West Knoxville was a separate incorporated town from 1888 until 1897.

The line was a single track and proceeded from the Hotel Imperial down Clinch Avenue, 15th Street to Cumberland Avenue, and down Temple Avenue to Circle Park.    1 token (small hole on one side).  3/4&#8221; diameter.
