<dc:description>THE INITIAL GRAND ANNUAL PICNIC! 
OF THE KNOXVILLE
LITERARY CLUB! THE EVENT OF THE SEASON. 
Wednesday, May 26th, 1880,
BEGINNING AT 2:45, and CLOSING AT 10 P. M.
UNPRECEDENTED AGGREGATION OF THE
Chivalry, Beauty and Intellect OF KNOXVILLE. 
The Members will assemble at the corner of Cumberland and
Walnut Streets, whence the CLUB will proceed through the principal streets of the city, HEADED by the World-Renowned and
Inimitable ROME (GA) Silver CORNET and TROMBONE    BAND !
(if the effort to secure the band fails, J. W. Caldwell, Esq. will deliver an oration from his buggy
as the Club passes along the streets.)
The Members will go in buggies, each buggy to contain one lady
and one gentleman, an arrangement made at the urgent solicitation of a
prominent member.
Sumptuous Ices and dulcet Confects will abound, and each lady is expected to furnish one cake and such substantials as her judgment may
suggest. As these latter are intended to be eaten, it is NOT obligatory
upon the ladies to give' the COOKING their personal attention.
At the BANQUET the following SUBLIME Sentiments will be proposed :&#8212;
1   THE LADIES, Hon. W. P. Washturn.
2 THE GENTLEMEN, Miss Mary Park.
3 BUGGIES, Prof. Wm. G. Brown.
4 CAKE,       Leonidas Jourolman
5 CANDY, D. B. Johnson, Esq.
(This last selection is made in recognition of Prof. Johnson's unswerving devotion to CANDY.)  
6 SANDWICHES, Simpson Cornick.
7   THE LITERARY CLUB,      Miss Mary Temple and Col. Jno. M. Fleming.
Col. White will then read an "ORIGINAL" poem on Spring!
EXECUTIVE COMMITEE.
Prof. W. G. BROWN.   LEON JOUROLMON,   C. M. McCLUNG.
The names of these gentlemen are a guaranty of success and pleasure. Mr Jourolmon, the Chairman, has been the leading spirit of innumerable Sunday-School Picnics, and will bring to the discharge
of his duties an invaluable fund of experience, which, added to his impressive dignity of character and
encyclopaedic erudition, affords infallible assurance of the success of any PICNIC to which he may
devote his energies.
The other gentlemen of the Committee are COMPARATIVELY YOUNG AND UNKNOWN, but
there can be no doubt of their efficiency under able and distinguished supervision.
