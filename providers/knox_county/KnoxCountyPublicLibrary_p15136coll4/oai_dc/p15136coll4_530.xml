The view from the verandas of the hotel is one of the most beautiful in America, the whole
valley of East Tennessee is spread out in panoramic view, from the great Smokies on the
East to the Cumberland Plateau on the West.
Dupont Springs is a quiet, restful resort; you do not get lonesome, the magnificent view of
the valley is ever changing, often the clouds will fill the valley below, and you can see it
rain below you, while you are in the bright sunshine above. All of this from the hotel. You
do not have to walk to enjoy it; if you are fond of walking or riding, you can walk for miles
along level roads without the fatigue or discomfort of mountain climbing. There is something to interest you every moment of the day, and you have never witnessed more beautiful sunrises and sunsets, than you can from this place. The lights of Knoxville are visible at night, twinkling like stars.
The water, though strong in mineral properties, containing Iron,Lithia, Magnesia and Sulphur, is pleasant to the taste. There is also a fine Freestone Spring convenient to the hotel.
