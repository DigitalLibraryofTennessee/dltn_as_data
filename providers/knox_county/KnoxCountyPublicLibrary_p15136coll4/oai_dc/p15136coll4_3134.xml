<dc:description>'No More Shall the War Cry Sever'
75 Years Ago Today Fort Sanders Hill Ran Red With Blood
of 392 Confederate Soldiers
By JOHN   S. VAN GILDER
Especially Written For The Knoxville News-Sentinel of November 29, 1938.
Early this morning, the milkmen,
quietly placed their white bottles
around West Knoxville in the vicinity of Fort Sanders Manor and Fort
Sanders Hospital. Alarm clocks
woke peacefully sleeping mothers,
fathers and children. Hot breakfasts were comfortably eaten.
Happy school boys and girls
romped down the streets toward
their schools. College boys hustled
toward the Hill. Business men
pressed the self-starters of their
streamline automobiles, and wives
sighed with relief, as husbands sped
toward offices.
Not so was this scene, 75 years
ago, for today is the 75th anniversary of the famous Battle of Fort
Sanders.
Union soldiers within the earthen
fort which stood near the present site
of Fort Sanders Manor, were breathlessly awaiting, just as they had
awaited throughout the long, unhappy night, the stealthy, silent approach, through the cold November
fog, of attacking Confederate soldiers led by General Longstreet.
And many of those attacking
Confederate soldiers had wives and
sweethearts and children in their
captured Knoxville homes, separated from them by Knoxville's occupation by Union soldiers, under
the command of General Burnside
of "burnside whiskers" fame!
Federal General Slain
Slowly, during the Confederate
siege of Knoxville, the aggressive
Confederate soldiers had driven the
retreating Union forces back up
Kingston Pike toward Knoxville, the
Union base.
The Union Brigadier General
William P. Sanders, a few days be-
for the Battle of Fort Sanders, had
been mortally wounded atop the hill
now occupied by the home of Mr.
and Mrs. Philip J. Briscoe, Jr., while
sitting astride his beautiful white
horse beside a green cedar tree. The
accurate aim of a Confederate
sharpshooter, hidden in a tree near
the site of the present residence of
Mr. and Mrs. Alex A. Bonnyman,
had sent this famous Kentucky General to his doom.
Through the freezing, misty
morning air of November 29th,
1863, exactly 75 years ago today,
the Confederate soldiers, at 4
o'clock on this Sunday morn, assaulted the western side of Fort
Sanders.
Ice was on the ground. Charging toward the Fort, the valiant
Confederates tripped and fell on
invisible wires which had been
strung by Union soldiers amid tree
stumps. Withering fire from Fort
Sanders mowed the fallen Confederates down.
Wildly cheering and with tattered Confederate banners flying,
the Confederates reached the base
of the Union breastworks, only to
fall forward and plunge into an invisible trench dug around the base
of Fort Sanders. The ice-glazed
earthen works made a Confederate
ascent of the Fort impossible.
Union soldiers stood within the
Fort and mowed down the entrapped Confederates with murderous
cross fire. Exploding hand grenades, lighted by Union soldiers from
their cigars, were tossed amid the
helpless, bleeding, screaming Confederates caught in the deadly
trench below the Fort. Blood in
the trench was over shoe-top deep.
The furious Battle of Fort Sanders lasted only 20 minutes.
392 Confederates Die
As the mists rose on this battle
scene, 75 years ago today, and the
sun came peeping over the eastern
mountains, the sun's rosy light fell
on the marble-white faces of 392
Confederate soldiers, who lay in
death on the bloody slopes of unconquerable Fort Sanders. They
would never see their beloved wives,
sweethearts and children again!
Within the not-to-be-captured
Fort Sanders, only eight Union soldiers lost their lives.</dc:description>
