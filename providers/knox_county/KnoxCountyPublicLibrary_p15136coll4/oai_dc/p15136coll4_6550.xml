<dc:description>Color postcard of New and Old City Hall, Columbia, S.C.  107-C.  Used. Postmark July 8, 1953.  2-cent stamp.  Description of building from the South Carolina Historical Society: Designed in 1870 by Alfred B. Mullett, supervising architect of the U.S. Treasury Department, the Renaissance Revival-style Columbia City Hall originally served as a federal courthouse and post office.  The Custom House in Knoxville was also designed by Alfred B. Mullet and served as a post office, custom office, pension office, and federal courtroom.  The two buildings are very similar in design.  The Knoxville building is currently the East Tennessee History Center and houses the McClung Historical Collection.  The postcard is filed under Postcard Collection&gt;South Carolina&gt;Columbia.</dc:description>
