Dear Sir:
The Legion Building Committee quit with a
debt of $32.00 owing us on the architectural commission, and it does seem to the writer that this
building represents about the maximum of architectural ability on our part and should be paid for in
full.    If you can collect it wish you would do so
but of course it is not big enough to make any fuss
o ver.   Parrott was Treasurer and knows it is due
because he has promised in months past to try and get
it for us.
Things are pretty tough for me. John is
working with the C.W.A. on a Geodetic Survey, but I
dont seem to fit in.  I found that General Jim
Cooper was riding the land owners up at Morris Lake
pretty hard on the payment of their property, so I
contracted fourteen of them, to appraise their buildings and lands, making surveys of both buildings and
land and putting it in shape to prove its reasonable
worth.  They have worried my clients a plenty, and
have practically broke up that business for me. I
had not learned that it was treason to the Government
to try and get an owner the fair value of his land
when it is being confiscated.
I have been hoping the addition to the
Edgemont school or something would come thro, but
suppose it has no chance.
See if you can lift that $32. for me, and
of course I will be glad to give you part depending on
the amount of effort you have to put out.
Yours very truly,  Fred Manley
