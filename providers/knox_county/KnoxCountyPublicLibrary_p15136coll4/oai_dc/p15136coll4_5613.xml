<dc:creator>Joe R. Haynes, Jr.</dc:creator>
<dc:description>"Hiking in the Mountains."  Volume I.  By Joe R. Haynes, Jr.  Volume 1 covers the years 1984-1995; Volume 2 includes 1996-2007.  An Index (scans 10-32) appears in Volume 1 and includes the hikes noted in both volumes.  Joe R. Haynes, Jr. was an attorney in Knoxville, Tennessee.  He and his wife Reba hiked together, sometimes with others, most often in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.  The hikes recorded in both volumes represent 8,500 miles of hiking.   Mr. Haynes died on May 20, 2009, at the age of 88.  Mrs. Haynes loaned the notebooks for copying in 2016; the originals were returned to her.</dc:description>
