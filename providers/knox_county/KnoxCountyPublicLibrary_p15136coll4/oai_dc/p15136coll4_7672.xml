<dc:creator>East Tennessee Land Company</dc:creator>
<dc:description>The East Tennessee Land Company was chartered May 25, 1889.  Property was purchased around what is now the town of Harriman (Tenn) with the plan to create a town based on prohibitionist principles and also utilize the natural resources of the area to develop subsidiary companies to attract industry. The initial land auction held in February 1890 was highly successful, but by November 1893 the East Tennessee Land Company was forced into bankruptcy.</dc:description>
