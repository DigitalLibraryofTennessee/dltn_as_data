  <abstract>Mr. and Mrs. Richard Keyhill. In 1857 Richard Keyhill (born ca. 1802) and other residents of South Knoxville formed a Sunday School in the Cedar Hill community of Knox County, TN. In December 1860 this group was organized as the Cedar Ridge Baptist Church. In the late 1860s it was renamed the Holston Baptist Church and in 1882 it was located on land donated by Perez Dickinson and was renamed Island Home Baptist church (or the Baptist Church at Island Home).</abstract>
