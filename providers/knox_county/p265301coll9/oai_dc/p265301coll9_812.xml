<dc:description>Here we have a part of the boat scene we have already
seen. Cedar Grove was used as a hospital for the
soldiers during the War Between the States, and when
we consider that they cooked in this room we wonder
that the walls were not blackened by smoke. If the
paper on the walls could have talked it could have told
us much that we would love to hear. Perhaps some
stories the soldiers told one another to while away
the  lonely hours  as   they longed for  home.
My uncle William Scott told one thing that happened in
this room. He said my grandmother believed in rearing
her children according to the Bible. When one of them
was guilty of some misdemeanor, she would take them in
the old parlor and talk seriously of the sin they had
committed, they would then get down on their knees and
she would pray for them and for herself - then she
would use the rod. My uncle said he never heard a word
of the serious talk or the prayer for he knew what was
to follow. However, he must have felt the affect of
it all and evidently the prayers of the good mother
were answered for he grew up to be a Christian lawyer,
and an elder   in the Presbyterian Church.
We are loathe to leave this old parlor with its associations, but here we are at the door we entered,
and we must pass out and close the door behind us and
leave  all  the sweet memories  of the past.</dc:description>
