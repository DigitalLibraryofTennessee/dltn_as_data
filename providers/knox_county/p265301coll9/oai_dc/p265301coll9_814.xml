<dc:description>Here is a picture of the mantel at Cedar Grove, which
Sister Ret took with her camera. My brother, John, who
was an architect was really an artist in many lines.
He admired this mantel very much and particularly
wanted its picture. I have tried to find a picture of
an open fireplace to go in it, but have not succeeded
yet - but I shall keep on trying. I think it was Mr.
Ledgerwood, when living in the house, plastered up the
fire place in this way. I wonder if the large room
could have possibily been heated with that very small
grate. When Dr. and Mrs. Ogle lived there they tore
this away and made an open fire place.</dc:description>
