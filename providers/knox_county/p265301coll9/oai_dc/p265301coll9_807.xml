<dc:description>Here in the extreme left of this picture, we see a
portion of a door. Let us open the door and enter the
old fashioned parlor of Cedar Grove - a very large room
with two windows to the south and two to the north,
and a large open fire place opposite the door we are
entering. As we turn to the left there is a beautiful
picture on the wall so it seems, but really it is wallpaper, brought from Paris before 1833. It did not come
in rolls as it does today, but in squares. Wall paper
was a rare luxury in America at the time Cedar Grove
was built. Little, if any, was manufactured in America,
or perhaps even in England. France seemed to have the
monopoly of its manufacture. Aside of its original
cost, the purchaser had to pay for its transportation
which was by slow sailing vessels taking months to
cross the ocean - then long overland or longer river
transportation - from New Orleans to Tennessee. The
paper is generally referred to as hand-painted, but it
is probably printed from hand engraved wood. Some of
the scenes are reproduced from the Gardens of Versailles.
At the time Cedar Grove was built there were only two
other houses in Tennessee with paper of this character.
One at the Hermitage in Nashville and the other in a
home in Rogersville, which later burned. Let us continue on around the room and see it all.</dc:description>
