<dc:description>At the height of the logging boom, over 200 miles of railroad snaked through the mountains.
Geared locomotives, such as the Shay engine, pulled heavy loads through the steep and winding
terrain. Portable steam-powered machines, such as the Clyde Overhead Skidder and the Surrey
Parker, made loading and moving large logs by rail much easier and safer. Large lumber mills and
company towns were built at Crestmont on Big Creek; Smokemont on the Oconoluftee River;
Ravensford on Raven Fork; Townsend on the Little River; and Proctor on Hazel Creek, among
others. The logging itself was done from portable camps, which moved from site to site as needed.
The books Dorie by Florence Cope Bush and Last Train to Elkmont by Vic Weals movingly document
what life was like in the lumber camps of the Little River. Logging continued on much of the
land acquired for the park. In 1939, the Little River Lumber Company hauled its last load of logs
from the mountains to its mill in Townsend. Over 60 percent of the Great Smoky Mountains
National Park had been logged by 1940, when the park was dedicated.</dc:description>
