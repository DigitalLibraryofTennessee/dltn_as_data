<dc:description>Photographs and captions from Miss Edith Scott's Memory Book, started July 1957.   Her ancestors included the Scott, Deaderick, Crozier, Ramsey, Anderson and Alexander families. Francis Alexander Ramsey Scott (1827-1909) married Margaretta Frances Deaderick (1833-1909) in 1857.  They were the parents of eleven children, including daughter Miss Edith Scott (1878-1971).

<dc:description>Two more views of Oak Hill - here we see the conservatory taken away and the green house built. The bay end
to the left of the house is the library and the bay
window to the right is the parlor and between them,
under the porch, is the sitting room. My father is
standing on the porch; my brother Frank is on horse
back; Clarence is stretched out on the ground; and my
brother John's dog, "Nig" is lying by him. Dan and
Charlie are the horses and Conley Fields is driving
the carriage.
In the small picture little Margaretta is coming to
welcome you, or perhaps she is watching Sister Ret take
the picture.
I do not know if our house was built on the exact plot
of land my father inherited when the property was divided among the heirs - for the other members of the
family when they wanted to sell their portion, would
come to him to buy from them, which he always did.
That made us "land poor" for a number of years. The
first property my father sold was a block between
Scott Street and Baxter Avenue, and he took the money
and built Oak Hill. Again, this house is no more. St.
Mary's Hospital is built all over our yard, which was
a little less than eight acres.</dc:description>
