<dc:description>Here is the same house we have seen, only remodeled.
Several rooms added to the back, upstairs and down, and
as you see, a tower added to the roof. Building a house
as room is needed, certainly makes a comfortable, convenient home. Living there we knew exactly what we
needed and built accordingly. The yard was just as
nice as the house. We had fruit trees and lovely shrubbery. Sister Lizzie had a green thumb - flowers were
her hobby. She had two pits full, and worked there
and in her flower beds every day the weather would
permit. My mother, too, was a great lover of flowers
and worked with them. We had a stable and kept a cow,
then we always had a turkey coop for we must have a
turkey every Sunday for dinner and other times too. My
brothers had an acting pole in the back yard, and what
good times we had with that! They would let me play
baseball with them, until the boys in the neighborhood
would come, then I knew I must get in the house.
In this picture we have all grown. Starting at the
left: first is Sister Ret, with her hat in her hand;
sitting down on the porch at her feet is John Barton;
standing next is Frederick William. Behind the post,
where you can just see her is Sister Lizzie; and seated
next to her is our dear cousin Mack Stewart, who used
to visit us frequently and was almost one of the family.
She and Sister Lizzie were special friends. Seated
next is Mamma; standing is my father; and at his feet
is Clarence (Clake we always called him). Next is
Annie; then I am standing with my oldest brother Jimmie,
who was not in the other picture. Standing at the gate
is Frank Ramsey; and seated in the buggy is David
Deaderick   (Buddy); and with him is Mary.
Our house was well located for it was directly opposite
the Deaf and Dumb Asylum, and it was just like having
a park in front of us. From the back we had a view of
"College Hill" - now the University of Tennessee. The
three old original buildings, as we saw them, silhouetted against the sky, have long since been taken
down, and so has 96 Asylum Street. Henley Street cut
off the back yard, and Wall Avenue cut down the house
itself.</dc:description>
