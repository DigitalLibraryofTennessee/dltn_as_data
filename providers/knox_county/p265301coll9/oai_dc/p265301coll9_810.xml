<dc:description>Now we are opposite the door where we entered the room
and we see the lovely mantel. This scene pictures
perhaps a picnic, where the musicians are entertaining
the crowd. I imagine the violinist with the high hat,
is playing a concerto - he rests his bow while the
flutist is playing the cadenza. The setting is just
the place to enjoy sweet music. When my sister Anne
was redecorating her apartment she conceived the idea
of buying this old mantel at Cedar Grove and placing
it at the chimney between two windows. We all became
quite excited over the idea and she wrote Dr. Ogle, who
was the owner at that time, and he agreed to sell if
she would put another mantel in its place. Her husband very wisely suggested that she measure the space
between the windows to see if the mantel would go in,
which it would not do. It measured eleven feet across
and is so high that I could not reach to get anything
from the top of it.</dc:description>
