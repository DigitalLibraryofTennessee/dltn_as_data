<dc:description>Sultana Survivors reunion.  Samuel Pickens (December 19, 1836-October 21, 1913) is pictured on the back row, 3rd from left, with his arm raised.   From http://www.tn.gov/tsla:  The worst maritime disaster in American history occurred on April 27, 1865, when the steamship Sultana exploded and burned on the Mississippi River while dangerously overloaded with passengers.  The ship's engineer discovered leaks in the boilers during a regular stop at Vicksburg on April 24 and hasty repairs were made.  Following the repairs, the Sultana proceeded to board 1,800 to 2,000 passengers, all repatriated Union prisoners desperate to get home from prison camps at Cahaba in Alabama and Andersonville in southwest Georgia.</dc:description>
