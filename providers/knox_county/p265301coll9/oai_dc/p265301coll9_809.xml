<dc:description>Here we have a love scene. The gentleman with his
hand on his heart is standing before the lady of his
choice pouring out his ardor and devotion. Years ago,
I remember just being able to decipher the name "Lillie "
written in pencil at the feet of the lady, and the
name "Will" written at the feet of the gentleman.
"Lillie" who was the daughter of W. B. A. Ramsey, aad
a niece of my grandmother visited at Cedar Grove:,
perhaps many times. "Will" was W. H. Simmons. Whoever
put those pencil marks, putting those two names together, I do not know. However, they seemed to sense
which way the wind would blow for later lillie and
Will became Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Simmons. The lovers in
the picture seem set apart, and quite oblivious to the
fact that some gentlemen and ladies are being most
cordially invited to enter into - perhaps a palace -
by a doorman or butler, or perhaps the host himself.
Are not these old scenes most fascinating!</dc:description>
