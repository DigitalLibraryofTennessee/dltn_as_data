<dc:title>Blue-Gray Reunion , 1890</dc:title>
<dc:description>Reunion of the Blue and the Gray in Knoxville, TN, October 8-9, 1890.  Allegedly the first joint meeting of the Civil War Union and Confederate veterans ever held.  The photograph was taken from the roof of the J.D. Cowan house near Cumberland Avenue, near the site of present day Sophronia Strong Hall on the University of Tennessee campus.  The tent seen at left was the "Monster Tent" which could seat 15,000.  It was erected near the edge of the remains of Fort Sanders, a Civil War site.</dc:description>
