<dc:description>We have to go back many, many years for the history of
this house, which we see only the front doorstep. My
great-grandfather, Captain John Crozier built it on
the North East corner of Gay Street and Clinch Avenue,
now the site of the Farragut Hotel.
I can remember when the hotel there was called the
Hattie House, and was built directly in the corner of
the lot, which made it almost in front of part of the
Crozier home. There was a brick walk running along the
North side of the hotel back to this door-step we see
in the picture. For years the Crozier house was part
of the hotel. I suppose it has been taken down when
the present hotel was enlarged. Anyway, for many years
the brick walkway has been a little narrow store - I
think always a shoe store.
My great-grandfather and his wife Hannah Barton Crozier
lived there sumptously and entertained lavishly. Here
pictured are their sons and daughters. Seated from
left to right: Mary Ann (Mrs. Frank Keller); Hannah
Wells (Mrs. William Swan); my grandmother, Elizabeth
Jane (Mrs. David Anderson Deaderick); Margaret Barton
(Mrs. J. G. M. Ramsey). Standing: John Harvey; Arthur
Ramsey;  Hugh Gilbreath;  Carrick  White.
Margaret Barton was twice my great-aunt, being the
sister of my grandmother Deaderick, and she was my
great aunt-in-law, as she was the wife of Dr. J. G. M.
Ramsey, who was the brother of my grandmother Scott.
The Crozier ladies were said to be noted for their
beauty and brains.</dc:description>
