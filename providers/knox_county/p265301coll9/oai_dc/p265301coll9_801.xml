<dc:description>This is a log house, later weatherboarded, built by my
grandfather, James Scott, Sr. on the site of a
filling station on the corner of Broadway and Lawson
Streets, Knoxville, Tennessee. He was born in Ireland,
and we first hear of him in Virginia, where he married
Janet Adams, daughter of John and Agnes Adams. They
moved to Washington County (then in North Carolina):,
then to Blount County, where their first years were
spent in a blockhouse, after which he built a log house
on his farm which consisted of 640 acres, but at one
time they were forced to return to the blockhouse,
because of an Indian raid. He, with other men, fired
through the portholes while Janet and other women
moulded bullets on the hearth. He was an intrepid
fighter, John Sevier called him his "right-hand man"
when fighting the Indians. I am pretty sure he fought
with John Sevier in the Battle of King's Mountain, but
have never been able to prove it. He and Janet were
members of the New Providence Presbyterian Church in
Blount County and moved their membership September 22,
1821 to the First Presbyterian Church of Knoxville,
Tennessee. James and Janet Adams Scott are buried in
the old graveyard of that church. They both were born
in the year 1760. He died August 30, 1823:, aged 63
years. Janet died August 10, 183 7, aged 77 years.
Ramsey's Annals tells of James Scott Sr. being a
representative from Blount County to the House of
Representatives, and also tells of his receiving a
letter from his brother-in-law, Samuel Handley (Henley).
They married sisters, Samue I Henley married Mary Adams,
and James Scott,   Sr.   married Janet Adams.
Janet (more often called Jane) Adams Scott, a sprightly
vivacious little soul with auburn hair, was born in
Virginia, but was of Irish ancestry. Her son, James
Scott, Jr. spoke of her as his "sweet little Irish
mother" and said she spoke with an Irish brogue. Her
experiences as a pioneer woman were ever vivid in her
mind, and when telling them, she would walk the floor,
dropping her knitting ball, her little grandson (my
father) would pick it up, trembling with fear and
excitement as she told her narrow escapes from the
Indians.
This picture was taken by "Sister Ret" who could draw
and paint as life-like pictures as the ones she took
with her  camera.
