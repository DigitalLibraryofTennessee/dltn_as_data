<dc:description>Here is my great grandfather, Captain John Crozier. He received his
title by being designated to represent chivalry and patriotism at the
funeral of General George Washington. "Conspicuous at the head of the
funeral cortege was the Company of Dragoons under the lead of Captain
John Crozier". He was ever known by that appelation.
His daughter, Elizabeth Jane Crozier Deaderick, writes in the Crozier
family Bible that her grandfather was born in France and was one of
the persecuted Huguenots who left their native country and settled in
Ireland. His father, John Crozier, and his mother, Jane Armstrong
Crozier, daughter of Rev. Gustavus Armstrong, were born, married and
died in Knockmaknowl, Fermanaugh County, Ireland, ages 98 and 97 years.
He was born May 12, 1769 and came to the United States at the age of
18. He lived with his maternal uncle, James Trooper Armstrong, in
Baltimore - later moved with his uncle and family to Abingdon, Virginia.
From there he came to Knoxville, Tennessee, became a partner in the
mercantile business with William King. After that dissolution he continued the business and became one of the most successful business men
in East Tennessee. His store on the South East corner of Market and
Fourth Streets (now Cumberland and Gay) was known as "Crozier's Corner". His son-in-law, Dr. J. G M. Ramsey, said in 1853, "It was
shaded by the ancient forest, and considered out of town, and for this
reason many predicted failure of the proprietor, but by his attention
to business, his courteous manner and integrity - he soon had one of
the most successful houses in town". In the store the Post Office had
a space, and he was postmaster for over 41 years.
In September 1798 he received his naturalization papers, and on January 3, 1799 he married Hannah Barton at the home of Major and Mrs.
Arthur Crozier - John Sevier and his family being present. He was a
devoted husband. He made frequent trips to Philadelphia, and at such
times he remembered his wife with lovely gifts - one time bringing her
a beautiful silver service. My mother inherited the sugar bowl, which
is pictured elsewhere in this book with two Chippendale chairs.
My great grandfather owned a large estate, several plantations, and
his home on the site where the Farragut Hotel now stands, was elegantly
furnished, where hospitality was dispensed to all.  General Andrew Jackson made it his headquarters when in Knoxville. You see in this
memory book a picture of the front door of this home - his sons standing and daughters seated on the steps. I wish so much I had a picture
of their mother, Hannah Barton Crozier, the daughter of Roger Barton,
a Revolutionary soldier, and Margaret Gilbreath Barton, who acted as a
scout in the Revolutionary War. Her grandfather, Thomas Barton, was
also a Revolutionary soldier. On another page in this memory book is
a picture of "Fruit Hill", the Crozier's country home. Turn back a
few pages and read about it.
Captain John Crozier was public spirited, and a most liberal contributor to every good enterprise. He was known as " the poor man's friend"
always protecting the poor from injustice and oppression, and gave
liberally and cheerfully to every good cause. When Blount College was
changed in 1807 to East Tennessee College, he was elected a trustee.
He was also a trustee in the Knoxville Female Academy. The education
of young women held his special interest. He was appointed one of
three commissioners to make contract and superintend the construction
of the First Presbyterian Church in 1812. It was completed in 1816
and at that time there was a debt on the church which was paid off by
the three commissioners. He was taken into the membership of the
church February 18, 1818, and was a faithful member to the end.
He died at "Fruit Hill" in the epidemic of fever in Knoxville on
October 12, 1838. He rests with his wife, Hannah Barton Crozier, in
the graveyard of the First Presbyterian Church.
My grandmother writes in the family Bible, "He suffered little pain
and died peacefully and calmly, relying fully in the merits and death
of our Saviour, for a glorious resurrection".
