<dc:description>Now this is the same scene we had over the mantel. I
shall ever be grateful that Mrs. Ogle had these pictures
taken when she and Dr. Ogle were living at Cedar Grove.
She said she wished the pictures could have been colored
but in that case, they could not have been copied, and
I would not have these lovely copies, which she most
graciously had made for me.
When the Baptist Church bought Cedar Grove from Dr.
and Mrs. Ogle, they seemed to appreciate the beauty
and historical value of the paper, but they sold it to
Mrs. Thomas Berry, who had it steamed off the walls,
and then gave it to the University. I wish I had known
when she had it taken off for I would have liked to
have bought this picnic scene, as there were two of
them. I would have covered it with glass and framed
it, and wouldn't it have been a sweet picture!</dc:description>
