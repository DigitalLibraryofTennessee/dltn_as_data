<dc:description>Here is "The Cottage":, three and half miles from Jones-
boro, Tennessee, where my mother Margaretta Frances
Deaderick  was born April 22, 1833.
The Deaderick home in Jonesboro was called Poplar Hill,
but my great-grandmother, Margaretta Anderson Deaderick
and her son (my grandfather) David Anderson Deaderick,
moved to The Cottage October 1828. My grandfather
Deaderick married my grandmother, Elizabeth Jane Crozier,
July 11, 1831, and brought her here as a bride. Their
first child was not born here but at Fruit Hill, Knoxville, Tennessee. The next and only one of their
children (my mother) was born in this little one-story
brick house.
They moved to Knoxville in 1834. When my grandmother
Deaderick's parents, John Crozier died September 12,
1838, and his wife Hannah Barton Crozier, died October
11, 1838, then it was that Grandfather and Grandmother
Deaderick moved to Fruit Hill, Knoxville. Many years
ago my sister Annie and her daughter, Margaretta, some
friends and I drove to Jonesboro just to find "The
Cottage" and Margaretta took this picture. It was then
owned by Susan Rogan, a descendant of Uncle Franklin
Deaderick's family. It was rented to strangers and we
saw only the wide hall running through the house, the
floor of wide planks, the doors were very wide with
lovely H hinges.
You didn't have to call on your imagination to see
that this house, though in bad repair, could have been
a sweet place to live. When the house was built some
time before 1828, it was considered an oddity on account
of its construction being rather uncommon. Here again
this home was torn down, I think to make way for the
new road from Jonesboro to Johnson City. I want to
make a trip to Jonesboro to see if I can find if there
is any place there that is still called Poplar Hill.
My grandfather Deaderick visited his brother Franklin
and family who were living at "The Cottage" in 1869,
and again spent Christmas week with them in 1870.</dc:description>
