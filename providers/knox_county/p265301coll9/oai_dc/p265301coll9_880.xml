<dc:description>Island Home, Perez Dickinson home and farm.  Part of the extensive formal gardens at "Island Home," the country estate of Col. Perez Dickinson.  This is the south side of the house, looking at the carriage entrance and bird house, and toward the fine smoke house which shows in the background.  The carriage house and smoke house were both on the same side of the house, which was on the river side.  The people are Cowans and Rheas which were all members of Col. Dickinson's family.  The little girl in sunbonnet, just to the left of the old workman, is Miss Bella Cowan who was later to marry Dr. Robert M. Rhea.  She was the mother of the owner of this picture (Mrs. Fayette Van Deventer).  Taken about 1887.  Caption by Mrs. Fayette Van Deventer.</dc:description>
