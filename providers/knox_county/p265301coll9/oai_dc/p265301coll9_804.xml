<dc:description>This is Cedar Grove, the house my grandfather, James
Scott, Jr. built in 1833. The walls are solid hand-
pressed brick, made on the place by his slaves. The
house is ell-shaped, two stories with eight rooms, four
below and four above. The chimneys are built in the
end walls, and the fire places were originally wide
enough to hold almost a chord of wood. In the kitchen
fire place were hooks on which hung kettles and spits.
The location of the house is ideal, in a grove of cedar
trees, on a high knoll on the west side of First Creek
and what is now Broadway. It is above a big bold
spring, and because of its accessibility is why this
house and the one across the road, were built. Finding
a good spring was usually what decided the early settlers for a location for their homes.
The place originally encompassed four hundred acres of
farm land, that is now Oakwood and Lincoln Park, extending to Sharp's Ridge, also to our home site, Oak
Hill, on the top of the hill above Cedar Grove, and
extending beyond what is now Scott Street. This view
of Cedar Grove would make a lovely painting. The picture was made after Dr. and Mrs. Ogle remodeled the
house. They put electricity and water and a furnace
in it, and added the stone terrace and the very beautiful doorway. There are many artistic touches in the
house - the mantels are hand carved, and the shallow,
broad steps, and beautifully wrought banisters of the
staircase show that my grandfather and grandmother
appreciated the fine and artistic. Though my grandfather
was successful in carrying on his father's milling
business and established the Scott Flour Mills, which
were in operation for over a hundred years, and was
prosperous in material things, we think of him best as
a good man. He was known as "the peacemaker" for he
was just that whenever any dispute arose between his
friends and neighbors. In an epidemic of cholera in
1838, he died September 14 of that year, while ministering to his friends and neighbors without any regard
to his own health.
His marriage to Eliza Ramsey was ideally happy. They
had only five years together, from 1833 to 1838 in this
lovely home at Cedar Grove. My grandmother was left
with five children, the youngest two years old and the
oldest eleven years old. She taught them to reverence
the memory of their father. Every Sunday she would
take them to the First Presbyterian Church, taking a
lunch and would stay for the second service, after
which she would take them to their father's grave in
the church graveyard, and tell them what a good, noble
man was their father.</dc:description>
