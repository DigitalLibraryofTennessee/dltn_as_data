LOW   COST   HOUSES.
A Book for Every Builder.
THE COTTAGE SOUVENIR,
No. 1.  Price 85 cents.                                                                                                                                                                             THIS Book, which has become so popular of late, has been revised and enlarged, and now contains over 30 Plates of Artistic Cottages, Residences,
Summer-houses, &amp;c, &amp;c, with plans and prices and brief hints to home builders.
The prices of these Cottages range from $500.00. and upward, mostly cheap
ones suited to the wants of the inquiring thousands who are searching for cheap
but Artistic Cottages every day, and every class of persons can be supplied
from this collection of plans.
Although any shrude (sic.) builder can build direct from the plans as given in the
book. I have arranged so that any builder ordering a set of working plans of
any house in this book, will be allowed a commission of 10 per cent from the
prices given for the working plans.
THE BOOK
has 56 pages, 5x7 in., printed on heavy gloss paper, bound in handsome paper
cover, and will be sent to any address for 85 Cents in postal note, being less than
3 cent for each plate.
M. Montgomery &amp; Co., Builders, of Holton, Kansas, say: " It is the best collection of houses we have ever seen."
Builder and Wood Worker of New York says:   "Many of the designs are
handsome and meritorious."
Many others might be given.
Order a book at once and be convinced of its merits.     Send 50 Ccents (sic.) for
blank specification and contract forms complete for one building.
Address,
GEO, F. BARBER, Architect,
KNOXVILLE, TENN.
Late of DeKalb, III.</dc:description>
