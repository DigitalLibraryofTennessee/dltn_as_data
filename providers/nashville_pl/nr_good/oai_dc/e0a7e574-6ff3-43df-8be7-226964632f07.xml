<dc:title>Major John J. McCann, between 1888 and 1907</dc:title>
<dc:description>A portrait photograph of Major John J. McCann, a Confederate Army veteran of the American Civil War, who became a prominent merchant miller based in Nashville, Tennessee during the post-war era. McCann, a Democrat, was born in Davidson County, Tennessee in 1835 and was a councilman from 1881-84 and served on the board of Education from circa 1869 to 1871, a state Senate representative in 1883, and was an executive officer of the Tennessee Centennial board in 1896. McCann was also a County Trustee for several years until his death in 1907. The John J. McCann School was named for him, in recognition of his generous services to the teachers of the county. Circa 1930, the Mayor and City Council of Nashville passed an ordinance wherein Petway Street, also known as Hill's Alley, a narrow thoroughfare connecting Second Avenue, South, and Fourth Avenue, South, was widened and renamed McCann Street in his honor. Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 mounted photograph : sepia ; 5 x 7 in.</dc:description>
