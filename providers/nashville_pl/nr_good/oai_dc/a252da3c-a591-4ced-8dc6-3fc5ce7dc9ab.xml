<dc:title>Ross Elementary School in East Nashville, circa  1925</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of the Ross Elementary School, located at 1300 Ordway Place (formerly Grove Avenue) in East Nashville, Tennessee. The notation reads: "Anne Hester entered in First Grade and finished 9th Grade, going then to Hume-Fogg where she graduated in 1933." The Ross Elementary School was erected in 1907 and named for Marcus M. Ross who worked as a teacher and principal for Nashville city schools. In 1933, a tornado that swept through East Nashville damaged the school building. The structure closed in 1988, and a new building was constructed on McFerrin Avenue at the site of the old East High School football field. Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph, mounted : sepia ; 3.5 x 5 in. (page: 6.75 x 10.75 in.)</dc:description>
