<dc:title>Pupils and faculty from the Fanning Orphan School, Nashville, Tennessee, circa 1894 June</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of pupils and faculty from the Fanning Orphan School, popularly known as Fanning College. The school was chartered in 1881 and opened in 1884. This non-extant school was located about five miles from downtown Nashville, Tennessee, on Couchville Pike (in the present area of the Nashville International Airport). By 1905, the school had educated more than 200 girls, including some female pupils who were not orphans. The enrollment was around 80 in 1905 and the school continued until circa 1943, when the City of Nashville acquired the property for the extension of the Nashville Municipal Airport. The Fanning Orphan School was founded by Charlotte Fall Fanning, the sister of Phillip S. Fall, and the second wife of Tolbert Fanning. The married couple established a series of educational institutions on the site as early as 1840. Both schools were associated with what is now the Church of Christ and included religious education in the curriculum. Perhaps the best known was the Franklin College for young men, but its building burned in 1865 soon after classes resumed after the Civil War. Mrs. Fanning formerly taught at the Nashville Female Academy (she was born near London, England, on April 10, 1809) and Mr. Fanning (1810-1874) graduated from the University of Nashville in 1835. Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph : sepia ; 8 x 10 in.</dc:description>
