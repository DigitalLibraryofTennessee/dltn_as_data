<dc:title>James Geddes Engine Company No. 6, between 1968 and 1987</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of the James Geddes Engine Company No. 6, a two-story architectural structure located at 629 2nd Avenue, South, in Nashville, Tennessee. This building's address at the time of the photograph was 627 2nd Avenue, South, as listed in the Nashville City Directory. Originally built in the late 19th century circa 1885, this former Fire Hall was named for James Geddes, a civil engineer with the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. The construction system is red brick, stone, and metal. The building has been listed in the National Register of Historic Places since January 9, 1978 and features a Victorian architectural design with some characteristics of Dutch Renaissance style. Centered at front are the large wooden doors that originally swung outward for the horse-drawn fire equipment. There used to be a bell tower and steeple on the top right, but it was destroyed in a storm and never rebuilt. Photographed by the Nashville architect Charles Wesley Warterfield, Jr. (1926-1998); the architectural photograph forms part of the Charles Warterfield Architectural Collection. Gift of:  The Estate of Charles W. Warterfield, Jr., F. A. I. A.  The original is a 35 mm color transparency (2 x 2 in. slide mount)</dc:description>
