<dc:title>The Ryman Auditorium, 1977 June</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of the Ryman Auditorium located at 116 5th Avenue North, Nashville, Tennessee. Built as the Union Gospel Tabernacle in 1892, the structure was designed by architect Hugh Thompson for worship, but is perhaps best-known as the one-time house for the Grand Ole Opry.  It was used for Grand Ole Opry broadcasts from 1943 until 1974, when the Opry built a larger venue just outside Nashville at the Opryland USA theme park.  The Ryman then sat mostly unused until 1994 when it reopened as both a performance venue and a museum after undergoing extensive restorations.  In 2001, the Ryman Auditorium was designated as a National Historic Landmark and included in the National Register of Historic Places.  Forms part of the Nashville Banner Archives. 1 photograph : b &amp; w ; 8 x 10 in.</dc:description>
