<dc:title>High-rise view of the Downtown Presbyterian Church and the Cohen Building, Nashville, Tennessee, 2012 May </dc:title>
<dc:description>A high-rise view of two historic architectural structures in downtown Nashville: 1) the Downtown Presbyterian Church, designed by architect William Strickland in the Egyptian Revival architectural style, located on the corner of 5th Ave and Church Street, and 2) the Cohen Building, a commercial property at 421 Church Street.  The Cohen Building, designed in the Italian Renaissance style, was erected in 1890, as the townhouse and business property of Meyer and George Etta Cohen.  The couple owned a successful jewelry shop on the first floor and resided on the top two levels of their lavish townhouse.  The Cohen Building has been renovated and restored in recent years.  Forms part of the Leanne Garland Photograph Collection.  1 digital photograph.  </dc:description>
