<dc:title>Nashville Thermal Transfer Plant, Nashville, Tennessee, circa 1974</dc:title>
<dc:description>A construction site sign at the Nashville Thermal Transfer Corporation Plant, circa 1974.  The plant was located on a ten acre site between First Avenue South and the Cumberland River in downtown Nashville, Tennessee.  Construction began July, 1972, after the Nashville Thermal Transfer Corporation was established as a private, non-profit corporation.  The plant was conceived during the administration of Nashville Mayor Beverly Briley, was designed by I. C. Thomasson &amp; Associates and constructed by Foster &amp; Creighton.  The Thermal plant began operation in mid-1974 and was the first to combine the technologies of steam and chilled water production from the incineration of solid wastes.  In 2002, the plant was destroyed by a fire. The Foster &amp; Creighton construction contracting firm was founded in 1885 by Wilbur F. Foster and Robert T. Creighton, who had both served as City Engineer of Nashville.  Forms part of the Foster &amp; Creighton General Contractors Collection. 1 b&amp;w photograph.  </dc:description>
