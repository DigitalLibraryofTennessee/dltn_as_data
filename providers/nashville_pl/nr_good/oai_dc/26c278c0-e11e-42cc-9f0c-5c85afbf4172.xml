<dc:title>Sixty-first Avenue United Methodist Church, 2001 May</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of Sixty-first Avenue United Methodist Church located at 6018 New York Avenue in Nashville, Tennessee.  The church's original site address was 6020 New York Avenue.  The foundation is made of concrete blocks, painted white.  The exterior walls are a combination of concrete block and wood siding, both painted white.  The roof is composed of tar shingles and is gabled.  The windows are colored glass.  The doors are both metal and wood.  The church has a metal steeple.  At the rear of the church there is a section that sits at a different angle than the rest of the building.  This section appears to be newer than the main building and has a gabled roof and metal doors with an awning above them.  There is also a concrete block structure to the right of the main entrance.  This structure may not have been built at the same time as the church.  This structure has a gabled roof with tar shingles and wood siding on the upper parts.  The windows are clear glass and the doors are also metal.  Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4  x 6  in.</dc:description>
