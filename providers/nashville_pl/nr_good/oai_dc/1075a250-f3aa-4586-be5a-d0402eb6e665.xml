<dc:title>Original wills, Falk, Herman Daniel 1881</dc:title>
<dc:description>An original will of Herman Daniel Falk, dated July 12th, 1881. Illustrates the full document. Falk&#8217;s beneficiaries include his father Michael Falk, sister, and his two nieces, Selma and Blanche. Falk states &#8220;[his] desire that the Mining Stock&#8230;shall not be disposed of until the death of [his] father and the consent of [his] nieces&#8230;obtained as this stock is paying a handsome dividend and becoming more valuable.&#8221; Falk further requests that a specific lot &#8220;also be held for some years&#8221; for the same reason. Falk appoints as executor his friend T.D. Flippin.  Falk died in Alleghany Springs, Montgomery County, Virginia; his will was presented for probate in the Montgomery County Court on August 23rd, 1881. Per the State of Tennessee&#8217;s Wills and Inventories Book #26, the September Term Court in Davidson County found &#8220;to [its] satisfaction&#8230;that the foregoing instrument is duly authenticated.&#8221;  Forms part of Record Group 16, Original Wills, 1780-1925. </dc:description>
