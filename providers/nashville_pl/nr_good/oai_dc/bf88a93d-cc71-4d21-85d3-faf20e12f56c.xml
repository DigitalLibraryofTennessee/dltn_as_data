<dc:title>Letter from P.J. Williamson to his wife, Eunice, during the Civil War, 1864 October 26</dc:title>
<dc:description>A letter from Dutch immigrant, Peter J. Williamson, back home to his wife, Eunice, during the Civil War.  In 1862 Williamson enlisted as a Private in the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, Company F and was ultimately promoted to Full 1st Lieutenant.  During the war, Williamson's regiment was involved in scouting and raids in Missouri and Arkansas and saw battle in the Middle Tennessee, Chickamauga, and Atlanta campaigns. In this letter from Nashville, Tennessee, Williamson tells Eunice he is returning the next day to his command in Calhoun, Georgia.  He complains of not receiving a letter from her in 5 weeks due to his absence from his brigade.  He states that he has enjoyed his assignment except for financial considerations and mentions that his time is nearly up although efforts were being made to persuade him to reenlist.  He briefly discusses reasons for not doing so including the chance of further injury in combat and the reduction of income due to the income tax.  Williamson closes by mentioning the possibility of being home in a month and his relief that she did not come to visit due to enemy actions on the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad.  Forms part of the Peter J. Williamson Letters. 1 letter : col. ; 5  x 8  in.</dc:description>
