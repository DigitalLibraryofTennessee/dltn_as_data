<dc:title>Oral history interview with Judge Alfred Thompson Adams, 1980 September 16, excerpt 02</dc:title>
<dc:description>An excerpt from an oral history interview with Nashville lawyer and judge Alfred Thompson Adams, conducted on 16 September 1980 by Leanne Thornton as part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. 1910-1935 Oral History Project.  Adams, who served Nashville as Chancellor of Part Two of the Davidson County Chancery Court from 1957 to 1970, discusses a bet he made with his brother in 1910.  His brother bet him half of the pigeons they owned together that he would not run from their house at 1603 Broad Street (now Broadway Avenue) to Vanderbilt and back in his night clothes.  Alfred won the bet.  The complete interview is available in the repository.</dc:description>
