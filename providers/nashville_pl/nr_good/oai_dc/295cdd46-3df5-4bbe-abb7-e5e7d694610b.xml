<dc:title>Portrait of Mr. Gregg, ca. between 1840 and 1870</dc:title>
<dc:description>Mr. Gregg, middle-aged, with grey hair and full grey beard. His clothing is dark and he may be seated.  Mr. and Mrs. Gregg came to Nashville, Tennessee, from Scotland and opened Gregg's Bakery, later Mitchell's, which operated for over a century in the original location on Union Street.  Mr. Gregg is probably George Greig, a baker and confectioner born in Scotland and operating his business on Union Street in Nashville during the 1850s and 1860s.  He may have been in America as early as 1830 and probably first lived in New York before coming to Tennessee around 1850, as the 1860 census lists his children as born in New York.  He died after 1860 and before 26 Nov. 1867, the date his body was moved from his grave in the Nashville City Cemetery to one in Mt. Olivet Cemetery.  Oil on canvas.  Donated to the library by Mrs. J. Francis McCloud, granddaughter of the Greggs.  The portrait is currently not on display.  

The library's portraits were photographed as part of the National Society of The Colonial Dames of America in Tennessee's Tennessee Portrait Project (http://www.tnportraits.org/index.htm).  </dc:description>
