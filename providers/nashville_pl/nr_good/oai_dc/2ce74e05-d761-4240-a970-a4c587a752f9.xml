<dc:title>Berry Elementary School, Nashville, Tennessee, n.d. </dc:title>
<dc:description>An exterior view of the Berry Elementary School, located at 2200 Winford Avenue, in Nashville, Tennessee.  In 1938 Berry School replaced the old J.K. Rains School that dated back to 1910.  In that year, on the assurance that the County Board of Education would construct a building if the land were provided, the citizens of the community purchased a portion of the land granted to John Rains, one of the first settlers of Nashville.  It opened with 60 pupils and 2 teachers.  Originally designed for elementary grades, it became, in time, an eight-grade school with the additions necessary to accommodate an expanding enrolment.  In 1938 the Board of Education recognized the inadequacy of the old wooden building and replaced it with a two-story, ten-classroom, brick structure wan an auditorium and lunch room.  At that time the name was changed from J. K. Rains to Berry School, honoring thereby William Tyler Berry, an insurance partner of John Early.  In 1947 lightning struck the school and the building burned.  During the construction of a new building, Berry School classes were housed in the old Classification Center on Thompson Lane.  On November 1, 1949, the second Berry School opened.  Two new classrooms were added in 1954-55.  Forms part of the Metro Archives Photographs - School Collection. 1 photograph.   </dc:description>
