<dc:title>Construction of the City Market House, Nashville, Tennessee, circa 1937 </dc:title>
<dc:description>A view of roof work construction (dome) at the City Market Building, a municipal market house and private garage for the automobiles of city officials.  This structure was built on the north side of the Public Square in downtown Nashville.  The completed new structure was designed by architect Henry C. Hibbs, with the construction contract awarded to Foster and Creighton General Contractors.  This structure is built of brick on a concrete frame, with its pitched roof of copper with a dome extending up from a flat roof around the edge of the building.  In later years, the building was enlarged and became the Ben West Municipal Building.
