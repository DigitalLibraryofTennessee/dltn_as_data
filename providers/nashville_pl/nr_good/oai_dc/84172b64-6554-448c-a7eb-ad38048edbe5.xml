<dc:title>Photograph of Rebecca Landers in Women's Army Auxiliary Corps uniform,  1943 May 26</dc:title>
<dc:description>A studio portrait of Rebecca Landers in Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) uniform, 26 May 1943. An inscription on the front of the photograph to her husband, Corris, reads: "Everlastingly your wife, Rebecca." A few months after this photograph was taken, the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps would become the Women's Army Corps (WAC), reflecting their change in status from a civilian auxiliary to members of the military. Rebecca (Bonham) Landers Jennings was born in Alabama, attended Tuskegee University, met and married her first husband, Corris, and joined the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (later the Women's Army Corps) after her husband joined the army and was sent to Europe during World War II. After the war and their discharge from the armed forces, she and her husband used the GI Bill to attend Tennessee State University and Fisk University, where she obtained her bachelor's and master's degrees. She was widowed and remarried, and went on to pursue a career in education with the Nashville Public Schools where she taught for over 30 years. Forms part of the Veterans History Project. 1 digital print.</dc:description>
