<dc:title>Cheekwood Botanical Gardens and Museum of Art, Nashville, Tennessee, circa 1990s   </dc:title>
<dc:description>Architecture and landscape views of the Cheekwood Botanical Gardens and Museum of Art, located on the western edge of Nashville, Tennessee at 1200 Forrest Park Drive.  The history of Cheekwood originated with the Cheek family, one of Nashville&#8217;s early entrepreneurial families.  The Cheekwood mansion was built in 1932 in the Colonial Revival style for Leslie and Mabel Cheek.  Designed by New York residential and landscape architect, Bryan Fleming, wherein the magnificent limestone mansion and extensive formal gardens were inspired by the grand English houses of the 18th century.  In 1943, Mabel Cheek deeded the house to her daughter, Huldah Cheek Sharp, and her husband, Walter Sharp. The Sharps lived at Cheekwood until the 1950s when they offered it as a site for a botanical garden and art museum.  The development of the property was spearheaded by the Exchange Club of Nashville, the Horticultural Society of Middle Tennessee and many other civic groups. The Nashville Museum of Art donated its permanent collections and proceeds from the sale of its building to the effort.  The new Cheekwood opened to the public on May 22, 1960 with a dedication given by Senator Albert Gore, Sr.  Forms part of the Paul Bates Collection - Travel Guide West End.  Photographs, color.   </dc:description>
