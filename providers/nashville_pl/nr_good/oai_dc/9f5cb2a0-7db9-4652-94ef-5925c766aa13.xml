<dc:title>Pot luck, between 1960 and 1969</dc:title>
<dc:description>An original political cartoon drawing created by Jack Knox, the Nashville Banner editorial cartoonist from the mid-1940s to early 1970s.  This cartoon depicts the issue of Daylight Saving Time, related to Nashville in the 1960s.  Nationally, some of the states had Daylight Saving Time and others did not, likewise for some countries.  Nashville was unique in that some people were on VDST (Voluntary Daylight Saving Time, promoted by the Nashville Tennessean) and others stuck to Central Standard Time (favored by the Nashville Banner).  This particular cartoon depicts a cuckoo clock ("Voluntary fast time confusion") holding a cauldron labeled "Nashville time," chock- full of watches and clocks all reading different times.  Forms part of the Jack Knox Political Cartoon Collection. 1 original cartoon drawing : b &amp; w ; 16.25 x 24 in.</dc:description>
