<dc:title>Building the City Reservoir in Nashville, Tennessee, 1887</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of the Nashville City Reservoir, in Nashville, Tennessee, as it was being constructed in 1877. An accompanying article describes the completed structure, as quoted: "The City Reservoir, which was built in 1887, cost the city of Nashville $364,526.21. The structure is elliptical in shape, and major axis is 603 feet, while the minor axis is 466 4-10 feet. The distance around the reservoir at the top of the wall is about one-third of a mile. The capacity of the big water basin is 51,000,000 gallons. The reservoir is divided into two compartments by a partition wall. The outside wall is 9 feet wide at the top and 23 feet wide at the bottom. The basin of the structure is 277 feet above low water mark in the river. It took two years to complete the reservoir. Ground was broken Aug. 28, 1887 and the work was completed Aug. 24, 1889. The maximum force engaged on the job was 750 men and 50 teams. At one time there was in use 22 derricks, 11 steam hoisting engines and 3 steam drills. The material used in building the reservoir was taken out of the hill where the structure is located. The excavation alone cost $121,744.28. The main wall is divided into two sections by a core of concrete and the cost of this material was $56,407.36. The idea of the concrete core was to prevent leaking. Including the concrete, the whole structure consists of 45,928 cubic yards of masonry. When the reservoir was built the late Pink McCarver was Mayor, and the Board of Public Works was composed of Messrs. Ewing, Nestor and Kercheval. J. A. Jowett was the City Engineer." The reservoir is located on Eighth Avenue South. The historic structure, located at 1401 8th Avenue South, was built on top of Kirkpatrick Hill on the site of Fort Casino just south of downtown Nashville. Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 mounted photograph : sepia ; 8 x 10 in.</dc:description>
