<dc:title>Letter from P.J. Williamson to his wife, Eunice during the Civil War, 1862 March 05</dc:title>
<dc:description>A letter from Dutch immigrant Peter J. Williamson back home to his wife, Eunice, during the Civil War.  In 1862 Williamson enlisted as a Private in the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, Company F and was ultimately promoted to Full 1st Lieutenant.  During the war, Williamson's regiment was involved in scouting and raids in Missouri and Arkansas and saw battle in the Middle Tennessee, Chickamauga, and Atlanta campaigns. In this letter from Kenosha, Wisconsin, Williamson inquires about the state of his wife's health and encourages her to seek proper medical attention.  He discusses a bill that passed in Congress to reduce the cavalry force from seventy-seven Regiments down to fifty.  He explains how that would mean one of the three Regiments from the state of Wisconsin would be disbanding.  He mentions that he named his horse Willy, after their son, William.  He briefly touches on money concerns and finishes by asking Eunice to write often.  On the last page he includes a note for his father written in Dutch.  Forms part of the Peter J. Williamson Letters. 1 letter : col. ; 7.5  x4.5  in.</dc:description>
