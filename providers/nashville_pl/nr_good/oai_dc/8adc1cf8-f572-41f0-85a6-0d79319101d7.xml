<dc:title>Historic home residence Oak Hill, Nashville, Tennessee, 1911</dc:title>
<dc:description>The Oak Hill &#8220;residence of Mr. and Mrs. Van Leer Kirkman, like many other homes on the Franklin Pike, is situated on a portion of the battle field of Nashville. Many relics of this conflict are here preserved. On the lovely lawn, immediately in front of the house, is a cannon which was used in this great battle &#8230;. Nothing has more distinguished this home than its gracious hospitality. This was especially notable during the Tennessee Centennial Exposition, when, as President of the Woman&#8217;s Board, Mrs. Kirkman gave weekly receptions at which many people of distinction were entertained.&#8221; This 19th century residence was located approximately seven miles south of Nashville on Franklin Pike. Today the First Presbyterian Church occupies the site at the corner of Franklin Pike and Tyne Boulevard.

Caldwell and published in 1911. 1 digital photo, title supplied by cataloger.</dc:description>
