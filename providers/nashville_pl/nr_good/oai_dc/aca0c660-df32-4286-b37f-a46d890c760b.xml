<dc:title>St. Timothy Missionary Baptist Church, 2001 March</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of St. Timothy Missionary Baptist Church located at 2830 Clifton Avenue in Nashville, Tennessee.  The building's shallow foundation is slab-on-grade.  The exterior walls are made of cinder block.  The roof is made of shingles.  There are no proper windows.  Where windows would be, mesh wire covers the exterior, while the interior is lined with sheet rock.  The doors are solid plywood.  The survey indicates that this church was once used by the Braden Tabernacle congregation.  Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4  x 6  in.</dc:description>
