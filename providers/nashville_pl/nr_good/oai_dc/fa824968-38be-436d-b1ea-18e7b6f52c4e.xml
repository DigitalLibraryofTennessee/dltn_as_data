<dc:title>Printer's Alley in Nashville, Tennessee, circa 1973 September</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of Printer's Alley, located between Church and Union Streets and Third and Fourth Avenues, in Nashville, Tennessee, as it appeared circa September 1973. Pictured are some of the popular nightlife places in the alley: The Brass Rail Stables, Hugh X. Lewis Country Club, The Embers, and Carousel Club. Printer's Alley is named for Nashville's publishing and printing industry that started in this immediate area before the turn of the twentieth century. During the 1920s' Prohibition, there were several speakeasies in the alley. During the 1940s, nightclubs opened in the alley when the entertainment district was a showcase for the talents of performers such as Boots Randolph, Chet Atkins, Waylon Jennings, Dottie West, Hank Williams, Barbara Mandrell, and Jimi Hendrix. Printer's Alley continues to be a popular entertainment destination for both locals and tourists. Printer's Alley is a National Register Historic District. Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph : b &amp; w ; 5 x 7 in.</dc:description>
