<dc:title>Belmont College and grounds, Nashville, Tenn., circa 1910</dc:title>
<dc:description>A postcard of Belmont College, a collegiate and preparatory school for young ladies located in Nashville, Tennessee.  This school for girls was opened in 1890 in the West End neighborhood, at the intersection of Broad and Vauxhall Streets.  Some subjects taught at Belmont included Music and Art, Physical Training, Literary and Scientific Advantages, and Religious Instruction.  Belmont was built by leading members of the Methodist Church and so was affiliated with that denomination.  In 1913, Belmont merged with rival school Ward Seminary and formed Ward-Belmont College.  In 1951 Ward-Belmont College was purchased by the Tennessee Baptist Convention and renamed Belmont College.  Forms part of the Nashville Room Postcard Collection. 1 postcard : col. ; 3.5  x 5.5  in.</dc:description>
