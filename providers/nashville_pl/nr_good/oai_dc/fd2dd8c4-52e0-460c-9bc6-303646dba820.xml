<dc:title>Furman Hall - Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tenn., circa 1930</dc:title>
<dc:description>A postcard of Furman Hall on the campus of Vanderbilt University.  When Furman Hall opened in 1907, it was called the most modern chemistry/pharmacy building in the United States. Its name honors Francis Furman, a Nashville merchant, whose widow provided the building funds. Furman's grey stone composition creates a sharp contrast to the surrounding brick buildings.  Originally the home of the science and engineering departments, Furman was remodeled to house the humanities in 1967. Today, Furman Hall houses foreign languages, classical studies, philosophy, and the Women's Studies Program.  Forms part of the Nashville Room Postcard Collection. 1 postcard : col. ; 3.5  x 5.5  in.</dc:description>
