<dc:title>Church of God, 2001 December</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of the former Church of God located at 1003 Monroe Street in Nashville, Tennessee.  In the 1960s the name changed to Church of the Lord Jesus Christ of the Apostolic Faith.  In the 1980s Nashville city directories note the address as vacant, and in the 1990s and onward the address is unlisted.  At the time of the survey in 2001 the building had been condemned and there was a notice on the front entryway announcing the building unfit for occupation or use.  A "For Sale By Owner" sign was hung on the front exterior wall.  The foundation was concrete block.  The exterior walls were concrete block.  The roof was asphalt.  The windows were boarded up with plywood.  The doors were made of wood.  Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4  x 6  in.</dc:description>
