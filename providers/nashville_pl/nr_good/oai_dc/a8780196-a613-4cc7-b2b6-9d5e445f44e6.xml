<dc:title>Exterior view of Christ Church Cathedral, Nashville, Tennessee, circa 1940s</dc:title>
<dc:description>An exterior view of Christ Church Cathedral, located at 900 Broadway Avenue, in downtown Nashville.  Christ Church Cathedral serves as the Cathedral for the Episcopal Diocese of Tennessee.  Originally built in 1830 on the corner of Sixth Avenue and Church Street, Christ Church.  In 1890, a new lot was purchased for construction of a new worship facility on Broad and McLemore (Ninth Avenue).  The present structure was completed in 1894.  This Victorian Gothic architecture was designed by Francis Hatch Kimball of New York.  It was constructed of Sewanee sandstone, a gift from the University of the South.  Bowling Green grey stone was used in the trim, the gargoyles and later in the tower.  The gabled and hipped roof is comprised of slate shingles and has a very complex structure.  A mix of Gothic arched and circular shaped, stained glass windows with finished stone blocks surrounding the glass are frequently placed amongst the walls.  Forms part of Record Group 412, Photographs Collection. 1 photograph negative : b &amp; w ; 4 x 5 in.</dc:description>
