<dc:title>Excerpt from press conferences with former Nashville Mayor Beverly Briley, c. 1970</dc:title>
<dc:description>An excerpt from a press conference with former Nashville Mayor Beverly Briley conducted in 1970.  Mayor Briley discusses upcoming trip to Washington where he will testify regarding intergovernmental relations and public improvements.  Specifically, he addresses the weak provisions of the Interstate Road Program for relocating the residences and businesses associated with the "I-40 situation."  Other topics include equal employment opportunity, crime prevention, and the investigation of a book burning incident.  The record also contains audio from two budget committee meetings. Audio record is of poor quality, therefore the speech is slurred.  The complete record is available at the Metro Government Archives.</dc:description>
