<dc:title>Excerpt 3 from oral history interview with Andromedia "Andy" Bagwell Noel, 2004 November 01</dc:title>
<dc:description>An excerpt from an oral history interview with Andromedia "Andy" Bagwell Noel, conducted on 1 November 2004 by Betty Richards as part of the Nashville Public Library's Veterans History Project.  Noel served  from 1943 until 1946 as a Gray Lady at Thayer Veterans Hospital on White Bridge Road  in Nashville, Tennessee.  In this excerpt, Noel discusses her duties as a Gray Lady.  The Gray Ladies were a volunteer organization founded by the American National Red Cross (later American Red Cross) in 1918 to provide non-medical assistance to military hospitals.  This was later expanded to include all hospitals. The complete interview, as well as an index, is available in the repository.</dc:description>
