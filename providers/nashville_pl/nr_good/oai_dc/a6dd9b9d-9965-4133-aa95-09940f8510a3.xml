<dc:title>Al Jolson, singing comedian stops off here, 1941 March 14</dc:title>
<dc:description>Al Jolson, famous singing comedian of the stage and screen, stopped in Nashville &#8220;yesterday evening en route by plane to the West Coast for a surprise visit to his son, who celebrates his sixth birthday today.  He is shown at the Hermitage Hotel with petite Elizabeth Smith, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. George Smith, formerly of Louisville, Ky., but now of Columbia, Tenn., who was a guest at the hotel.  She and Jolson formed a mutual admiration society in short order, and both appear to be having quiet a time.  Jolson said he was coming back to Nashville soon with his show &#8216;Hold Your Hats,&#8217; in which he and Martha Raye take the leading roles.&#8221;--photo negative sleeve, with the date of March 14, 1941.  Forms part of Record Group 412, Photographs Collection. 1 photograph negative : b &amp; w ; 4 x 5 in.</dc:description>
