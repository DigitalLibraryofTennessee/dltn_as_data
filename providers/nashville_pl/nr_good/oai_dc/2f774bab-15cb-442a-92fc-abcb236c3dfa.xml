<dc:description>A photograph showing the circulation desk and staff of the Nashville Public Library, assisting the community patrons, circa 1955. Originally established as the Carnegie Library of Nashville, the building was located at 8th Avenue North and Union Street in Nashville, Tennessee. Pictured in the photograph are Dr. Robert S. Alvarez, Director, Peggy Benson, Mary Stone, and Lillias Burns.
