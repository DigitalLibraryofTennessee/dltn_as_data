<dc:title>Downtown Presbyterian Church, Nashville, Tennessee, n.d.</dc:title>
<dc:description>A postcard of the Downtown Presbyterian Church, located on the corner of Fifth Avenue N and Church Street in downtown Nashville, Tennessee.  154 5th Avenue North in downtown Nashville, Tennessee.  When the building was first erected in 1849 the streets were called Summer Street and Spring Street, and the structure briefly held the title as the largest building in the city.  Then church member Adelicia Acklen of the Belmont Mansion donated the two-ton church bell that, for a time, was used as the city fire alarm.  The pre-war portion of the building was designed by William Strickland, who was also the architect for the Tennessee State Capitol.  This church is the third one to stand on the site, the first two being destroyed by fire.  The front columns were added in 1871.  The church school building, finished in 1919, had an Akron-plan assembly hall, which was redesigned in 1962 as a Romanesque chapel with a four-story dome.  The front fa&#231;ade was added and the walls were painted in 1882.  The stained glass windows were installed in 1887.  Renowned for its Egyptian design, the interior was intended to resemble the temple to Amon-Ra, at Karnak on the upper Nile.  The two towers are said to be modeled after the lighthouse at Alexandria, the center of learning for the ancient world.  During the Civil War this church was used as a hospital.  Forms part of the Ridley Wills II Nashville Postcards Collection.  1 postcard.  </dc:description>
