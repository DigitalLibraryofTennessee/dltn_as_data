<dc:title>Salvage scrap drive in Nashville and Middle Tennessee region, 1942</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pictured: &#8220;A typical schoolyard in Tennessee today: symbolic of the all-out activity by the school children of Nashville, Davidson County, and Tennessee in cooperation with official Scrap Day throughout the State, is this huge scrap pile at Jere Baxter School.  Every student at Jere Baxter was on the job bright and early today, searching the neighborhood for every available piece of scrap metal.  Much of the heavy scrap pictured above was collection from the former Masonic Home on Ben Allen Road now being converted into a State Tuberculosis Hospital.  The truck in the center of the picture is unloading some of the scrap metal from the Masonic Home &#8230;&#8221;  During World War II Americans were active with scrap drives to help the war effort.  Local communities were salvaging raw materials such as metal, rags, rubber, and paper to be used to supply troops.  These special home front war programs were often well-coordinated through committees that engaged widespread urban and rural participation and motivated patriotism and community spirit.
