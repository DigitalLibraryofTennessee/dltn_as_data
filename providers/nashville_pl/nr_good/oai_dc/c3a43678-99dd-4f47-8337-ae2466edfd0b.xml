<dc:description>Cavert School opened in September of 1928 for students in grades one through nine. The school was named for Dr. A.J. Cavert who served as principal at Howard, Fogg, Hume, Fall and Warner schools among others. Cavert became a junior high in 1936 when Eakin school was opened. An addition was made that same year, and a new gymnasium was built in 1964. In the fall of 1965, Cavert was phased out as a junior high and became a special education center. 11 x 14 in.</dc:description>
