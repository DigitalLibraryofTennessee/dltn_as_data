<dc:title>Letter from P.J. Williamson to his wife, Eunice during the Civil War, 1863 March 12</dc:title>
<dc:description>A letter from Dutch immigrant, Peter J. Williamson, back home to his wife, Eunice, during the Civil War.  In 1862 Williamson enlisted as a Private in the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, Company F and was ultimately promoted to Full 1st Lieutenant.  During the war, Williamson's regiment was involved in scouting and raids in Missouri and Arkansas and saw battle in the Middle Tennessee, Chickamauga, and Atlanta campaigns. In this letter from Cape Girardeau, Missouri, Williamson tells his wife of two photographs of himself that he has included with the letter and how he would like them to be used.  He predicts that he will probably be going to Bloomfield within days to operate under General McNeil.  He then speaks of the possibility of officers in Missouri receiving a furlough if other generals follow General Hooker's example.  He closes the letter and in a post script tells his wife to continue sending his mail to Cape Girardeau.  He also intends on getting Willie a military cap like his but does not know Willie's cap size.  Forms part of the Peter J. Williamson Letters. 1 letter : col. ; 8  x 10  in.</dc:description>
