<dc:title>Marriage Bond 1789</dc:title>
<dc:description>The marriage bond was a guarantee or promise that the couple had a legal right to be married. That is to say, the couple was of age, that neither was already married and that there was no other reason why they could not be married according to law. The bond was usually signed by the groom and another person who had promised to pay the bond if it became necessary to do so.  This person was called the bondsman. The bond was not to be paid unless it was found that the couple's marriage was in violation of the law. 5 x 7 in.</dc:description>
