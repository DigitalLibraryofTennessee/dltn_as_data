<dc:title>Letter from P.J. Williamson to his wife, Eunice, during the Civil War, 1862 March 31</dc:title>
<dc:description>A letter from Dutch immigrant, Peter J. Williamson back home to his wife, Eunice, during the Civil War.  In 1862, Williamson enlisted as a Private in the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, Company F and was ultimately promoted to Full 1st Lieutenant.  During the war, Williamson's regiment was involved in scouting and raids in Missouri and Arkansas and saw battle in the Middle Tennessee, Chickamauga, and Atlanta campaigns. In this letter from St. Louis, Williamson rejoices over the good news that his second son has been born.  He reports that most of the soldiers are ill with dysentery on account of the change of climate and water, but he assures his wife that he is well.  He reports that there are now about eighty people from his hometown of Appleton, Wisconsin, in the barracks and a total of four Wisconsin regiments with one more expected any day.  He accounts that one regiment was in a serious accident on their way to St. Louis where eleven were killed and sixty-eight were injured; however none of them had been from Appleton.  He also lets his wife know of his new appointment to Postmaster of his regiment which gives him plenty of exercise.  He ends by discussing money and asking Eunice to write soon and to include a likeness of their two sons.  Forms part of the Peter J. Williamson Letters. 1 letter : col. ; 7.75 x 5 in.</dc:description>
