<dc:title>Edgefield ferry along the Cumberland River, circa 1954</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pictured: The sturdy &#8220;Edgefield&#8221; ferry with an unidentified group of people along the Cumberland River.  Ferries were an important part of Davidson County Tennessee river history.  The ferry was started in 1871 by Joseph and Theodore Clees. Each boat, with its navigating captain, would transport cars and their passengers across the river.  The ferries became obsolete when bridges spanned the waterways and traffic changed.  The Edgefield ferry was built circa 1934, with a pilot house-engine room and paddle wheels.  Forms part of Record Group 412, Photographs Collection. 1 photograph negative : b &amp; w ; 4 x 5 in.</dc:description>
