<dc:title>Whip Behind!, between 1937 and 1944</dc:title>
<dc:description>An original political cartoon drawing created by Jack Knox, the Nashville Banner editorial cartoonist from the mid-1940s to early 1970s.  This particular cartoon was probably created during his eleven-year career with the Memphis Commercial Appeal.  In the cartoon, President Franklin D. Roosevelt is depicted as a man in a wagon cracking a whip ("Efforts to whip us up on foreign issues") over the horse ("US").  In the wagon, Uncle Sam looks astonished to notice two men trying to stop the wagon ("Congress just going along for the ride?").  The men holding the wheels are a U.S. Congressman and the isolationist labor leader John L. Lewis ("Non-defense pork" and "strike problems").  The Roosevelt-Lewis relationship deteriorated soon after the General Motors and Little Steel strikes of 1937.  Later, during the middle of World War II, Lewis, president of the United Mine Workers of America, headed the 1943 labor strike when the rest of labor was observing a policy against strikes.  Forms part of the Jack Knox Political Cartoon Collection. 1 original cartoon drawing : b &amp; w ; 16.25 x 24 in.</dc:description>
