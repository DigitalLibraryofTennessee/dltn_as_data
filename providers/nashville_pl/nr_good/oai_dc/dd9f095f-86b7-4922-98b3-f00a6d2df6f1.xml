<dc:title>Machinery Building at the Tennessee Centennial and International Exposition, circa 1897</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of Machinery Hall at the Tennessee Centennial and International Exposition, in whose splendid proportions and style was designed with the Parthenon as the prototype and the propylaeum gateway as a component part. This non-extant structure was built for the celebration of Tennessee's 100th year of statehood that opened May 1, 1897, at Nashville's Centennial Park (2814 West End Avenue), and continued for six months, closing on October 31, 1897. The formal celebration of Tennessee's 100th birthday occurred on June 1, 1896, with a grand inaugural day parade commemorating the centennial anniversary of Tennessee's statehood (Tennessee was admitted to the Union in 1796 as the 16th state). The Tennessee Centennial Exposition was a great success and drew approximately 1.8 million visitors. The interior of Machinery Hall featured great engines that furnished all the power for the Exposition-every electric light, inside and outside the buildings, and the lights on the grounds were powered by these engines. Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph, mounted: b &amp; w ; 4.25 x 5.25 in.</dc:description>
