<dc:title>Gala opening of the Tennessee Theatre, 1952 February 28</dc:title>
<dc:description>Kermit C. Stengel, Sr., a Nashville businessman, onstage at the gala opening of the Tennessee Theater, February 28, 1952 in Nashville, Tennessee.  This palatial Art Deco movie palace was located in downtown Nashville at 527 Church Street.  It featured a 2,000-seat auditorium adjoining the Sudekum Building.  On the night of this gala event, a Technicolor musical called &#8220;About Face&#8221; was booked and many onlookers watched the arrival and announcement of movie stars such as Gordon MacRae, Phyllis Kirk, Lex Barker, and others.  Many local VIPS attended the gala ceremony and Owen Bradley and his orchestra played inside on stage that night.  Some of the outside activities included broadcasts by WSIX radio and WSM television, a concert by the American Legion Post 5 band, and the arrival of the honored celebrities.
