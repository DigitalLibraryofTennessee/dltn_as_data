<dc:title>East Side of the Tennessee State Capitol Building, 1961 October 06</dc:title>
<dc:description>The construction area adjacent to the Tennessee State Office Building, located in downtown Nashville below the East Side of the Tennessee State Capitol, October 6th, 1961.  The Andrew Jackson equestrian statue and east side of the Capitol Building are in view.  The State Capitol was constructed between 1845 and 1859.  It was designed in Greek Revival style by architect William Strickland (1788-1854).  Strickland died before construction was completed and was interred in the walls of the north portico.  His son, Francis W. Strickland, oversaw the completion of the project.  The cupola was reputedly modeled on a Greek monument to Lysicrates and designed to be illuminated at night like a lantern.  The building was constructed of Tennessee Limestone and underwent major restoration from 1956-1960.  During the restoration, much of the limestone, including most in the cupola and the Ionic columns and capitals, was replaced with Indiana limestone. The grounds contain monuments to famous people and events in Tennessee history.  The Capitol was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.
