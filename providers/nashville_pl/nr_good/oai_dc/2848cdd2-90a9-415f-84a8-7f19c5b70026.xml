Briley, who was Mayor of Nashville from 1963 to 1975 and was the first mayor after the consolidation of the city and county government,  discusses his recognition in 1950 that the problems facing the city, such as no sewers, poor public health, and school taxes were symptoms of larger problems in the government's structure.
