<dc:title>Photograph of the fa&#231;ade of the Baxter Building, 216 Union Street, Nashville, Tennessee, 1959</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of the fa&#231;ade of the Baxter Building, 216 Union Street, Nashville, Tennessee, showing architectural features of the windows. The building once housed the Commercial Club, as well as a variety of offices and businesses. It appears in Nashville city directories from 1917 as the Baxter Building, a name previously applied to a building on Broadway. The name of Nashville attorney, Morris Levine, can be seen printed on one window. The building was demolished in the 1970s as part of an urban renewal project. Photographed by the Nashville architect Charles Wesley Warterfield, Jr. (1926-1998); the architectural photograph forms part of the Charles Warterfield Architectural Collection. Gift of: The Estate of Charles W. Warterfield, Jr., F. A. I. A. The original is a 35 mm color transparency (2 x 2 in. slide mount)</dc:description>
