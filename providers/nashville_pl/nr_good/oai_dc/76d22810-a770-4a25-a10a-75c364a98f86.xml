<dc:description>A photograph, circa 1962, of an airline stewardess reading a book in the Nashville Public Library Airport Reading Room, the first branch library reading room ever to be established in a Municipal Airport. The Airport Reading Room was established during the tenure of Chief Librarian David Marshall Stewart, with Mrs. Mary Clark as the branch librarian. The facility had been developed alongside the new 145,900 square-foot passenger terminal that opened in 1961, during Mayor Ben West's term. The reading room officially opened to the public in 1962, and was active until 1969. Photographed by Milton McClurkan. Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph : b &amp; w ; 8 x 10 in.</dc:description>
