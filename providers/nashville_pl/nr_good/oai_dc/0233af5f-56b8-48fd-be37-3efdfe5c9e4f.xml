<dc:title>Photograph of Nashville Public Library staff members shelving books in the bookmobile, circa 1955</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of Nashville Public Library staff members placing books on the shelves of the Nashville Public Library bookmobile, circa April 1955. This particular bookmobile was in service from 1954-1973, with approximately 3000 volumes aboard the vehicle. The staff members pictured in the photograph (from left to right) are Miss Diane O'Donnell, assistant librarian, Paul Law, driver and assistant; and Mrs. Grace Darden, librarian. The bookmobile service in Davidson County, Tennessee originally began in the 1940's, when the State Library Project furnished a bookmobile which made weekly demonstration rounds through the county. In 1947, the Nashville Public Library initiated the "library-on-wheels" bookmobile service; by 1956, service had been extended to all of Davidson County. Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection.1 photograph : b &amp; w ; 8 x 10 in.</dc:description>
