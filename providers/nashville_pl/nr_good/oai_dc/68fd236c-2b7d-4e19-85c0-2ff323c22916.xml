<dc:title>Aerial photograph of North Nashville, ca. 1968</dc:title>
<dc:description>Aerial photograph of a portion of North Nashville, in the Jefferson Street area, looking southwest, circa 1968, taken by Metro Photographer, William M. King. The area is primarily residential, although there appear to be numerous vacant lots in the center portion of the picture. Streets identified on the photograph include: Monroe Street; Cheatham Place; 11th Avenue North; 12th Avenue North; 14th Avenue North; and Jefferson Street. Not labelled, but running left to right from 11th Avenue to 14th Avenue, with no cars on it and few buildings, is Scovel Street. Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph : b &amp; w ; 8 x 10 in.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Interstate 265 would pass through this location when it was built between 1968 and 1971. It joined Interstate 40 in a major interchange at this location, composing the northwest portion of the downtown inner loop. In 2000, Interstate 265 ceased to exist, and was redesignated as part of Interstate 65. Jefferson Street, shown in this photograph, was the center of black life and culture in Nashville at this time, and the construction of the interstate destroyed significant portions of this important social and cultural hub.</dc:description>
