<dc:title>Letter from P.J. Williamson to his wife, Eunice, during the Civil War, 1864 September 26</dc:title>
<dc:description>A letter from Dutch immigrant, Peter J. Williamson, back home to his wife, Eunice, during the Civil War.  In 1862 Williamson enlisted as a Private in the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, Company F and was ultimately promoted to Full 1st Lieutenant.  During the war, Williamson's regiment was involved in scouting and raids in Missouri and Arkansas and saw battle in the Middle Tennessee, Chickamauga, and Atlanta campaigns. In this letter from Franklin, Tennessee, Williamson is disappointed to have not gotten paid yet due to General Forrest and General Wheeler's continued raids.  He describes the Federal response and how the overall situation affects her visit, which now looks unlikely.  He states that he expects to be home soon and tells her of an encounter in Nashville with some people they know.  He expresses his frustration at not being able to see her and refers to the possibility of their separation ending soon.  He relates news of Lieutenant Colonel Torrey's death as garnered from a Confederate prisoner and fears it to be true.  He closes by telling her to direct her letters as usual and that he will write in a day or two.  Forms part of the Peter J. Williamson Letters. 1 letter : col. ; 8  x 10 in.</dc:description>
