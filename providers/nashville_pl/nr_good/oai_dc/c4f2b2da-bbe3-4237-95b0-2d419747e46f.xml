<dc:title>Holy Rosary Cathedral historical marker, Nashville, Tennessee, 1978 July </dc:title>
<dc:description>An historical marker for the Holy Rosary Cathedral in Davidson County,  Tennessee that reads: &#8220;Near here in 1820 the first Catholic Church in Tennessee was built by Irish Catholic workers then building a bridge over Cumberland River.  In 1830 a brick structure known as Holy Rosary Cathedral succeeded the frame building.  Here Bishop R.P. Miles, first Bishop of Tennessee was installed Oct. 15, 1838.  When St. Mary&#8217;s Cathedral was built in 1847, Holy Rosary Church became S. John&#8217;s Hospital &amp; Orphanage.  The site was sold to the state in 1857. &#8220; This marker is located on the Tennessee State Capitol Grounds, 6th Avenue N, Nashville, Tennessee.  Forms part of the Claynita Harris Slide Collection.  The original is a 35 mm color transparency (2 x 2 in. slide mount) </dc:description>
