<dc:title>Tennessee State Office Building, Nashville, Tenn., circa 1949</dc:title>
<dc:description>A postcard of the Tennessee State Office Building, located east of the Capitol at 500 Charlotte Avenue in Nashville, Tennessee.  The 108,349 square foot building is an example of the "New Deal" era style of government buildings constructed in the 1930s.  This building is known for housing famous Tennessee historical murals by Dean Cornwell.  The murals give the pictorial history of Tennessee starting with the first white men who stopped on the bluffs near Memphis.  The art was completed in the 1940s.  Today the building is called the John Sevier Building after Nashville's first governor.  Forms part of the Nashville Room Postcard Collection. 1 postcard : col. ; 3.5  x 5.5  in.</dc:description>
