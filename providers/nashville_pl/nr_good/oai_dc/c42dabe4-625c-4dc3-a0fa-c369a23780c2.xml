<dc:title>Letter from P.J. Williamson to his wife, Eunice, 1869 October 22</dc:title>
<dc:description>A letter from Dutch immigrant, Peter J. Williamson, to his wife, Eunice, in the years following the Civil War.  In 1862 Williamson enlisted as a Private in the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, Company F and was ultimately promoted to Full 1st Lieutenant.  During the war, Williamson's regiment was involved in scouting and raids in Missouri and Arkansas and saw battle in the Middle Tennessee, Chickamauga, and Atlanta campaigns. After the war, he and his family settled in Nashville and he became an architect.  In this letter from Nashville, Tennessee, Williamson is pleased that Eunice's health is improving.  He laments the distance between them and discusses the possibility of William advancing them the money for her return trip.  He further mentions their sons, Willy and Johnny, and how they miss her.  He relates news of the State Fair and the weather's impact on it.  He reports that Mrs. Stewart has been murdered and references the Banner's article on the matter.  He closes by hoping to hear in her next letter when she will be returning home and in a post script reports that he has had a cold which is not quite well.  Forms part of the Peter J. Williamson Letters. 1 letter : col. ; 8 x 10 in.</dc:description>
