<dc:title>Monroe Street United Methodist Church</dc:title>
<dc:description>Dedicated in July of 1906, Monroe Street United Methodist Church began as an offspring of the North High Street Methodist Church.  The building was designed by Reverend James E. Woodward, and Reverend E. M. Harrell served as the first pastor in the Monroe Street edifice.  One of the better known features of the church are its stained glass windows which depict Bible stories.  In 1979, Monroe Street UMC was listed on the National Register as a historic landmark.
