<dc:title>Cleveland Street Baptist Church, 2001 December</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of Cleveland Street Baptist Church located at 608 Cleveland Street in Nashville, Tennessee.  This church was founded in 1889 as a small mission known as North Street Baptist Church. It was started by the Reverend William Bailey in a double tenement house.  In the early 1920s the original church was destroyed, forcing the congregation to relocate under the Cleveland Street viaduct.  Construction on the new Cleveland Street Baptist Church was finished in 1929.  Plans for a new edifice were accomplished in the 1970s.  Over the years, the church has had affiliation with Boy and Girl Scout troops, the Nurse's Guild and the Beautifying Club.  The foundation is brown brick.  The exterior walls are brown brick.  The roof is gabled with tar shingles.  The doors are glass with metal frames.  Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4  x 6  in.</dc:description>
