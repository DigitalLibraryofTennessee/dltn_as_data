<dc:title>Exhibit at the Tennessee State Fair, Nashville, Tennessee, 1969 September</dc:title>
<dc:description>Three youth at a Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County safety sign exhibit featured at the Tennessee State Fair in Nashville, Tennessee, September, 1969.  The fairgrounds, located approx. one mile south of downtown Nashville, opened in 1891 as Cumberland Park. The park was built as a harness racing track with a grandstand that seated 7,000 people. In 1904 the harness racing track hosted its first automobile race. In 1906 the first Tennessee State Fair was held. Over the years, the fairgrounds have been host to nighttime airplane rides, a swimming pool, an amusement park, and stock car races, among other things. In 1965 a fire at the fairgrounds destroyed several buildings, the grandstands and numerous restaurants. Today the fairgrounds are used for various conferences, expos, and trade shows, along with the annual Tennessee State Fair. Forms part of Record Group 300, Tennessee State Fair Collection.  1 photograph : b &amp; w.  </dc:description>
