<dc:title>Advertisement from Nashville City Directory, 1871 </dc:title>
<dc:description>An advertisement of the Western &amp; Atlantic Railroad Company, published in the 1871 Nashville City Directory.  The President was Joseph E. Brown.  The General Superintendent of the company was Col. E.W. Cole, a former Confederate officer who became a railroad tycoon. The 137-mile line between Atlanta and Chattanooga was built in 1841-50 by the State of Georgia at a cost of almost five million dollars.  It was a foundation for Atlanta&#8217;s emergence as a rail center and the W&amp;A became a primary link in the chain of Southern railroads connecting the Atlantic Ocean and the Mississippi River.  Forms part of Nashville City Directory Collection, Metro Archives. 1 digital image. </dc:description>
