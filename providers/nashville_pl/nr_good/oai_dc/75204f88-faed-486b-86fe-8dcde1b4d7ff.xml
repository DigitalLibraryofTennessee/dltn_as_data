<dc:title>Photograph of the old Elks Lodge in downtown Nashville, Tennessee, circa 1959</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of the old Elks Lodge no. 72, located at 310 6th Avenue North, bordered by Deaderick Street, in downtown Nashville, Tennessee. The lodge was home to the Elks, beginning in 1904, serving numerous community functions and charity projects for the next several decades.  The adjacent high-rise building is the Andrew Jackson Hotel. Both the Andrew Jackson Hotel and the old Elks Club lodge are non-extant architecture. The exact date of the construction of the Elks Lodge is unknown, although it appears as a dwelling on the 1888 fire insurance maps. The building housed the lodge offices, a library, and entertainment facilities. It was razed in the 1970's to make way for the James K. Polk State Office Building and the Tennessee Performing Arts Center. Photographed by the Nashville architect Charles Wesley Warterfield, Jr. (1926-1998); the architectural photograph forms part of the Charles Warterfield Architectural Collection. Gift of: The Estate of Charles W. Warterfield, Jr., F. A. I. A. The original is a 35 mm color transparency (2 x 2 in. slide mount)</dc:description>
