<dc:title>Belmont Church, 2002 January</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of Belmont Church, now located at 64 Music Square East.  Originally the church was called Belmont Avenue Church of Christ and had an address of 64 Sixteenth Avenue South.  While today the church has a non-denominational congregation, its historic roots still lie with the Church of Christ movement of the early 20th century.  In the 1970s Belmont Avenue Church of Christ changed its name to Belmont Church and dropped all affiliation with the Church of Christ denomination.  The foundation of the original chapel is comprised of rough cut stone blocks and smooth cut stone capping blocks.  The exterior walls are tan brick with stone accents.  The roof is gabled with tar shingles.  The windows are tall stained glass, three paned windows.  The entranceway to the chapel features four brick columns.  Special features include stained glass windows.  This original building is no longer used for services, as a new worship center was built for this purpose.  Instead the historic chapel is used primarily as the church's conference center and holds 150 people in a movie-theatre-style seating arrangement.  The center is equipped with full A/V capabilities which were upgraded in 2004. The conference center hosts numerous events including teaching, ministry and worship and is becoming a popular meeting place for organizations on Music Row.  Attached to the rear of the original chapel, a new brick building boasts large clear glass windows and modern architecture.  This building is the new Worship Center where Sunday services take place.  Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4  x 6  in.</dc:description>
