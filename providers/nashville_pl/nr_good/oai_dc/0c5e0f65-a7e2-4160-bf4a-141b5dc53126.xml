<dc:description>An invitation from Governor Prentice Cooper, Judge Litton Hickman, and Mayor Thomas L. Cummings, to the formal dedication of the Nashville division of Vultee Aircraft Inc., to take place on May 4th, 1941.  The Vultee logo accompanies the state flag as the invitation header.  Vultee was a division of Aviation Corporation (Avco), and during World War II employed nearly 7,000 workers. The Nashville factory built O-49 observation planes, A-35 Vultee Vengeance dive bombers, and P-38 Lightning fighters during World War II.  Near the end of the war, Vultee merged with Consolidated Aircraft to become Consolidated Vultee, then Avco.  Immediately after the war, the plant produced home appliances and other items through most of the 1950s, but continued producing airplane parts as well.  Over the years Vultee produced more than 10,000 wings and tail sections, among them helicopter parts used by the military in Vietnam.
