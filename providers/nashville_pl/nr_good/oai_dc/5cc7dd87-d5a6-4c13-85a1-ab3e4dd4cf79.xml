<dc:title>Salvage scrap drive in Nashville and Middle Tennessee region, 1942 October</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pictured: &#8220;Bottling industry aids scrap collection: a fleet of trucks from the Seven-Up Bottling Company &#8230; devoted their entire day to the collection of scrap metal from local schools entered in the Banner drive, as did other local bottling trucks.  The trucks are pictured following delivery of a total of 43,670 pounds of scrap to the grounds of the City Testing Station, official county storage place.  The collections were made at Woodmont, West End High, Park Avenue, and Hillsboro High Schools.  Alvin G. Beaman, president of the Seven-Up Company, is chairman of the local bottling industry scrap collection drive.&#8221;  During World War II Americans were active with scrap drives to help the war effort.  Local communities were salvaging raw materials such as metal, rags, rubber, and paper to be used to supply troops.  These special home front war programs were often well-coordinated through committees that engaged widespread urban and rural participation and motivated patriotism and community spirit.
