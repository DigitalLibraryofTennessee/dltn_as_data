<dc:title>Aerials of Berry Field and Vultee, Nashville, Tennessee, 1946 February</dc:title>
<dc:description>An aerial view of Berry Field and the adjacent &#8220;Vultee&#8221; plant, February, 1946.  In 1943, Vultee Aircraft Corporation merged with the Consolidated Aircraft Corporation (Convair).  At the end of World War II, the plant in Nashville had a surplus of manufacturing capacity available and the parent Convair firm started the transit-car production.  Nashville's airport officially opened in 1937 as Berry Field, in honor of Colonel Harry S. Berry, the state administrator of the Works Progress Administrator, or WPA. Berry Field became the military base for the 4th Ferrying Command during World War II and was returned to the city when the war ended. The airport&#8217;s name was officially changed to Nashville International Airport in 1988, but the original three-letters BNA, which stands for Berry Field Nashville, remains. Forms part of Record Group 412, Photographs Collection. 1 photograph negative : b &amp; w ; 4 x 5 in.</dc:description>
