<dc:title>Westminster Presbyterian Church, 2001 September</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of Westminster Presbyterian Church located at 3900 West End Avenue in the West End neighborhood of Nashville, Tennessee.  This church was built in 1938 to serve the congregation of Moore Memorial Church, which started out as a small Sunday school class in the early 1870s.  The congregation officially changed its name to Westminster Presbyterian before moving into the new church building.  The foundation is brick.  The exterior walls are brick.  The roof is gabled with tar shingles.  The large sanctuary windows at the top of the structure have frosted pink glass panes.  There are small clear glass windows at the base of the sanctuary.  The doors are wood.  Special features include four Corinthian columns supporting a portico, a needle shaped steeple, arched windows, and a pediment above the entryway.  Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4  x 6  in.</dc:description>
