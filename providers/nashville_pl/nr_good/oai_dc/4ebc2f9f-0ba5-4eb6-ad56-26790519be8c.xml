<dc:title>Cumberland River Wharf, Nashville, 1926</dc:title>
<dc:description>A postcard of the Cumberland River Wharf in downtown Nashville.  Several boats are visible near the river bank.  The thriving businesses of First and Second Avenues are also noticeable, with advertisements visible for H.G. Lipscomb &amp; Co. and Sherwin Williams Paints.  An additional title on the card reads "Nashville, the Powder City of the World."  This nickname refers to the powder plant built and operated in 1918 by the E I duPont deNemours Company for the United States Government to make smokeless gun powder for the Allied Armies in World War I.  This plant was constructed in Old Hickory, just 15 miles outside of downtown.  Soon the plant was producing 750,000 pounds of powder every 24 hours.  Forms part of the Norton Postcard Collection. 1 postcard : col. ; 3.5  x 5.5  in.</dc:description>
