<dc:title>St. Augustine's Episcopal Chapel, 2001 May 25</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of St. Augustine Episcopal Chapel located at 200 Twenty-fourth Avenue South on the campus of Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.  This West End neighborhood chapel was started in the mid 1950s with seed money from nearby St. George's Episcopal and Christ Church Episcopal.  The foundation is made of brick and concrete.  The exterior walls are composed of red brick and wood siding.  The roof is gabled and is in an A-frame design down to the ground over the chapel.  It is composed of asphalt shingles.  The other portions of the church are covered by a flat roof.  The windows are clear glass with wood frames.  The doors are made of wood and some have clear glass panes.  Special features include a tall wooded cross in the front yard and colored glass in the sanctuary.  Currently Saint Augustine's Episcopal Chapel also houses chaplains from and holds services for the United Methodist and Presbyterian ministries on campus.  Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4  x 6  in.</dc:description>
