<dc:title>Coffer Dam East Channel Pier, Broadway Bridge, Foster-Creighton-Gould, 1909</dc:title>
<dc:description>The Coffer Dam East Channel Pier, Broadway Bridge, in 1909 when the Sparkman Bridge (Shelby Street Bridge) was being constructed by the Foster &amp; Creighton Company. This is along the Cumberland River in downtown Nashville. The construction on the Sparkman Street Bridge, later renamed Shelby Street Bridge was completed in 1909, spanning the Cumberland River to link East Nashville to the downtown area. The construction of this bridge was considered very innovative, with concrete trusses making a new underneath support system. The Nashville Bridge Company can be seen in the background on the east side of the river. The Foster &amp; Creighton Company were the contractors for the bridge (specifically Foster-Creighton-Gould Company), a family-owned construction company founded in Nashville circa 1885 by Wilbur Fisk Foster and Robert T. Creighton. Some of their early works included the Parthenon, Union Station, and the Sparkman/Shelby Street Bridges. In 1986, the bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In 2003, the bridge reopened as a pedestrian walkway. The bridge was the first one in North America to have concrete arched trusses. Howard M. Jones, a railroad engineer, was employed by the county as its designer. The original official name was the Broadway Bridge. Forms part of the Foster &amp; Creighton General Contractors Collection. 1 photograph : sepia ; 8 x 10.</dc:description>
