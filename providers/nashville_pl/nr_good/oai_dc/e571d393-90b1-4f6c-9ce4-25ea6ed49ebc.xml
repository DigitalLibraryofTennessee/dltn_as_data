<dc:title>Photograph of the Davidson County Court House, circa 1930</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of Policeman, Sgt. Lonnie G. Martin directing traffic outside of the Davidson County Court House circa 1930.  The courthouse was designed in 1857 by Francis Strickland, son of William Strickland, who built the State Capitol.  Construction on the building started in 1859 and finished in 1863.  This Strickland Courthouse served as the epicenter for a bustling Nashville for eighty years.  In 1909-1910 the Court House was remodeled and enlarged by the replacement of its gable roof with a fourth story as pictured in this photograph.  The building was demolished in 1935, and in 1937 the present Metropolitan Court House was completed to replace it.  Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph : b &amp; w ; 8 x 10 in.</dc:description>
