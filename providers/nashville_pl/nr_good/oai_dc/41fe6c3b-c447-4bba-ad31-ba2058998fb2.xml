<dc:title>St. George's Episcopal Church, circa 2001</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of St. George's Episcopal Church located at 4715 Harding Road in Nashville, Tennessee.  The cornerstone was laid in 1949.  Donald W. Southgate was the architect for the project, and he designed the building in a Greek Revival style.  In 1954 a Sunday school building was added, and in 1967 another addition, the Jane Tompkins Weeks Memorial Chapel, was finished.  A new nave, sanctuary and sacristy were completed in 1986.  The exterior walls are brick.  The roof is mainly gabled and made of tar shingles.  There are lunette windows over the front doors.  One oculus window adorns the front facade.  Most other windows are square with clear glass panes.  The doors are wood.  Special features include an octagonal steeple with oculus windows on each side the base, ionic columns at the entryway, and a portico.  Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4  x 6  in.</dc:description>
