<dc:title>Church of the Advent, Episcopal</dc:title>
<dc:description>Church of the Advent, Episcopal,  was organized in 1857 by 58 communicants of Christ Episcopal Church and its rector the Rev. Charles Tomes after a disagreement over pew rentals.  Rev. Tomes died soon after the group formed, and the Rev. Charles T. Quintard became pastor.  The first building used by the congregation was built about 1860 at 7th Ave. and Commerce St.    In 1917 the Advent Church was moved to a new location, into the pictured building, on 17th Ave. So.  The cornerstone of the building is the same marker that had been placed during the American Civil War in the church's old building.  In 1972 the congregation moved into a new building on Franklin Road. 3 x 5 in.</dc:description>
