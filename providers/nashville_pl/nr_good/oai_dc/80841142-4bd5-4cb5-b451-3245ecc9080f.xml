<dc:title>Woodmont Christian Church, circa 2001</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of Woodmont Christian Church located at 3601 Hillsboro Road in the Hillsboro neighborhood of Nashville, Tennessee.  The church was founded in 1943 by members from the Vine Street Christian Church.  The church first met in Woodmont School, but came to this site within the year.  The present sanctuary was reconstructed in 1948.  The former sanctuary is now used as a church office.  The exterior walls are brick.  The roof is gabled and made of tar shingles.  The windows are mostly square and shuttered in the sanctuary.  The front door is arched and made of wood.  Special features include an oculus over the front door, a tall needle style steeple, and a cloister style wing to the left of the front door.  Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4  x 6  in.</dc:description>
