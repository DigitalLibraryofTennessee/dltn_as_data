<dc:title>Salvage scrap drive in Nashville and Middle Tennessee region, 1942 October</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pictured: &#8220;Antioch High School &#8216;Scrap&#8217; for Victory: approximately 30 tons of scrap metal have already been piled up at Antioch High School by its 200 students under the direction of the Future Farmers Club and M. D. Capps sponsor.  The area surrounding the school has been divided into three zones, and the zone workers collection the scrap by October 31 are promised a half-holiday.  Thomas Lewis is student chairman of the campaign.  A War Bond will be purchased with the proceeds from the sale of the scrap by the school, Capps said.&#8221; During World War II Americans were active with scrap drives to help the war effort.  Local communities were salvaging raw materials such as metal, rags, rubber, and paper to be used to supply troops.  These special home front war programs were often well-coordinated through committees that engaged widespread urban and rural participation and motivated patriotism and community spirit.
