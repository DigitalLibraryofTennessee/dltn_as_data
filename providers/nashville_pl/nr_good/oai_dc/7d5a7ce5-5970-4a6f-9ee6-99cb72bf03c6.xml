<dc:title>Portrait of an unknown man, possibly Cordell Hull, 1945</dc:title>
<dc:description>An older man, seated, with grey hair, wearing a dark business suit, white shirt, and red tie.  Subject of portrait unknown, although it may be Representative, Senator, Secretary of State, "Father of the United Nations," and 1945 Nobel Peace Prize-winner Cordell Hull.  Hull would have been in his mid-60s at the time the portrait was painted.  Oil on canvas.  Unknown provenance.  The portrait is currently on display in the Nashville Room on the Nashville Public Library's second floor.  

The library's portraits were photographed as part of the National Society of The Colonial Dames of America in Tennessee's Tennessee Portrait Project (http://www.tnportraits.org/index.htm).</dc:description>
