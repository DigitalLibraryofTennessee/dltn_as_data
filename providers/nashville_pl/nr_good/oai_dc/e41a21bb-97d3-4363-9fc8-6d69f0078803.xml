<dc:title>Lockeland Baptist Church, 2001 January</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of Lockeland Baptist Church located at 1601 Holly Street, Nashville, Tennessee.  The Lockeland Baptist congregation was founded in 1903, and according to the Sacred Sites Project survey form, the main church was built in 1929.  A portion of the building, however, was constructed in 1903 and is still used today as an educational building.  The foundation of the church is brick.  The exterior walls are brick.  There is an asphalt shingle roof and marbleized glass window panes.  The doors are glass with wooden frames.  Special features include a three-story rectangular brick addition built on the East side of the sanctuary.  Related structures include a parsonage built in the 1950s and an education building that was built in 1952.  The church was built by the Architecture Department of the Baptist Sunday School Board located on Ninth Avenue North, in Nashville.  Many members of the Architecture Department belonged to Lockeland and used the construction of their home church as a way to test plans and designs.  This church provided space for the operations of the Christian Women's Job Corps from 1993 until 2003.  After seven years at Lockeland, the organization moved headquarters to the Downtown Ministry Center at 128 Eighth Avenue South.  Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4  x 6  in.</dc:description>
