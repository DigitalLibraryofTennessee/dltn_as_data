<dc:title>Photograph of Nashville Iron, Steel &amp; Charcoal Company, 1887</dc:title>
<dc:description>A sepia-toned photograph of the Nashville Iron, Steel &amp; Charcoal Company in 1887.  Men with horses and buggies appear in the foreground, while the industrial plant soars behind them.  Since this company does not appear in the Nashville city directories of the time period, it is assumed that the company was located outside of the downtown limits.  A note on the back indicates that the corporation dismantled in 1892.  This photograph was made by Thuss, Koellein &amp; Giers Photography, a prominent Nashville business.  Their studio was located at 139 Union Street.  Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph : b &amp; w ; 8.5 x 5 in.</dc:description>
