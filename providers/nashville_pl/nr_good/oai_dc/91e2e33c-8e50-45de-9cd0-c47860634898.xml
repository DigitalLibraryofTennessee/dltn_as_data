<dc:title>Seay-Hubbard United Methodist Church, 2001 December</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of Seay-Hubbard Methodist Church located at 1116 First Avenue South in Nashville, Tennessee.  Founded in 1875, this church originally began as Seay's Chapel at 1108 First Avenue South, just a few blocks away from its current location.  One year later, in 1876, Meharry Medical College was organized by the Methodist church as a result of the need for health services for the freed African slaves.  Located right down the road from the campus, Meharry College naturally benefited from Seay's outreach efforts.   After several years, the Meharry campus moved to its present location in North Nashville.  Soon after, Seay's chapel followed to the new campus and merged with the campus church, Hubbard's Chapel, to form the current Seay-Hubbard Methodist Church.  After several years of worshipping in the campus auditorium, Seay-Hubbard purchased three corner lots from Meharry that were located at the campus's original location on First Avenue South.  In 1953 the current building was erected.  The architecture style is Gothic Revival.  The foundation is made of cut limestone.  The exterior walls are red brick.  The windows are in the pointed arch style.  The doors are wood panel.  Special features include a circular stained glass window.  Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4  x 6  in.</dc:description>
