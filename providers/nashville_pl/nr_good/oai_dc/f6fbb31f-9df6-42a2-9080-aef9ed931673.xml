<dc:title>The Nashville Theatre, circa 1859</dc:title>
<dc:description>A page from a mounted and bound volume of twenty-five pen-and-ink wash drawings, and two pen-and-ink maps of Nashville created by William A. Eichbaum during the 1850s.

This theatre was designed by Adolphus Heinman and constructed in 1850.  It was located on the west side of North Cherry Street (Fourth Avenue) near Cedar Street (Charlotte Avenue).  After the opening, William Strickland, who was then at work on the Tennessee State Capitol building, was hired to add a tier of seating to accommodate more patrons.  Additional names that the Nashville Theatre was known by include Grand Opera House, Gaiety Theatre, Nashville Opera House, and the Bijou Theater.  Forms part of the William A. Eichbaum Sketchbook. 1 drawing : col. ; 5.75  x 9  in.</dc:description>
