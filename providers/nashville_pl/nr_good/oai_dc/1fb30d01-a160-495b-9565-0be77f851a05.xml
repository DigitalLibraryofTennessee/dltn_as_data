<dc:title>East End United Methodist Church, 2000 October</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of East End Methodist Church located at 1212 Holly Street in Nashville, Tennessee, in the East Nashville neighborhood.  While the congregation was established in 1889, the current church was completed in 1907.  Built of red brick, the church is a Victorian adaptation of the Romanesque style.  The bell tower which dominates the front facade has elements of a medieval fortress.  The foundation is stone.  The windows vary in size and have either stained glass or plexi-glass panes.  The doors are made of wood.  Other features on the exterior include large block modillions or brackets under the roof eaves, terra cotta detailing outlining the large round-headed window at the entrance, cut stone bands used for horizontal emphasis, buttress piers supporting the east and west walls and a stone retaining wall.  The sanctuary is neoclassical in style.  Special features of the interior include the dark-stained woodwork, richly colored stained glass windows, and a large pipe organ.  Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4  x 6  in.</dc:description>
