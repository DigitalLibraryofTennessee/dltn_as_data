<dc:title>Sparkman Street Bridge, Nashville, Tenn., circa 1910</dc:title>
<dc:description>A color postcard of the Sparkman Street Bridge, renamed Shelby Street Bridge.  The bridge was completed in 1909, spanning the Cumberland River to link East Nashville to Downtown.  At completion, the bridge was hailed as the "finest highway bridge south of the Ohio River."  Construction of the bridge was considered innovative.  Concrete trusses created a new underneath support system in order to take the bridge across the railroad tracks on the river's west bank.  In 1986, the bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places.  In 2003, the bridge reopened after five years as a pedestrian walkway.  Forms part of the Nashville Room Postcard Collection. 1 postcard : col. ; 3.5  x 5.5  in.</dc:description>
