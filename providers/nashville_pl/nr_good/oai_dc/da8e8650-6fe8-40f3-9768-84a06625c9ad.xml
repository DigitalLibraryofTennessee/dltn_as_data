<dc:title>Broadway Post Office, Nashville, Tennessee, 1968 November</dc:title>
<dc:description>An exterior view of the U.S. Post Office, located at 901 Broadway in downtown Nashville, Tennessee, circa November 1968.  The historical post office was constructed from 1933 to 1934 under the direction of the local architectural firm of Marr &amp; Holman, the building was financed by monies appropriated by Congress during the Hoover administration. Following guidelines from the Office of the Supervising Architect for such public buildings, Nashville&#8217;s post office displays both of the most distinctive architectural styles of the period: classicism and Art Deco. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Sites in 1984. It served as the main U.S. Post Office for Nashville until 1986, when a new central processing facility opened in Donelson. It continued to serve as a downtown branch of the post office after that time. The building was transferred to the city of Nashville in 1998 in preparation for its use as the home to the Frist Center for the Visual Arts.   Forms part of the Alfred Lane Futrell Collection.  1 photograph. </dc:description>
