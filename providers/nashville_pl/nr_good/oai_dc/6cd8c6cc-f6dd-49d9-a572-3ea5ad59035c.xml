<dc:title>Glimpses of Nashville, Tennessee: The Parthenon  </dc:title>
<dc:description>A view of the Parthenon at Centennial Park, Nashville, Tennessee, circa 1904. The Parthenon, located in Centennial Park, is a reproduction of the Greek Athenian Temple. This full scale replica was originally constructed out of wood, plaster and brick as a temporary exhibit for the Tennessee Centennial Exposition in 1897. A permanent version of Parthenon was constructed out of concrete in 1921-1931 to replace the one built for the exposition. The Nashville Parthenon underwent major renovations in 1991-2001. It now serves as a museum and art gallery and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.  Forms part of Glimpses of Nashville. 1 booklet </dc:description>
