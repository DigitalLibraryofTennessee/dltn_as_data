<dc:title>Photograph of columns and archway at the Hermitage Hotel, Nashville, Tennessee, circa 1980s</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of coupled Ionic columns and archway of the Hermitage Hotel, 231 Sixth Avenue North, Nashville, Tennessee. The building was designed by Tennessee architect J. Edwin Carpenter (1867-1932) in the Beaux Arts style and built between 1908 and 1910. Over the years it served as a center for the social and political life of Nashville, providing accommodations to visiting celebrities, U.S. Presidents, and foreign dignitaries. It was the headquarters for the Tennessee Democratic Party and for both factions in the battle to ratify woman suffrage in 1920. Francis Craig and his orchestra performed there from 1929 to 1945, part of that time including the broadcast of a radio show featuring their music. The hotel closed in the late1970s, but was renovated and reopened in 1980. It underwent further renovation in 1994-1995. Photographed by the Nashville architect Charles Wesley Warterfield, Jr. (1926-1998); the architectural photograph forms part of the Charles Warterfield Architectural Collection. Gift of: The Estate of Charles W. Warterfield, Jr., F. A. I. A. The original is a 35 mm color transparency (2 x 2 in. slide mount)</dc:description>
