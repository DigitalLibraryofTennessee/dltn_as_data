<dc:description>&#8220;Womanless weddings&#8221; in America were popular social events where prominent male members of a community would play the parts of both women and men in a satirical wedding ceremony. They were typically performed both for fun and to raise money for charitable causes, while poking fun at gender stereotypes. They were particularly popular in the South and Midwest regions of the U.S. This particular event was held to support the Tennessee branch of &#8220;Le Bien Etre du Blesse&#8221; (Welfare of the Wounded), an organization which delivered food and supplies to injured French soldiers during the First World War.  </dc:description>
