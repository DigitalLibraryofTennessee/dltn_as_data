<dc:title>Aerial views of Nashville airport, circa 1960s</dc:title>
<dc:description>Aerial photographs of the Nashville airport, circa the 1960s.  In 1961 officials opened a new 145,900-square-foot terminal with a modern control tower that boasted state-of-the-art electronics. In 1963 the existing runway was extended, and construction began on a second runway. Nashville's airport officially opened in 1937 as Berry Field, in honor of Colonel Harry S. Berry, the state administrator of the Works Progress Administrator, or WPA. Berry Field became the military base for the 4th Ferrying Command during World War II and was returned to the city when the war ended. The airport&#8217;s name was officially changed to Nashville International Airport in 1988, but the original three-letters BNA, which stands for Berry Field Nashville, remains. Forms part of Record Group 3, Metro Davidson County Photographer. 3 photograph negatives : b &amp; w ; 4 x 5 in.</dc:description>
