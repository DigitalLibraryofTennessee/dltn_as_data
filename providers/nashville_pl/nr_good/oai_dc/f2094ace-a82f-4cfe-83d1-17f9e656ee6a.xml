In 1953 Harvey&#8217;s Department Store began sponsoring this special exhibition and was on view yearly during the Christmas season.  Thousands of Nashvillians were drawn to Centennial Park by the beauty of this life-size cre&#768;che.  The sculpted design was created by Guido Rabacini and made by the Silvestri Art Manufacturing Company of Chicago at a cost of approximately $20,000.  The last year the nativity scene was on display was 1967.  Forms part of Record Group 3, Metro Davidson County Photographer. 1 photograph negative : b &amp; w ; 4 x 5 in.</dc:description>
