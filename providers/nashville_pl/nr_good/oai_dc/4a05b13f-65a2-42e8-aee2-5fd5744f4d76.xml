<dc:title>Cameron Junior High School, Nashville, Tennessee, n.d. </dc:title>
<dc:description>An exterior view of Cameron Junior High School, located in Nashville, Tennessee.  The school is named for Lt. Henry A. Cameron, a former teacher of science at Pearl High School, who lost his life on Flanders Field in France during World War I.  It had its beginnings in 1924 in the old Pearl High Building located on Fifth Avenue South and was named Pearl Junior High by the Nashville Board of Education.  At the same time, the school consisted of grades 1-5 and 7-9.  The sixth grade attended Napier.  A few years later the Board changed the name from Pearl Junior High to Cameron High.  In 1940, the school moved into a new building located on First Avenue South.  In 1954, Cameron was expanded to include a senior high school, fulfilling the community dream of a high school in South Nashville.  The following year an addition to the building provided needed facilities for the additional grades; in 1957 diplomas were issued to its first graduating class.
