<dc:title>Congregation Sherith Israel, 2001 March</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of Sherith Israel, an Orthodox synagogue in Nashville, Tennessee.  The first home for this congregation was in a member's home at 118 Fifth Avenue North, next to the Ryman.  In 1920, the building was razed, and a new Fifth Avenue structure was built.  Following the migration of Jews to the West End area, the Congregation bought the current property at 3600 West End Avenue and an adjacent lot in March 1948 and commenced construction of the current-day sanctuary. It was originally attached to an old mansion that housed administrative and educational departments.  In 1962, the mansion was torn down and a new structure housing the Akiva School, the Liff Auditorium, chapel, kitchen and offices was built. In 1971, the Congregation built the Alex and Marian Lucas chapel at the cemetery.  The foundation is stone and brick.  The exterior walls are red brick.  The roof is made of tar shingles.  The windows are a combination of stained and clear glass.  The doors are wood with  glass windows.  Other features include a wrap around front porch and a large stone seal with the ten commandments inscribed in Hebrew above the front door.  Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4  x 6  in.</dc:description>
