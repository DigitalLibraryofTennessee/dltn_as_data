<dc:title>Just before they soared away for U. S. War games, from the Nashville Times, 1940</dc:title>
<dc:description>A captioned photo from the Nashville Times (1940): &#8220;These formidable-looking Army planes, above, swooped down from the sky over Nashville to take on more gas and oil at Berry Field before striking out for McComb, Miss., on their way to Uncle Sam&#8217;s 1940 Southern Military Maneuvers in the Sabine River area of Louisiana and Texas. They are only a few of the 51 planes flying here from Selfridge Field, Mich., but they made an impressive spectacle. Fifteen of them were huge Douglas C-39 transport planes, hauling heavily-armed detachments of U. S. soldiers ready to participate in the war games. Twenty-seven of the planes were P-35 pursuiters which travelled the final 500 miles to Nashville in just two and a half hours--and weren&#8217;t in any great hurry, at that.&#8221; The P-35 was the first modern fighter, an all-metal pursuit plane with retractable landing gear and enclosed cockpit to go into regular service with the U. S. Army Air Corps. Forms part of the Nashville Times newspaper collection. 1 digital photo.</dc:description>
