<dc:title>Mansker&#8217;s First Fort historic marker, Goodlettsville, Tennessee, 1981 June </dc:title>
<dc:description>The Tennessee Historical Marker for Mansker&#8217;s First Fort that reads: 
&#8220;Here on west bank of the creek that he discovered in 1772, Kasper Mansker and other first settlers built a log fort in 1779.  John Donelson&#8217;s family fled here in 1780 for safety from Indians.  Mansker abandoned the fort in 1781 and moved to Fort Nashborough.  He returned in 1783, built a stronger stockade on east bank of the creek a half mile upstream, and lived there until he died in 1820.&#8221;  Mansker&#8217;s Station, also called Mansker&#8217;s Fort was a station along Avery&#8217;s Trace on the Cumberland Plateau between Knoxville and Nashville, Tennessee.  The marker can be found on Long Hollow Pike, between Cedar Street and Jackson Road in Goodlettsville, Tennessee.  Forms part of the Claynita Harris Slide Collection.  The original is a 35 mm color transparency (2 x 2 in. slide mount)
