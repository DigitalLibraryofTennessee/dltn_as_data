<dc:title>Greetings from Nashville, Tennessee, 1961</dc:title>
<dc:description>A postcard featuring two Nashville scenes.  The top section is of the Parthenon in Centennial Park.  The view shows the annual Christmas display which attracted thousands of visitors each year from 1954 to 1967.  In 1968 the oversized nativity scene was sold to a shopping center in Cincinnati because of the inability to make necessary repairs to the pieces.  The bottom photograph is of the Nashville city skyline showing the Life and Casualty Building towering above the City.  This building was once the tallest skyscraper in the south.  A "Greetings from Nashville, Tennessee" banner separates the two photographs.  Forms part of the Norton Postcard Collection. 1 postcard : col. ; 3.5  x 5.5  in.</dc:description>
