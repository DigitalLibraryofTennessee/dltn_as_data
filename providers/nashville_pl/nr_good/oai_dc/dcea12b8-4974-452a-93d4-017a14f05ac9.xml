<dc:description>A published article about the forthcoming construction of the Nashville Municipal Auditorium, from September 28th, 1959 issue of the Nashville Banner.  It reads: &#8220;Nashville&#8217;s $5,000,000 Municipal Auditorium, designed by Marr &amp; Holman, AIA architects, will soon begin to take shape where this temporary &#8216;lake&#8217; now stands.  Just beyond it is the area between the auditorium site and the new motel under construction on the Charlotte Ave. frontage, a 750-car parking garage is being constructed by the Nashville Parking Board.  This site is between Gay St. and Charlotte Ave.  James Robertson Blvd. curves to the left to meet the Victory Memorial Bridge.  Excavation for the auditorium is completed and excavation for the parking garage is under way.  Auditorium construction will begin as soon as the parking excavation is completed.--Banner Photo by Goodman.&#8221;  This facility, located at 417 4th Avenue N, opened in October of 1962.  The structure has three levels with a seat capacity approximately 10,000 people.  Forms part of Record Group 3. The original is a 35 mm color transparency (2 x 2 in. slide mount).</dc:description>
