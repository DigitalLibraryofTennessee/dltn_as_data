<dc:title>Photograph of the destruction of buildings on the east side of the Public Square in Nashville, Tennessee, 1974</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of the destruction of buildings on east side of the Public Square in Nashville, Tennessee. The square, with the county courthouse, city hall and market center, was a focus of wholesale commerce and political activity for the city for many years. The old city hall and the county courthouse buildings, dating from the 1850s, were replaced by a single building in 1937. Most of the remaining buildings were destroyed in the 1970s as part of urban renewal projects. The crane has already demolished 332 Public Square East, the site of Everett Beasley, Inc. The buildings at 338 Public Square East that formerly housed W. S. Riddle Notion Company, number 336 that had housed Sam Lapidus Dry Goods, and part of the building at 334, the former site of the Southern Coat and Dress Company and Golden Art Hosiery Company, are still standing in the picture. These structures were demolished in 1974 during the construction of the Gay Street connector. Photographed by the Nashville architect Charles Wesley Warterfield, Jr. (1926-1998); the architectural photograph forms part of the Charles Warterfield Architectural Collection. Gift of: The Estate of Charles W. Warterfield, Jr., F. A. I. A. The original is a 35 mm color transparency (2 x 2 in. slide mount)</dc:description>
