<dc:title>Proclamation of Jim Turner Day at Sulphur Dell ballpark, Nashville, Tennessee, 1953 April</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pictured: Jim Turner, the New York Yankees Pitching Coach, speaking at the microphone during the proclamation ceremony of Jim Turner Day, hosted at Sulphur Dell ballpark in Nashville, Tennessee circa April 1953.  In addition to Jim Turner, the honoree, the ceremony was attended by Tennessee Governor Frank Clement, Mayor Ben West, and others.  James Riley Turner (August 6, 1903 &#8211; November 29, 1998) was a pitcher and coach in Major League Baseball.  Turner, a native of Antioch, Tennessee, was known as &#8220;Milkman Jim&#8221; for working in his family's dairy business during the off seasons. Turner made his major league debut in 1937 with the Boston Braves, went on to pitch for the Yankees in relief, and finished his career as a pitching coach for the Yankees and the Reds.  Most notably, he was pitching coach for the New York Yankees under Casey Stengel from 1949 to 1959, during which time they won seven titles.  Turner also managed the Nashville Vols for one season in 1960.  Apart from his baseball career, Turner was a lifelong resident of Nashville, Tennessee.
