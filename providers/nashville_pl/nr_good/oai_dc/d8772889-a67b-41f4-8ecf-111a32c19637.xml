<dc:title>Nashville First Church of the Nazarene, 2001 January 04</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of Nashville First Church of the Nazarene located in East Nashville at 510 Woodland Street in Nashville, Tennessee.  This church was built in 1887 as the Woodland Street Presbyterian Church.  The edifice was severely damaged in the East Nashville fire of 1916 and was subsequently sold to the First Church of the Nazarene later that year.  This congregation initiated a rebuilding program and fully moved into the worship space the following year.  Soon the congregation acquired additional property on both sides of the building on which many additions have been built.  Extensive renovation and rebuilding has taken place during the years.  The style of the current church building is massive and modern.  The foundation is brick.  The exterior walls are brick.  The roof is asphalt shingle.  The windows are glass.  Additions to the building have been so numerous that it is difficult to identify the historic elements.  Special features include a steeple topped with a simple cross.  The church is the largest and oldest of the organized Nazarene churches in Nashville.  Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4  x 6  in.</dc:description>
