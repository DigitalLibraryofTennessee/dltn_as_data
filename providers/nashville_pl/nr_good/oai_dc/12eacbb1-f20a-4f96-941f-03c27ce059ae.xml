<dc:title>Bicentennial Capitol Mall and the Farmer&#8217;s Market, Nashville, Tennessee, 2016 March 20</dc:title>
<dc:description>The Nashville Farmer&#8217;s Market, pictured from the Bicentennial Capitol Mall park, Nashville, Tennessee, March 20th, 2016.  The park is within the Tennessee State Parks system.  The Farmer&#8217;s Market has been a vital part of Nashville life since its inception on the town square in the early 1800&#8217;s.  The market has had several homes and in the mid-1950&#8217;s the City moved the Farmers&#8217; Market to a new location just north of Downtown on Jefferson Street. In 1995, the Farmers&#8217; Market was renovated as part of the Bicentennial State Park Mall development. The Market now stretches from Harrison to Jackson Streets on Rosa L. Parks Blvd. and covers 16 acres of urban land.  Forms part of the Leanne Garland Photograph Collection.  1 digital photograph.  </dc:description>
