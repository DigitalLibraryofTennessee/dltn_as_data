<dc:title>North Edgefield Baptist Church</dc:title>
<dc:description>North Edgefield Baptist Church was organized in 1886.  The congregation dedicated this building at the corner of Treutland and Meridian Streets in 1892.  The first pastor was Thadius T. Thompson.  In the mid 1970's the congregation at North Edgefield merged with Maplewood Baptist to become Broadmoor Baptist and soon after moved to a new location.  In 1981 the property was sold to a group of Asian immigrants and became Nashville's first Buddhist temple.  The building has since been demolished. 8 x 10 in.</dc:description>
