<dc:title>New Bethel Baptist Church, 2002 January</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of New Bethel Baptist Church located at 1080 Old Dickerson Pike in Goodlettsville, Tennessee.  The congregation organized in 1794, two years before Tennessee became a state, six miles North of Nashville on White's Creek Pike.  The original name of the church was White's Creek Church, and it is believed to be the oldest Baptist church in Davidson County.  In 1837, the church moved to Old Center Meeting House on Dickerson Road in Goodlettsville.  In 1854 the church moved to its present location and changed the name to New Bethel Baptist Church.  The frame building that was constructed in 1854 was struck by lightning soon after.  A new church built in 1891 was destroyed by a tornado in 1923.  Another church was built in 1924 with lumber salvaged from the building hit by the tornado.  The current building was built in 1956.  The exterior walls are brick.  The roof is gabled.  The windows appear to be stained glass.  Double doors mark the entrance with four columns holding up the portico.  Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4  x 6  in.</dc:description>
