<dc:title>McKendrie, or First Methodist Church, circa 1859</dc:title>
<dc:description>A page from a mounted and bound volume of twenty-five pen-and-ink wash drawings, and two pen-and-ink maps of Nashville created by William A. Eichbaum during the 1850s.  Eichbaum was a Nashville bookseller and resident for fifty years.  The drawing on this page is of the first McKendree Methodist Church building.  Eichbaum's sketch is labeled with a misspelling of the church's name ('McKendrie').  This church was dedicated to Bishop McKendree upon completion in 1833.  This church served as the backdrop for many historic events during its time, from gubernatorial inaugurations, to presidential funeral processions.  In 1863 the church was taken over by the Federal Army, which had occupied Nashville, and was used as a hospital.  In 1876 the congregation had outgrown their church, and a new, larger edifice of Gothic architecture was erected on the same site.  Three years later that church was destroyed by fire.  Forms part of the William A. Eichbaum Sketchbook. 1 drawing : col. ; 5.75  x 9  in.</dc:description>
