He established Nashville&#8217;s first dry goods store by 1786, on a site 30 yards east.  The building, which served as store, tavern and dwelling, faced south and was known as &#8216;the house with a piazza.&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#8221;  This dry goods store was located in downtown Nashville at approximately the same location as the later Washington Manufacturing Company (214-216 Second Avenue).  Clark&#8217;s deed related to lot 11 which was in the block boundaries of Church, Second Avenue, Clark and First Avenue.  Forms part of the Claynita Harris Slide Collection.
