<dc:title>Letter from P.J. Williamson to his wife, Eunice, during the Civil War, 1864 October 10</dc:title>
<dc:description>A letter from Dutch immigrant, Peter J. Williamson, back home to his wife, Eunice, during the Civil War.  In 1862 Williamson enlisted as a Private in the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, Company F and was ultimately promoted to Full 1st Lieutenant.  During the war, Williamson's regiment was involved in scouting and raids in Missouri and Arkansas and saw battle in the Middle Tennessee, Chickamauga, and Atlanta campaigns. In this letter from Franklin, Tennessee, Williamson has returned from Nashville while his brigade is out chasing General Forrest.  He mentions that his time will most likely have expired before he gets back with his brigade.  He also discusses the government order regarding officers' discharges and promotions, using himself as an example.  He complains of being idle and of the boarding costs of staying in Franklin and Nashville.  He relates news and Confederate casualties from a battle in Cartersville and tells her it is the first battle that he has missed during the campaign.  He tells her he has sent some money and that he should be able to send more soon.  He briefly discusses going to church and the homesickness it inspires.  Williamson then speaks of traveling to Columbia, Tennessee, the next day and states that his orders provide him with free travel throughout the Department of the Cumberland.  He closes by telling her the nights are getting cold and asks her to think of him often.  Forms part of the Peter J. Williamson Letters. 1 letter : col. ; 8  x 10 in.</dc:description>
