<dc:title>Omohundro Water Filtration Plant, Nashville, Tennessee, n.d.</dc:title>
<dc:description>An undated photograph of the interior main entrance to the Omohundro Water Filtration Plant, of the Omohundro Water Filtration Complex District in Nashville, Tennessee, located at 1400 Pumping Station Road across the Cumberland River from Shelby Park. In 1987, the complex was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Filter Building was built in several phases starting in the 1920s in a basilica style plan. Originally steam-powered, it is now powered by electricity. This image shows the Terrazzo tile floor laid in an alternating diamond pattern, gray marble control stations, and arched brick galleries that illustrate the impressive architecture used in buildings throughout the complex. Water filters and their controls are lined up on both the left and right. Photographed by the Nashville architect Charles Wesley Warterfield, Jr. (1926-1998); the architectural photograph forms part of the Charles Warterfield Architectural Collection. Gift of: The Estate of Charles W. Warterfield, Jr., F. A. I. A. The original is a 35 mm color transparency (2 x 2 in. slide mount).</dc:description>
