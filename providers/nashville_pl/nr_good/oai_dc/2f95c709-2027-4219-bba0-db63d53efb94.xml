<dc:description>An exterior view of the Post Office and U.S. Customs House, located at 701 Broadway, Nashville, Tennessee, circa 1904.  This grand Victorian Gothic-styled structure originated with legislative approval for a federal building in Nashville circa 1856.  The construction was delayed until after the Civil War.  In 1877, President Rutherford B. Hayes laid its cornerstone.  The original structure was first designed by Treasury architect William A. Potter.  The rear addition was designed by James Knox Taylor, circa 1903.  Circa 1916, flanking wings were added to the structure, designed by James A. Wetmore.  Forms part of Glimpses of Nashville. 1 booklet </dc:description>
