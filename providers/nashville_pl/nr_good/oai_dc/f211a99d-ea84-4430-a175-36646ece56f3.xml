<dc:title>Two Rivers Mansion, the David H. McGavock House, circa 1978</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of the Two Rivers Mansion, located at 3130 McGavock Pike, approximately 11 miles from downtown Nashville, Tennessee, as it appeared circa 1978. Two Rivers Mansion was constructed in 1859 for David H. McGavock and his wife William "Willie" Elizabeth Harding (so named for both of her parents) and is one of the earliest of the Italianate style structures in Middle Tennessee. It was the second home to be erected on the Two Rivers Farm, located at the junction of the Stones and Cumberland rivers. This mansion and surrounding tract is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. William Harding, David H. McGavock's father-in-law, was the original owner of the first mansion. Two Rivers Mansion and its surrounding acreage were purchased by the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County in 1966 from the estate of Mary Louise Bransford McGavock. Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph : b &amp; w ; 5 x 7 in.</dc:description>
