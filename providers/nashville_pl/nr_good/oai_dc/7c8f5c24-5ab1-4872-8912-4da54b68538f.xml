This photograph of Mrs. E. G. Buford, President, appears in the school's 1912 yearbook "The Mirror." Elizabeth Burgess Buford was born in Cornersville, Marshall County, Tennessee, a daughter of J. J.

The campus was located west of Franklin Road, near the intersection of Caldwell Lane and General Bate Drive, near Buford Place. The yearbooks describe the acreage as "a magnificent highland park of 25 acres, surrounded by an 85 acre woodland, with springs, wells, and a cistern, upon a fine electric car line." The enrollment was limited to 100 girls between the ages of 16 and 20. The college subsequently relocated twice more in Davidson County. At age 71, Elizabeth Buford, the president of Buford College, passed away on February 12th, 1920, and was buried next to her husband at their grand tombstone at Mount Olivet Cemetery.
