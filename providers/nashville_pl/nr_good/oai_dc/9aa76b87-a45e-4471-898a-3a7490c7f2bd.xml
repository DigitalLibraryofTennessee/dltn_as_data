<dc:title>Sam Davis Home, Smyrna, Tenn., Flower Garden, Sam Davis Monument, circa 1910</dc:title>
<dc:description>A postcard of the Sam Davis Home, located in Smyrna, Tennessee. This two-story home is the site where Sam Davis (1842-1863), "the Boy Hero of the Confederacy" grew up, he being the oldest son of Charles Lewis and Jane Simmons Davis. The home was built along the banks of Stewarts Creek circa 1810 by Moses Ridley and then renovated by the Davis Family about mid-century. Sam Davis, like many other young men, joined the army before Tennessee had officially seceded from the Union. Early in 1863, Sam became a member of "Coleman's Scouts," working behind enemy lines and gathering information about Federal troop movement. Around November 20, 1863 as Sam traveled toward Chattanooga, he was captured by Federal troops near Minor Hill, Tennessee and tried by court-martial on charges of spying and carrying mails to persons in arms against the United States. Davis refused to reveal the source of his information and was hanged near Pulaski, Tennessee on November 27, 1863. The Sam Davis Home was acquired by the State of Tennessee from the Davis Family circa 1927, becoming an historic house museum and a shrine to Davis, who is buried there in the family cemetery. The Sam Davis Home is carefully maintained and administered as a memorial to the Confederate hero by the Sam Davis Memorial Association. Forms part of the Nashville Room Postcard Collection. 1 postcard : col. ; 3.5  x 5.5  in.</dc:description>
