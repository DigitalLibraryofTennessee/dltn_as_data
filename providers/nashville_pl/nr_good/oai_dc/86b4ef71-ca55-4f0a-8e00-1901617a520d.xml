<dc:title>Photograph of puppeteer Tom Tichenor and a Nashville Public Library's Children's Division display, 1963</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of puppeteer and stage designer Tom Tichenor at the Nashville Public Library's Children's Division storytelling display on July 22, 1963. Tichenor began his career as a puppeteer when he was an elementary school student at Tarbox School in Nashville, Tennessee. In 1938, while attending Hume-Fogg High School, Tichenor staged a production of Puss in Boots for the Children's Division of the Nashville Public Library Main Library, beginning a fifty-year relationship with the children of Nashville. At his retirement from the Library in 1988, he donated many of his original marionettes and puppets to continue the legacy of bringing the world of puppetry to children. Photographed by Milton McClurkan. Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph : b &amp; w ; 8 x 10 in.</dc:description>
