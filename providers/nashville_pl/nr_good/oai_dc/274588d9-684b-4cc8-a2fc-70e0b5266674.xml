<dc:title>Carol choir, circa 1955</dc:title>
<dc:description>This photograph, published in the Nashville Banner circa the Yuletide season of 1955, relates to a Nashville family's long and meaningful participation in the Christmas carol program of the Fannie Battle Day Home. The caption from an undated clipping in the scrapbook reads: "Typical of the scores of Nashville families in which the tradition of singing carols on Christmas Eve for the Fannie Battle Social Workers is an annual practice, is the three-generation picture of Mrs. James W. Perkins, her daughter, Mrs. J.N. Stafford, and her three young daughters, who this year will be members of choirs.  At the fireplace of the Perkins home on Saratoga Drive practicing for their part which will bring the true joy of the Yuletide season to many home, from left, are, front row, Neill, Ellen and Susan Stafford; back row, Mrs. Perkins and Mrs. Stafford.  Mrs. Stafford and Mrs. Perkins, both members of the Fannie Battle Social Workers, whose Day Home benefits from this annual Christmas project, have lent their support to the carol program for many years. This year Mrs. Stafford is clearance chairman." Forms part of the Fannie Battle Day Home Records. 1 photograph : b &amp; w ; 7.5 x 9.25 in.</dc:description>
