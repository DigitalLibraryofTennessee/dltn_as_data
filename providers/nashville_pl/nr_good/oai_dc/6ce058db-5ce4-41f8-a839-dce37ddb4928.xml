<dc:title>Photograph of the Young Moderns Den of the Nashville Public Library, circa 1960</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of the Young Moderns Den of the Nashville Public Library, circa 1960. The young adults are making use of the educational and entertainment resources, while one couple dances to the sounds of a phonograph. The Young Moderns Den was located in the basement of the library. The public library building was constructed with a $100,000 grant from philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, and the cornerstone was laid on April 27, 1903. Officially opened to the public on September 19, 1904, the building was located at 8th Avenue North and Union Street. The Carnegie Library of Nashville was renamed the Nashville Public Library in 1934, being active at this location until 1963, when the new Metropolitan Government began construction on a new main library upon the site. Photographed by Wiles-Hood. Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph : b &amp; w ; 8 x 10 in.</dc:description>
