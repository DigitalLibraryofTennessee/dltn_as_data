<dc:title>Salvage scrap drive in Nashville and Middle Tennessee region, 1942 October</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pictured: &#8220;Vanderbilt University adds campus fences to Banner scrap pile: realizing the vital need for scrap iron by the Government, Vanderbilt University officials today &#8220;gave a fence for Allied offense&#8221; as they authorized the scrapping of the iron railings which border the campus along West End Avenue and Twenty-first Avenue, South.  Workmen are pictured as they began the dismantling of the family boundary rails erected in 1900.  Witnessing the first scrapping operations are (at left) A. E. Ayers, assistant building supervisor of the university, and Gerald Henderson, Vanderbilt business manager; (at right) Dr. George Mayfield; professor of German at Vanderbilt and resident of the campus for more than 35 years; and F. L. Reeves, university building custodian.  The scrapping of the railings is being supervised by E. E. Bryan, superintendent of buildings and power plant at the school.&#8221; During World War II Americans were active with scrap drives to help the war effort.  Local communities were salvaging raw materials such as metal, rags, rubber, and paper to be used to supply troops.  These special home front war programs were often well-coordinated through committees that engaged widespread urban and rural participation and motivated patriotism and community spirit.  Forms part of Record Group 412, Photographs Collection. 1 photograph negative : b &amp; w ; 4 x 5 in.
