<dc:title>Silhouettes of a young woman by artist Ortho Barden, circa 1937</dc:title>
<dc:description>Two silhouette profiles of a young woman, by Otho Barden, an eminent silhouette artist, circa 1937.  Silhouettes were often made in a children&#8217;s shop or a department store and typically based on the likeness of the profiles. This art form was also commonly done in resort areas so the visitor could mail it home to friends and family.  These silhouettes were sentimental keepsakes from the collection of Katherine Sparks.  Katherine Josephine Sparks was born in Nashville, Tennessee in 1910 to attorney Jesse W. Sparks, Jr. (1867-1953) and Lucile Satterwhite Sparks (1883-1972).   Forms part of the Katherine Sparks Collection.  2 items.
