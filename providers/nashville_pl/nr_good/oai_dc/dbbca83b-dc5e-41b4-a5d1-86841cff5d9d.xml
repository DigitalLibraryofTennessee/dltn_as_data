Sulphur Dell was the home of the Nashville Vols in the Southern Association from 1901 until 1961 and in the South Atlantic League in 1963.  According to the Sulphur Dell historical marker: &#8220;Nashville&#8217;s first (1885) professional baseball was played in the Athletic Park which formerly occupied this block.  Traditionally baseball was introduced in Nashville in 1862 by soldiers of the Union army of occupation who played the game here.
