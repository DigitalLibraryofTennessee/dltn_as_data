<dc:title>Burton Hills residence, known earlier as the Felix Compton home "Seven Hills" in Nashville, Tennessee, circa 1973</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of the old Felix Compton house, located at the northeast corner of Hillsboro Road and Harding Place in Nashville, Tennessee, 5050 Hillsboro Road (Hillsboro Pike), when it was the A.M Burton family residence, circa 1973. This colonial-styled house was built in the 1840s, incorporating a portion of an earlier John Lucas home with its heavy timber walls. Felix Compton purchased the home circa 1858 and by 1860 he owned 750 acres. During the Civil War, Battle of Nashville, December 15-16, 1864 and days after the battle, it was used by both sides as a hospital. The house has been called "Seven Hills" because of its setting. The Compton family continued to live there until circa 1905. In 1929, A.M. Burton bought the property and it was a Burton home until circa 1981. Mr. and Mr. A.M. Burton had deeded the house to David Lipscomb College, which sold it to a Nashville developer. An article in the Nashville Banner (Sept. 19, 1984) cites reference to the dismantling and relocation of the structure to Dickson County, Tennessee. Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph : b &amp; w ; 5 x 7 in.</dc:description>
