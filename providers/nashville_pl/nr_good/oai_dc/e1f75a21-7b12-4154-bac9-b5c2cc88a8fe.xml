<dc:title>Joseph Avenue Church of Christ, 2002 January</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of Joseph Avenue Church of Christ located at 1201 Joseph Avenue in Nashville, Tennessee.  The church first appears in the city directory in 1926.  In 1977 the name changed to New Joseph Avenue Church of Christ.  In 1980 the name changed again to Northeast Church of Christ.  Since 2001 the church has been listed in the city directory as Nashville Inner City Ministry.  The foundation is made of rough cut stone blocks that have been painted tan.  The exterior walls are made of brick.  The roof is flat.  The windows have been boarded up, but appear to have originally been tall and thin.  The doors are made of wood.  An awning hangs above the entrance.  A cement staircase leads up to the front doors.  Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4  x 6  in.</dc:description>
