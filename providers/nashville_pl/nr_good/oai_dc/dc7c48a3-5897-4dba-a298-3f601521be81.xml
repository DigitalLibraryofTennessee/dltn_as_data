<dc:title>Letter from P.J. Williamson to his wife, Eunice, during the Civil War, 1863 October 13</dc:title>
<dc:description>A letter from Dutch immigrant, Peter J. Williamson, back home to his wife, Eunice, during the Civil War.  In 1862 Williamson enlisted as a Private in the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, Company F and was ultimately promoted to Full 1st Lieutenant.  During the war, Williamson's regiment was involved in scouting and raids in Missouri and Arkansas and saw battle in the Middle Tennessee, Chickamauga, and Atlanta campaigns. In this letter from Bridgeport, Alabama, Williamson gives an account of an engagement in response to General Wheeler's October 1863 raid and describes the pursuit of rebel forces including a skirmish in Shelbyville.  He provides a description of how the Army is fairing in Bridgeport and states that General Howard and General Schurz are present there.  He mentions an encounter with General Schurz and his staff whom he describes as being "all Germans".  He tells her of the corn and other forage scarcity in his area and shares a "considerable" story of twenty foot high stalks of corn near Chattanooga.  He speaks of the camaraderie in the camp and tells her he cannot give assurances about coming to Wisconsin while the regiment is away.  Williamson then provides a description of Lookout Mountain, Chattanooga and the railroads of the region.  He further states that the African American population has been removed to the interior of Georgia and South Carolina and the general population is in very poor condition.  He thanks God for his health and from death on the battlefield and speaks of her sacrifice due to his absence.  He closes by asking her to give his respects to their friends and family.  Forms part of the Peter J. Williamson Letters. 1 letter : col. ; 8 x 10 in.</dc:description>
