<dc:title>Patterson Forge, or Montgomery Bell Tunnel, Cheatham County, Tennessee, 1977 August </dc:title>
<dc:description>A view of the water tunnel in Cheatham County known as Patterson&#8217;s Forge, or Montgomery Bell Tunnel.  The historic marker near the tunnel describes the site as &#8220;4.1 mi. northwest, at The Narrows, Montgomery Bell, pioneer industrialist, ironmaster, philanthropist and turfman, built a forge in 1818.  Power was obtained by tunneling water through the hill at the top of the Narrows to a point below it where the river returns after making a 7-mile horseshoe bend.&#8221; It is around 290 foot long through limestone rock which was the first &#8220;full-scale&#8221; water diversion tunnel built in the United States.  The site is a part of the Narrows of the Harpeth State Historic Area maintained by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation.  It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1994.  Forms part of the Claynita Harris Slide Collection.  The original is a 35 mm color transparency (2 x 2 in. slide mount) </dc:description>
