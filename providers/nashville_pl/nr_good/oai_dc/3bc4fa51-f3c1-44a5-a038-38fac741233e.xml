<dc:description>Wharton School was named for Arthur Dickson Wharton who served as principal and professor at various Nashville schools. According to Annual Reports of the Public Schools of Nashville, Tennessee, Wharton school had been occupied for one year at the close of the 1905-1906 school year. At that time, the building was unfinished but was completed in the next couple of years. The original school building housed grades one through four, and W.J. Myers was listed as principal during the school's first year. A new building was built in 1959 on Eighteenth Avenue North. 11 x 14 in.</dc:description>
