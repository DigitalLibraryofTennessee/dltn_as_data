<dc:title>Salvage scrap drive in Nashville and Middle Tennessee region, 1942 October</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pictured: &#8220; Wrought iron gates on way to scrap pile: these picturesque iron gates and another pair just like them, located on the old Keith estate on Harding Road, now owned by Abe Olshine, will shortly be made into less ornate but more emphatic weapons of war.  Olshine today donated the gates to the Banner scrap drive, at the same time urging other owners of old wrought iron portals, fences, etc., to do the same.  Tom Springfield, chairman of the Davidson County Salvage Committee, is shown inspecting the heavy iron gates before they are unhinged and hauled to the county scrap pile.&#8221;  During World War II Americans were active with scrap drives to help the war effort.  Local communities were salvaging raw materials such as metal, rags, rubber, and paper to be used to supply troops.  These special home front war programs were often well-coordinated through committees that engaged widespread urban and rural participation and motivated patriotism and community spirit.
