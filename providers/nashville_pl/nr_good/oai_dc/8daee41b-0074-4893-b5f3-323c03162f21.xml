<dc:title>New Hall Intermediaries, 2001 January 04</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of New Hall Intermediaries, an insurance office, located at 1230 Second Avenue South in Nashville, Tennessee.  This building was constructed in 1873 by Morton Howell after he purchased the lot on Market Street (now Second Avenue).  Morton Howell served as Nashville's mayor from 1874-1875.  He lived in this home from the time it was built until his death in 1909.  From 1912-1918 the city directories list the address as occupied by an L.G. Tate.  From 1919-1922 the address is listed as vacant.  From 1922 until 1928 it is listed as the Nashville Private Maternity Hospital, changing again in 1929 to the Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity House.  Serving as the fraternity house for only one year, the city directory next lists it as a residence for Mrs. A. Letty Sweeny in 1930.  In 1933 it is listed as the Nashville Funeral Parlor.  In 1940 it became the Apostolic Faith Mission, tweaking its name to the Apostolic Faith and Home Mission in 1949.  From 1973 until 1980 the building is listed as being vacant.  From 1981 until 1987 it is listed as being under construction, but then goes back to the vacant listing until 1997.  Finally in 1998 an insurance company called New Hall Intermediaries moved in.  The address is currently listed in the city directory as being occupied by four lawyers.  The architecture is that of the Second Empire style.  The foundation is stone on the sides and concrete on the front.  The exterior walls are brick.  The roof is made of asphalt shingles.  The windows are plain glass and appear to have been replaced during renovation.  The doors are wooden.  On the front door there is a reproduction of a stained glass panel.  Special features include an original historic staircase and large pocket doors as well as original molding around the doors and windows.  The third story was added after the roof burned off several years ago.  This building was a recipient of the Metro Historic Commission Architectural Award.  Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4  x 6  in.</dc:description>
