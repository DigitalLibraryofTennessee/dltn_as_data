<dc:title>Nashville in 1804, circa 1859</dc:title>
<dc:description>A page from a mounted and bound volume of twenty-five pen-and-ink wash drawings, and two pen-and-ink maps of Nashville created by William A. Eichbaum during the 1850s.  Eichbaum was a Nashville bookseller and resident for fifty years.  The map on this page shows Nashville as it was in 1804.  Each prominent building structure is assigned a number.  Each number is then assigned to its corresponding building name in a key located at the bottom of the map.  Eichbaum also lightly noted some present day streets as they were at the time of the creation of the map, presumably to give viewers some current reference points.  Some of the referenced buildings include Talbot Tavern, Old Stone Tavern, the Court House, and various stores and guesthouses.  Forms part of the William A. Eichbaum Sketchbook. 1 drawing : col. ; 5.75  x 9  in.</dc:description>
