<dc:title>Letter from P.J. Williamson to his wife, Eunice, 1869 September 20</dc:title>
<dc:description>A letter from Dutch immigrant, Peter J. Williamson, to his wife, Eunice, in the years following the Civil War.  In 1862 Williamson enlisted as a Private in the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, Company F and was ultimately promoted to Full 1st Lieutenant.  During the war, Williamson's regiment was involved in scouting and raids in Missouri and Arkansas and saw battle in the Middle Tennessee, Chickamauga, and Atlanta campaigns. After the war, he and his family settled in Nashville and he became an architect.  In this letter from Nashville, Tennessee, Williamson reports that he and their children are well but miss her.  He relates witnessing a fire at Andrew Anderson's Foundry on Cherry Street near Broad Street in Nashville the night before.  He mentions how often they write and her trip to San Bernardino including the poor postal service there.  He then discusses a couple of personal issues between them including the issue of her staying longer and her being missed greatly.  Williamson tells Eunice he will not be able to visit her and that he is grateful for the San Jose newspaper he received from William.  He closes by expressing his pleasure at her improving health and sends his respects to their family there.  Forms part of the Peter J. Williamson Letters. 1 letter : col. ; 8 x 10 in.</dc:description>
