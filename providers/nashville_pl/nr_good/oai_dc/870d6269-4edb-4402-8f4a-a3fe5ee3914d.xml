<dc:description>Mayor Ben West and the first flight of the Eastern Airlines Constellation airliner at the Nashville Airport on April 26th, 1953.  The aircraft was manufactured by Lockheed and represented the ultimate in airline performance and luxury during the 1950s.  Nashville's airport officially opened in 1937 as Berry Field, in honor of Colonel Harry S. Berry, the state administrator of the Works Progress Administrator, or WPA. Berry Field became the military base for the 4th Ferrying Command during World War II and was returned to the city when the war ended. The airport&#8217;s name was officially changed to Nashville International Airport in 1988, but the original three-letters BNA, which stands for Berry Field Nashville, remains.
