<dc:title>Tennessee Governor's Mansion on West End Avenue, Nashville, Tennessee, n.d.</dc:title>
<dc:description>An undated photograph of the second governor's mansion located at 2118 West End Avenue, Nashville, Tennessee. The squarish, buff-colored brick structure was originally a residence built by C. T. Cheek, a wealthy wholesale grocer, circa 1910. It was noted for its leaded glass doors and windows and its handsome Palladian dormer window. The state first rented and then purchased the property in 1923. This mansion housed governors Alf Taylor, Austin Peay, Henry Horton, Hill McAlister, Gordon Browning, Prentice Cooper and Jim McCord from 1921 to 1949. Jim Nance McCord was the last governor to live in the executive mansion. The old edifice soon became in need of multiple repairs in an area that was "going commercial." The structure was razed circa June 1979 to make way for a fried chicken restaurant (Popeye's Famous Fried Chicken). Photographed by the Nashville architect Charles Wesley Warterfield, Jr. (1926-1998); the architectural photograph forms part of the Charles Warterfield Architectural Collection. Gift of: The Estate of Charles W. Warterfield, Jr., F. A. I. A. The original is a 35 mm color transparency (2 x 2 in. slide mount).</dc:description>
