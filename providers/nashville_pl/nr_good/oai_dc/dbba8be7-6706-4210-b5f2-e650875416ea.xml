<dc:title>Dedication in remembrance of Mary Miller Blanton, &#8220;The Iris,&#8221; Ward&#8217;s Seminary for Young Ladies, Nashville, Tennessee, 1902 </dc:title>
<dc:description>A dedication in remembrance of Mary Miller Blanton, published in the Ward&#8217;s Seminary for Young Ladies yearbook of 1902.  This prestigious school for girls was founded in 1865 by Dr. William E. Ward, a Presbyterian Minister and his wife, Eliza Hudson Ward. The school was located at 15 South Spruce Street (Eighth Avenue) in Nashville, Tennessee, next to the Savage House, a townhouse in downtown Nashville. Pictured at the entranceway are some of the students, faculty, and Reverend Ward. The school was regarded as one of the leading schools for young women in the South. It offered training in fine arts and the "refinement of young ladies" in addition to its preparatory and collegiate curriculum. Reverend Ward directed the school until his death in 1887, after which it continued to operate for several years. On June 1, 1913, Ward's Seminary and Belmont College for Young Women merged and chartered Ward-Belmont, the first junior college in the South to receive full accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools.  Forms part of the Christine Webb Collection. 1 yearbook.
