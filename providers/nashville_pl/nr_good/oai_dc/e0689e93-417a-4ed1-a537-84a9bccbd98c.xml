<dc:title>Reminiscences of Roy C. Avery, 1971 June</dc:title>
<dc:description>Excerpts from the reminiscences of Roy C. Avery, recorded in June 1971 by Catherine Berry Pilcher Avery and Rev. William Dixon Gray.  The recording is part of the Century III Nashville:  Nashville Heritage Project.  Avery recalls the boredom and routine of everyday life in the Army during World War I; sailing across the Atlantic Ocean for service in France on board the Cunard ship Olympic; and getting promoted to first lieutenant and having to have his new uniform made by a French tailor, with humorous results.  The complete interview, as well as an index, is available in the Special Collections Division.  The complete interview, as well as a complete transcript and Avery's World War I diary, is available online via the Library of Congress Veterans History Project at http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/vhp/story/loc.natlib.afc2001001.00436/.</dc:description>
