<dc:title>Vocalist, songwriter Hank Fort, circa 1950 October 18</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of Mrs. Eleanor Hankins (Hank) Fort, a Nashville native and prominent singer-songwriter. Popularly known by the stage name of Hank Fort, her music included songs with a Southern flavor, such as: "Put Your Shoes on Lucy," "Nashville's Such a Friendly Place," "Save Your Confederate Money Boys," (the song that made her famous and was co-written with Larry Marks), and "My Favorite Friend." Her father was the distinguished southern portrait painter, Cornelius Hankins, famous for his wheat fields. Her mother, Maude McGehee Hankins, was also an artist and a writer of Children's verse. She attended George Peabody and Ward-Belmont Colleges. At the height of her popularity in Nashville, she began working and writing songs in the presidential campaign of Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee. In 1960, at the invitation of Lady Bird Johnson, she joined the flying tea parties, which were part of the campaign for the Kennedy-Johnson ticket.  Hank Fort's 1960 LP record "My Favorite Friend," was pressed at Standard Record Pressing Company, 415 Fourth Avenue, South, with the singing debut of Hank's husband, William E. McCauliffe, a Washington investment broker. The couple resided in Washington, D.C. and their apartment was a favorite rendezvous for entertaining friends and politicians. Originally from the Nashville Banner newspaper. Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph : b &amp; w ; 8 x 10 in. (condition note: the original photo has a cropped portion on the bottom left side).</dc:description>
