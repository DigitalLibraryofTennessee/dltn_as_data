<dc:title>Woodland Street Bridge dedication, Nashville, Tennessee, circa 1966 December</dc:title>
<dc:description>A scene from the dedicatory address at the opening ceremony of the Woodland Street Bridge in Nashville, Tennessee.  During the address Mayor Briley recalled the history of the original Woodland street bridge constructed in the 19th century that had served the horse and buggy traffic of Nashville and Davidson County.  Fifth District Congressman Richard Fulton and Colonel Jesse Fishback, District Engineer of the Corps of Engineers, joined Mayor Briley in a ribbon cutting ceremony, along with Senator Albert Gore.  Mr. John Bransford, President of the Nashville Area Chamber of Commerce, presided at the ceremony and spoke of the increase in business in the future with the opening of a new traffic artery into the city.  Colonel Fishback remarked that the new bridge was an excellent example of the cooperation between federal and local governments in the planning and funding of a project.  Colonel Gilbert Dorland, President of the Nashville Bridge Company, represented the Cumberland River Development Association at the ceremony.
