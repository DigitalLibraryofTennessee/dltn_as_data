<dc:title>Photograph of the east side of the Public Square in Nashville, Tennessee, 1959</dc:title>
<dc:description>W. S. Riddle Notion Company, Sam Lapidus Clothing Company, Southern Coat and Dress Company, Golden Art Hosiery, and Everett Beasley Inc. were among the buildings that once delineated the outer perimeter of the public square in Nashville, Tennessee. The square, with the county courthouse, city hall and market center, was a focus of wholesale commerce and political activity for the city for many years. The old city hall, dating from the 1850s, was replaced by a new city hall and courthouse in 1937. Most of the remaining buildings were destroyed in the 1970s as part of urban renewal projects. These buildings, at 332-338 Public Square E., formed part of the east side of the square, facing the court house with their backs to the Cumberland River. The structures were demolished in 1974 during the construction of the Gay Street connector. Photographed by the Nashville architect Charles Wesley Warterfield, Jr. (1926-1998); the architectural photograph forms part of the Charles Warterfield Architectural Collection. Gift of: The Estate of Charles W. Warterfield, Jr., F. A. I. A. The original is a 35 mm color transparency (2 x 2 in. slide mount)</dc:description>
