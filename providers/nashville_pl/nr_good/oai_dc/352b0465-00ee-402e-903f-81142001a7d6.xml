<dc:title>Oral history interview with Mary Diane Maynard Ross, 2006 October 02</dc:title>
<dc:description>Excerpts from an oral history interview with Mary Diane Maynard Ross, conducted on 2 Oct. 2006 by Linda Barnickel as part of the Nashville Public Library's Veterans History Project.  Ross discusses the difficulty of leaving behind her young daughter  when she was deployed to the Persian Gulf during Operation Desert Shield; her concern about her daughter viewing television news, and the emotional impact of receiving a letter from her daughter written in cursive, which meant she was a "big girl" now; the type of uniform and clothing worn during her service in the Persian Gulf; the steps she took before she was sent overseas to prepare herself for her duties as a medic, the likelihood of losing one of her own soldiers, and what it was like when that happened, including coping strategies both at the time and since then; what it was like upon her return from overseas, including her pride in serving with the 101st Airborne  (Air Assault) Division and being awarded the Combat Medics Badge - one of very few women to receive this honor; and being dropped with her platoon on an airstrip in Iraq during Operation Desert Storm, surrounded by Bedouins, and without any infantry support whatsoever.  The complete interview is available in the repository.</dc:description>
