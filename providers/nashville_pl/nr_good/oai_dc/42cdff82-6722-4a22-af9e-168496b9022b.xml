<dc:title>These men guard pharmacy laws of state, from the Nashville Times, 1940</dc:title>
<dc:description>A captioned photo from the Nashville Times (1940), about the Pharmacy business. The caption reads: &#8220;When your prescription is sent to the drugstore it&#8217;s a pretty safe bet that the man who fills it knows his business because he&#8217;s had to take a pretty stiff examination supervised by the above members of the Tennessee Board of Pharmacy. Above, left to right, are: Allen F. Tay.lor, president, Elizabeth; Phil Vance, vice-president, Chattanooga; Robert Walker, secretary, Nashville; Tom Turner, past president, Henning; and Eugene W. Wright, past president, Memphis. The Board is meeting here in connection with the state meeting of the Tennessee Pharmaceutics Association.&#8221; Forms part of the Nashville Times newspaper collection. 1 digital photo.</dc:description>
