<dc:title>Business Branch of the Carnegie Library of Nashville, between 1931 and 1937</dc:title>
<dc:description>An interior view of the Business Branch of the Carnegie Library, Nashville, Tennessee. This business library was created to serve the industrial and business interests of Nashville and was generously supported through a gift of H. G. Hill, a prominent businessman. The library branch officially opened on March 20, 1931 and was established in the Nashville Chamber of Commerce Building, located at 315 Fourth Avenue, North. The Business Branch was later moved to the Main Library building in 1937, it having outgrown its space in its original location. Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph : b &amp; w ; 7.5 x 10 in.</dc:description>
