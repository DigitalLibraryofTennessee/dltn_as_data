<dc:title>Nashville City Schools, Fall School</dc:title>
<dc:description>Located on the corner of 8th Avenue South and Chestnut Street, Fall school was named for Philip Slater Fall, a prominent Nashville businessman and member of the Board of Education from 1865-1867. Since the school had no bell, a flag was put out in each 



front fence corner to signal that school was open. Fall school was built in 1898 and was in continuous use until a merger in 1970 when it became Fall-Hamilton Elementary, currently located on Wedgewood Avenue. The school is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
