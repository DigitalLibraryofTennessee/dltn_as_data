<dc:title>Photograph of the Drouillard Mansion in Nashville, Tennessee, circa 1960</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of the Drouillard Mansion, located at the corner of Vauxhall (Ninth Avenue) and Demonbreun Streets, in Nashville, Tennessee. Originally a red brick mansion built circa 1886, it was the residence of James Pierre Drouillard and wife Mary Florence Kirkman Drouillard (1843-1905). Mary Florence was a tremendously wealthy southern belle, who shocked Nashville society when she married a Union officer stationed in Nashville during the "enemy" occupation of Nashville in the midst of the Civil War. Following the war, the couple built an Italianate style mansion in Dickson County, Tennessee, within the historical iron furnace region of Cumberland Furnace, a place associated with Mary Florence's grandfather Anthony Wayne Van Leer, a prominent builder of an iron empire in Tennessee. By 1886, the Drouillards returned to Nashville to live at their newly built Victorian-styled mansion. In the 1920's the building became an apartment boarding house and later housed a Nashville chapter of the Knights of Columbus. The building was demolished in the early 1960s. Photographed by the Nashville architect Charles Wesley Warterfield, Jr. (1926-1998); the architectural photograph forms part of the Charles Warterfield Architectural Collection. Gift of: The Estate of Charles W. Warterfield, Jr., F. A. I. A. The original is a 35 mm color transparency (2 x 2 in. slide mount)</dc:description>
