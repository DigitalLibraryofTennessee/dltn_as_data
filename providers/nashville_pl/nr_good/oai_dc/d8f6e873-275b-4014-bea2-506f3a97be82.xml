<dc:title>Friendship Missionary Baptist Church, 2001 March</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of Friendship Missionary Baptist Church located at 1703 Jo Johnston Avenue in Nashville, Tennessee.  After this photograph was taken, the church acquired a new building at 2800 Buena Vista Pike.  Both buildings are used today.  The church's previous building was located on Division Street until the early 1950s when it moved to Jo Johnston Avenue.  The site on Jo Johnston Avenue used to belong to Jo Johnston Avenue Christian Church, a church that served a predominately white community.  As the social climate began to change, the neighborhood became populated by African Americans and a need for an African American church arose.   Today, the building houses the Friendship Community Outreach Center, an independent, non-profit organization offering programs for the youth in the community. The building has a stone foundation.  The exterior walls are brick.  The roof is comprised of asphalt shingles.  The windows are stained glass and covered with plexi-glass.  The doors are plate glass.  Some windows are boarded up.  Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4  x 6  in.</dc:description>
