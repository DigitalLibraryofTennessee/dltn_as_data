<dc:title>Golf and Country Club, Nashville, Tenn., circa 1908</dc:title>
<dc:description>A color postcard of the Golf and Country Club in Nashville, Tennessee.  The first nine holes were completed by the summer of 1901.  Fields were cut by mule-drawn mowers to prepare for the holes.  The first clubhouse, as seen on the postcard, was completed in 1902 and was situated on top of a small hill that looked north to the Richland Turnpike (now West End Avenue).  Today, West End Middle School sits in its place.  A road known then as Golf Club Lane connected the turnpike to the clubhouse; today, it is known as Bowling Avenue.  Membership was originally limited to 200.  Forms part of the Nashville Room Postcard Collection. 1 postcard : col. ; 3.5  x 5.5  in.</dc:description>
