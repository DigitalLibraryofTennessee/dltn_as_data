<dc:title>Peabody Normal College, Nashville, circa 1906</dc:title>
<dc:description>A postcard of Peabody Normal College, an outgrowth of the declining literary department of the University of Nashville on Second Avenue.  In 1874 Barnas Sears, Peabody Education Fund administrator, offered $6,000 annually if the University of Nashville would donate land and buildings for a normal school. Relieved from spending state funds, the legislature amended the University of Nashville's charter to establish the State Normal School, officially changing the name in 1875 before changing it again in 1889 to Peabody Normal College.  The College continued as a leading American normal school until 1909 when, in an effort to create a major Southern teachers' college, the grounds and buildings of the Peabody Normal School were donated to the George Peabody College for Teachers.  Forms part of the Nashville Room Postcard Collection. 1 postcard : col. ; 3.5  x 5.5  in.</dc:description>
