<dc:title>Photograph of the east side of Second Avenue North at the intersection with Commerce Street, circa 1994</dc:title>
<dc:description>A color image circa 1994 of the intersection of Commerce St. and Second Avenue North. This image was taken from the southwest corner looking towards the Davidson County Courthouse, which is visible in the distance. The Pilcher Building (144-146 Second Avenue North) is visible on the right side. The elaborate cornice and the window moldings of the large tan building are an example of Victorian Italianate architecture. The building (148-152 Second Avenue North) was once home to Cheek-Neal Coffee Co. and later to Nashville Sash and Door. The angular red awning for Mere Bulles Restaurant can be seen and the view continues to the north, showing other buildings and businesses. Numerous parked and moving vehicles can be seen. Traffic is one way to the north. Pedestrians are present on the east side of the street. The west side of the street is in heavy shadow. Photographed by the Nashville architect Charles Wesley Warterfield, Jr. (1926-1998). The original is a 35 mm color transparency (2 x 2 in. slide mount).</dc:description>
