<dc:title>James S. Tippett photo album: Peabody Demonstration School, circa 1922 </dc:title>

Tippett left the school to join the Lincoln School at Teachers College in N.Y., as an instructor and special investigator.  He began to write books for children, as well as short stories, poems, and essays on education during his career.  In 1972 his name was added to the North Carolina Educational Hall of Fame.  Historically, the Peabody Demonstration School was established in 1915 on the George Peabody School for Teachers&#8217; campus, and had its origins in the Winthrop Model School, the first southern school for demonstrating teaching methods.  Winthrop was founded in 1892 on the University of Nashville campus by the Peabody Board of Trustees.  The Peabody Demonstration School was closed in 1974, and a group of parents, alumni, students and teachers formed the University School of Nashville.  The school now occupies seven acres across from Vanderbilt University.  Forms part of James S. Tippett photo album, Peabody Demonstration School.  1 photo album w b &amp; w photos.  </dc:description>
