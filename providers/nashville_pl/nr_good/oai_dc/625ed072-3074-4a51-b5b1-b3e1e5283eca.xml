<dc:title>"The Tax Hike" chart: leaf 02, ca. 1962</dc:title>
<dc:description>An anti-Metro chart titled "The Tax Hike", circa 1962.  The chart describes the supposed tax increases that would result from the consolidation of the city and county governments.  There was a substantial protest movement against consolidation at this time.  Some opponents argued that creating a single government entity would be more costly in the long run and would not meet public service needs of the community.  b &amp; w; 11 x 14 in.</dc:description>
