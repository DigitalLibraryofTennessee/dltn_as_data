<dc:title>Salvage scrap drive in Nashville and Middle Tennessee region, 1942 October</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pictured: &#8220;No age limit on patriotism: when Jackson County started assembling scrap to enter the Banner contest just about everybody in the county took part in a mass movement of patriotism.  Young and old came out to a scrap rally at Gainesboro, where Mrs. Matilda Whattaker, almost 80, is pictured (left) bringing her contribution to be placed in the scrap depot by her granddaughter, Bette Van Hooser Sircy, 17, who plays in the high school band. &#8220; During World War II Americans were active with scrap drives to help the war effort.  Local communities were salvaging raw materials such as metal, rags, rubber, and paper to be used to supply troops.  These special home front war programs were often well-coordinated through committees that engaged widespread urban and rural participation and motivated patriotism and community spirit.
