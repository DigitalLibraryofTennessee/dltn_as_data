<dc:title>Letter from P.J. Williamson to his wife, Eunice, during the Civil War, 1864 August 02</dc:title>
<dc:description>A letter from Dutch immigrant, Peter J. Williamson, back home to his wife, Eunice, during the Civil War.  In 1862 Williamson enlisted as a Private in the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, Company F and was ultimately promoted to Full 1st Lieutenant.  During the war, Williamson's regiment was involved in scouting and raids in Missouri and Arkansas and saw battle in the Middle Tennessee, Chickamauga, and Atlanta campaigns. In this letter from Marietta, Georgia, Williamson writes hastily to let Eunice know he is doing well after participating in McCook's Raid.  He reports their movements and successes, including damage to the railroad depot, until on their return they encountered an overwhelming force of Confederates.  He mentions some casualties on both sides and the grazing shot he received in his wrist.  He describes the fighting on the main line as "heavy."  He closes by telling her he will provide a more concise description of the raid in his next letter and reassures her of his safety.  Forms part of the Peter J. Williamson Letters. 1 letter : col. ; 8  x 10  in.</dc:description>
