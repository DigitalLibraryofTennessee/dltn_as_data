<dc:title>Otter Creek Church of Christ, 2001 December</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of Otter Creek Church of Christ located at 5253 Granny White Pike in Nashville, Tennessee.  The congregation was founded in 1929 with 28 people attending services in a home on Otter Creek Road.  The first church, built in 1930, was constructed with materials donated from the original home of David Lipscomb.  The pictured church on Granny White was built in 1950 in the Forest Hills neighborhood.  The church started a Kindergarten program in 1960.  The foundation is made of smooth cut stones.  The exterior walls are red brick.  The roof is gabled and hipped and composed of tar shingles.  The windows are clear glass with storm windows on the outside.  The doors are a combination of metal and wood.  Four columns stand at the entranceway under the gabled porch.  The church now meets at a new location in Brentwood, Tennessee.  According to the city directory, a form of the Kindergarten still meets at the Granny White address.  Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4  x 6  in.</dc:description>
