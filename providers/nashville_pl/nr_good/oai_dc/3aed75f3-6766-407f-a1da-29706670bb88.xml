<dc:title>Letter from P.J. Williamson to his wife, Eunice, 1869 September 12</dc:title>
<dc:description>A letter from Dutch immigrant, Peter J. Williamson, to his wife, Eunice, in the years following the Civil War.  In 1862 Williamson enlisted as a Private in the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, Company F and was ultimately promoted to Full 1st Lieutenant.  During the war, Williamson's regiment was involved in scouting and raids in Missouri and Arkansas and saw battle in the Middle Tennessee, Chickamauga, and Atlanta campaigns. After the war, he and his family settled in Nashville and he became an architect.  In this letter from Nashville, Tennessee, Williamson is glad to hear that Eunice's health is improving but does not wish her to return from California until she is fully able to.  He mentions their children, Willy and Johnny, including that Johnny will start school the next week.  He further mentions that her parents are with her at that point.  He further discusses when she will return, his hope that she will be home by Christmas and her expression of homesickness.  He relates news of John Bell's funeral procession and his challenge for the Presidency in 1860 versus Lincoln.  He mentions a clipping from the Republican Banner concerning Bell's procession and one concerning Eunice's departure to California.  Williamson then reports on some architecture plans he is developing for the corner of Church and Summer streets across from the 1st Presbyterian Church.  He closes by asking her to pay respects to their family and in a post script asks her to reveal when she is thinking of returning home.  Forms part of the Peter J. Williamson Letters. 1 letter : col. ; 8 x 10 in.</dc:description>
