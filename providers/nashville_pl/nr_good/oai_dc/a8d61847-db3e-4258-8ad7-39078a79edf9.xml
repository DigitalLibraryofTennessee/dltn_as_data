<dc:title>Howard High School, Nashville, Tennessee, 1978 May</dc:title>
<dc:description>An exterior view of old Howard High School, located at 700 2nd Avenue South, Nashville, Tennessee, circa May, 1978.  Howard School remained in use as a downtown academic facility until 1969.  During the early 1970's, the building was pretty much vacant until Nashville officials decided to use it to house various city offices.  The high school portion was renovated, and the auditorium floor was leveled to house the title division of the County Court Clerk's office.  The elementary wing was demolished circa 2008, and efforts to transfer Howard School into Howard Office Building began in earnest.  Forms part of the Claynita Harris Slide Collection.  The original is a 35 mm color transparency (2 x 2 in. slide mount) </dc:description>
