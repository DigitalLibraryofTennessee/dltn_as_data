<dc:title>Photograph of street scene in Dreiborn, Germany, 1944</dc:title>
<dc:description>Street scene in Dreiborn, Germany, 1944. Shows battle-scarred buildings, muddy street, many communications wires, and an American jeep and an MP at an intersection. A church steeple, shrouded in mist, was occupied by a German sniper who killed an MP shortly before this photograph was taken. Americans subsequently killed the sniper, who tumbled out of the steeple "just like in the movies," Thompson said. The numerous communications wires in the foreground indicate the area changed hands often; each side would cut their enemy's wires, and string their own.  Joe Thompson Jr., a native Nashvillian, served in the Army Air Corps in the 109th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron of the 9th Air Force in Europe during World War II. He took numerous photographs during his off-duty time. Forms part of the Veterans History Project. 1 photograph negative : b &amp; w ; 120 mm.</dc:description>
