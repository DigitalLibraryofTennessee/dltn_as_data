<dc:title>Photograph of the National Baptist Publishing Board,  1960 October 06</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of the National Baptist Publishing Board building on Second Avenue in Nashville, Tennessee.  The National Baptist Publishing Board began as Dr. R.H. Boyd's dream for African Americans to publish Baptist Sunday School materials for African Americans written by African-American men and women.  Dr. R.H. Boyd was a former slave who moved to Nashville in 1896 after attending college in Texas where he joined the Baptist Church.  Upon coming to Nashville, Boyd teamed up with Reverend C.H. Clark, and the two became comrades in Christian education publishing for African Americans.  They formed the National Baptist Publishing Board and eventually moved their cramped, two-room office into the Victorian-style W.H. Leickhardt house on Market (now Second Avenue) and Locust Streets that is pictured here.  The publishing company was a leader in the forefront of the national civil rights and social agenda.  Today the company is recognized as the leading producer of religious literature and church supplies for the African American market. The company specializes in the development of contemporary Christian education materials for churches and families, which provide positive African American imagery and nurturing Christian values.  The building in this photograph has been demolished.  Photographed by the Nashville architect Charles Wesley Warterfield, Jr. (1926-1998); the architectural photograph forms part of the Charles Warterfield Architectural Collection. Gift of: The Estate of Charles W. Warterfield, Jr., F. A. I. A. The original is a 35 mm color transparency (2 x 2 in. slide mount)</dc:description>
