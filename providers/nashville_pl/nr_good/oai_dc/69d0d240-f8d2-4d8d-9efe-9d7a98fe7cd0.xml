<dc:title>'Might take some dynamite,' Ware told students at Fisk, from the Nashville Banner, 1967 April 10</dc:title>
<dc:description>A Nashville Banner news clipping article by staff writer Doug Looney covering an address presented at Fisk University by civil rights activist George Ware, of Atlanta, who spoke to students in anthropology professor P.C. Onwuachi's class on April 7, 1967. Ware was quoted as telling students that it "might take some dynamite" to shatter racial barriers.  He also professed to be scared to be an African American in America and questioned what African Americans can accomplish via education given the social barriers.  Thirty-six hours later, Ware was arrested and charged with inciting the riots that occurred over the ensuing weekend. The journal article by staff writer Doug Looney was published in the Nashville Banner, April 10, 1967. Forms part of the Nashville Banner Archives "Miscellaneous - Segregation - Nashville, TN. - 1967 April Riots" Clipping File.</dc:description>
