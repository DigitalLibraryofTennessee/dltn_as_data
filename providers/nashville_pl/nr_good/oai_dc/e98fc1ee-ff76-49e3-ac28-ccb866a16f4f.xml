<dc:title>First American National Bank event in downtown Nashville, Tennessee, circa 1970s</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pictured: A scene from the First American National Bank event in downtown Nashville, circa 1970s.  First American National Bank opened its new twenty-eight story building in the heart of downtown at 315 Deaderick Street on July 30, 1973.  In April of 1974, the dedication ceremonies took place with more than 120 members of the Reserve City Bankers from all over the nation.  The Equitable Life Assurance society of the United States joined First American in the building venture.  In the process of excavating the construction site, the remains of a prehistoric saber-toothed tiger were found in a cave.  This find would later serve as the inspiration of the mascot of the Nashville Predators, an NHL hockey team.  First American was also a leading community sponsor of several Nashville-based sports franchises, including the Tennessee Titans, Nashville Predators, Nashville Kats, and Nashville Sounds.  Forms part of Record Group 3.  The original is a 35 mm color transparency (2 x 2 in. slide mount).</dc:description>
