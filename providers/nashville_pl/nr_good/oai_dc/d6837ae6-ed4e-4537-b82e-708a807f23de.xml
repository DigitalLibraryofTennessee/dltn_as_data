<dc:title>Ocean Way Nashville Recording Studios, 2001 May</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of Ocean Way Nashville Recording Studios, formerly Church of the Advent, an Episcopal church located at 1200 Seventeenth Avenue South in Nashville, Tennessee.  The congregation was formed in 1857 and the church building was erected in 1910.  The building was designed by architect Robert Sharp in the Gothic Revival style.  The foundation is stone.  The exterior walls are brick.  The windows are stained glass with clear protectors.  The doors are made of wood.  In 1972 the congregation moved to a church in Franklin, Tennessee, and the building was sold to the YMCA for use as Urban Village, a vocational and rehabilitation program.  In 1977 the church was sold to Tennessee Performing Arts Foundation for use as an office and theater facility.  In 1981 the building was purchased by the Alamo Foundation and used as a church annex for cult leader Tony Alamo.  In 1993 a Los Angeles recording company, Ocean Way Record One, bought the building and converted the old church into three separate recording studios.  In 2003, the studio was bought by Belmont University but continues to operate under the same Ocean Way management and name.  The studios provide internships and learning opportunities for Belmont students during off time.  Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4  x 6  in.</dc:description>
