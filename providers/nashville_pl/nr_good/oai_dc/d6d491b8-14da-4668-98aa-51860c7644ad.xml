Jersey Farms was a dairy company located at 825 Eighth Avenue South.  Henry C. Hibbs was a leading architect in Nashville and the South known for his signature collegiate gothic and neo-collegiate gothic styles of architecture which can be seen in the design of Scarritt Bennett College for Christian Workers (now Scarritt Bennett Conference Center).  Some of his prominent designs include the Nashville Union Stockyards building, City Market House and Nashville Electric Service.  According to census records, Arch Trawick was a sales manager of cakes and cheeses.  Forms part of the Henry C. Hibbs Papers. 1 letter: col. ; 8.5 x 11 in.</dc:description>
