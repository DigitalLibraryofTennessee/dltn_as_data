<dc:title>Photograph of the north side of Nashville's Public Square, circa 1959</dc:title>
<dc:description>Harris-Davis and Company, J. L. Turner and Son, and J. S. Reeves and Company were among the buildings that once delineated the outer perimeter of the public square in Nashville. The square, with the county courthouse, city hall and market center, was a focus of wholesale commerce and political activity for the city for many years. The old city hall, dating from the 1850s, was replaced by a new city hall and courthouse in 1937. Most of the remaining buildings were destroyed in the 1970s as part of urban renewal projects. These buildings formed part of the north side of the square, running west from 2nd Avenue North. Among them are the last of the perimeter buildings to be demolished. The Reeves Building, 208-210 Public Square North, is believed to have been constructed in the late 1850s. It was built by Samuel D. Morgan to as a home to his wholesale dry goods business. Iron cores were used in the columns of the building. J. S. Reeves purchased the building, which became the home of his dry goods business until 1964. It, along with the buildings to the left of it in the picture, was demolished in 1975. In 1981, the entire block became the building site of the Metro Criminal Justice Center. Photographed by the Nashville architect Charles Wesley Warterfield, Jr. (1926-1998); the architectural photograph forms part of the Charles Warterfield Architectural Collection.
