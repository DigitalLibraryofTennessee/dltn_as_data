<dc:title>Nashville City Schools, Napier Elementary</dc:title>
<dc:description>Named after Alonzo Napier, brother of J.C. Napier, this original Napier school building, seen here from the side, opened mid way through the 1897-1898 school year. It was located at the corner of Robinson and Fairfield. Completion of the school relieved the student population at Pearl School. Napier was modeled after the room plan in which a teacher had her pupils before him or her the entire day, while many of the Nashville schools followed the hall plan. A three stage building program was completed in 1966, replacing the original structure. 11 x 14 in.</dc:description>
