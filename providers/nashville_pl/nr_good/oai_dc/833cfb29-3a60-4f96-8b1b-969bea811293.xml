<dc:title>Oak Hill residence of Mr. and Mrs. Van Leer Kirkman, between 1907 and 1914</dc:title>
<dc:description>A postcard of the Oak Hill mansion, the grand 19th century residence of Mr. and Mrs. Van Leer Kirkman, located approximately seven miles south of Nashville on Franklin Pike in Davidson County, Tennessee. Oak Hill, which suggests a French chateau style of architecture, was built in 1887, upon a site with historical associations such as Confederate rifle pits in the grounds and the great Harpeth Hills where Civil War soldiers battled in 1864. The architectural design includes many gables, a turret and a large centrally placed cupola, with a massive spire. Van Leer Kirkman had married Kate Thompson, a relative of the pioneer Thompson family on Franklin Pike. Kate was a prominent socialite who often hosted receptions at her mansion and served as the official president of the woman's board of the Tennessee Centennial of 1897. In this postcard image, two artillery cannons are pictured on the landscaped lawn. Today, the First Presbyterian Church occupies the site at the corner of Franklin Pike and Tyne Boulevard. Forms part of the Nashville Room Postcard Collection. 1 postcard : col. ; 3.5  x 5.5  in. </dc:description>
