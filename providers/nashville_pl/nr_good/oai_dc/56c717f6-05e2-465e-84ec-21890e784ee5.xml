<dc:title>Two men and a boy pose in front of a Hermitage Taxi Service airplane at Hampton Field, 1920 March 21</dc:title>
<dc:description>Photograph of two white men and a black boy standing in front of a Curtiss JN &#8220;Jenny&#8221; aircraft. Each man is wearing an aviator or &#8220;bomber&#8221; hat with goggles and the boy is dressed in overalls and a button-up shirt. One man has his arms around the boy and the child is gripping the man&#8217;s hands. The photograph was taken on March 21, 1920 at Hampton Field. The airplane is branded with a white Curtiss logo on a dark field. The airplane was used by the Hermitage Taxi Service to provide private flights to other cities in addition to their usual local vehicle taxi service in Nashville.

<dc:description>R.D. Goad, the proprietor of Hermitage Taxi Service, acquired the plane in 1920 to expand the business&#8217;s services. Goad hired Dick Kunzl from Boston to pilot the airplane and transport customers up to 25,000 miles from their starting point. It is unclear if these men are pictured in the photograph.</dc:description>
