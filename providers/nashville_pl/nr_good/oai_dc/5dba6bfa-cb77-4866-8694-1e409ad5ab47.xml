<dc:title>Tulip Street United Methodist Church, 2000 October</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of Tulip Street United Methodist Church located at 522 Russell Street in the Edgefield Historic District in Nashville, Tennessee.  The church sits at the corner of South Fifth Street, which was originally named Tulip Street in the early days of the city.  The congregation was organized in 1859 while the current church building was completed in 1892.  Designed by church member Thomas Lynch Dismukes, the building is recognized as Neo-Romanesque in style, characterized by rounded arches, vaulted ceilings, and extensive use of terra cotta moldings on the exterior.  The architect for the project was Jul. G. Zwicker.  The foundation is stone.  The walls are red brick.  The roof is gabled.  Some windows are arched.  The doors are hand carved wood with stained glass transoms.  A new glass entryway covers the doors.  Special features include a stone retaining wall and an iron gate surrounding the property.  This church was one of only two churches in the area that emerged from the Great East Nashville Fire of 1916 unscathed.  Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : b &amp; w ; 4  x 6  in.</dc:description>
