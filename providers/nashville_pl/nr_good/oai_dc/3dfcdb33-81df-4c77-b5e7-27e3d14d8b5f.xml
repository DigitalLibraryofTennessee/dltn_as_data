<dc:title>Letter from P.J. Williamson to his wife, Eunice, during the Civil War, 1865 August 31</dc:title>
<dc:description>A letter from Dutch immigrant, Peter J. Williamson, back home to his wife, Eunice, during the Civil War.  In 1862 Williamson enlisted as a Private in the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, Company F and was ultimately promoted to Full 1st Lieutenant.  During the war, Williamson's regiment was involved in scouting and raids in Missouri and Arkansas and saw battle in the Middle Tennessee, Chickamauga, and Atlanta campaigns. In this letter from Nashville, Tennessee, Williamson has just returned from a trip to Oshkosh, Wisconsin, and will be beginning work for Colonel Irvin the next day.  He informs Eunice of some housing issues in Nashville and mentions someone taking daguerreotype photographs at the corner of Ferry and High streets in Oshkosh.  He describes the best route for her to take to Nashville including stops in Chicago, Michigan City, Indianapolis and Louisville.  He tells her he is going to be designing plans for the Andersonville Prison although he is unsure how steady the work will be.  He complains of a swelling on his right hand that might impair his ability to work and closes by asking Eunice to tell the "old folks" that he will write the next week.  Forms part of the Peter J. Williamson Letters. 1 letter : col. ; 8 x 10 in.</dc:description>
