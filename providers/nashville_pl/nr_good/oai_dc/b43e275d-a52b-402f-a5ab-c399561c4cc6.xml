<dc:description>A captioned photo from the Nashville Times (1940), about Nashville Times carrier boys. The caption reads: &#8220;More than 200 Nashville Times carrier boys were guests last night of the Dodson Shows, at Fortieth and Charlotte, when all the entertainment features were theirs for the seeing. The rides, too, were free, through the courtesy of F. &#8220;Whitey&#8221; Newell, press representative and Mr. Dodson, owner of the carnival. The boys said they had the time of their lives.&#8221; Forms part of the Nashville Times newspaper collection. 1 digital photo.</dc:description>
