<dc:title>Glimpses of Nashville, Tennessee: City Hall</dc:title>
<dc:description>The old city hall (pictured) was originally built circa the 1850s.  The Public Square, with the county courthouse, city hall and market center, was a focus of wholesale commerce and political activity for the city for many years.  On market days the square was especially busy.  The old city hall building was razed in 1935 and was replaced by a new city hall and courthouse in 1937.  Forms part of Glimpses of Nashville. 1 booklet </dc:description>
