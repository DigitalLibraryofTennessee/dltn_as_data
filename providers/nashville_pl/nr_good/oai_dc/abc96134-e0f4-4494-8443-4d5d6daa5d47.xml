<dc:title>Cavert School in Nashville, Tennessee, circa 1996</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of the Cavert School, located at 2500 Fairfax Avenue in Nashville, circa 1996. Cavert School opened as an elementary school circa 1928. The structure is designed in the classical style and with Eakin School was one of Nashville's early New Deal projects. The school was named for Dr. A. J. Cavert who served as a principal at Howard and Fogg schools among others. Cavert became a junior high circa 1936 about when Eakin school was built. A new gymnasium was built in 1964. In the fall of 1965, Cavert was phased out as a junior high and became a special education center. Eakin Elementary expanded construction onto the historical building and today the two buildings function as Eakin Elementary School. Eakin was named for Mrs. John Hill Eakin, the first woman to become a member of the Nashville City Board of Education. Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph : b &amp; w ; 5 x 7 in.</dc:description>
