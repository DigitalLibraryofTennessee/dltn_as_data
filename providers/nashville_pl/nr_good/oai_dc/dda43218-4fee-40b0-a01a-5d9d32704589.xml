<dc:title>Central Church of Christ, 2001 November 17</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of Central Church of Christ located at 145 Fifth Avenue, Nashville, Tennessee.  This church was built in 1925 with a congregation of only 47 members.  Membership today now exceeds 1,200.  Early works of the church ranged from general goodwill efforts such as clothing and food drives, to establishing the longest-running Christian radio program in U.S. history, to providing free dental and other medical care to the poor.  Central Church of Christ's heritage is heavily tied to operating two supervised dormitory buildings for young men and women who had moved to the city from farms and small towns to work or go to school.  These homes closed in 1972 due to low occupancy.  The radio show still broadcasts daily, Monday through Friday from 12:15-12:30 p.m.  Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4  x 6  in.</dc:description>
