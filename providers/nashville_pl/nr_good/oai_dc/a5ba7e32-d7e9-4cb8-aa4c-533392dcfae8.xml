<dc:title>Nashville Bridge Company aerial view, 1960 January 19</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of an aerial view of the Nashville Bridge Company with the Shelby Street Bridge and downtown Nashville, Tennessee, in the background. The company was started in 1902 by Arthur J. Dyer, who graduated from Vanderbilt with a degree in engineering in 1891. The company fabricated steel for several Nashville landmarks in the early 1900s including the Arcade, Nashville Trust Building and the Hermitage Hotel. Over the world war years they built tankers, barges, towboats, steamers, and, during World War II, minesweepers. In the late 1940s they met the demand for bridge construction, and later barges, towboats, bridge overpasses, and, in 1960, fabricated steel for the NASA service tower of the Saturn missiles. Mr. Dyer sold the company in 1968.  Forms part of the Nashville Banner Archives. 1 photograph negative : b &amp; w ; 3.25 x 4.25 in.</dc:description>
