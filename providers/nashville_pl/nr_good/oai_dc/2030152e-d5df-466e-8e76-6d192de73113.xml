<dc:title>Excerpt 6 from oral history interview with Kenneth L. Roberts, 2006 July 27</dc:title>
<dc:description>An excerpt from an oral history interview with Nashville business and civic leader Kenneth L. Roberts, conducted on 27 July 2006 by Cabot Pyle as part of the Nashville Public Library's Nashville Business Leaders Oral History Project:  The Turner Interviews.  Roberts outlines his theory that today's Nashville is a result of five things that happened during the 1960s.  He discusses the first of these events, which was the sit-in movement.  He also discusses civil rights leaders involved in the movement in Nashville, including John Lewis, Kelly Miller Smith, and Stokely Carmichael.  The complete interview, as well as an index, is available in the repository.</dc:description>
