<dc:title>Commerce Building and Auditorium at the Tennessee Centennial and International Exposition, circa 1897</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of the Commerce Building (pictured on left) and Auditorium (pictured on right) at the Tennessee Centennial and International Exposition, circa 1897. These non-extant structures were built for the celebration of Tennessee's 100th year of statehood that opened May 1, 1897, at Nashville's Centennial Park (2814 West End Avenue), and continued for six months, closing on October 31, 1897. The formal celebration of Tennessee's 100th birthday occurred on June 1, 1896, with a grand inaugural day parade commemorating the centennial anniversary of Tennessee's statehood (Tennessee was admitted to the Union in 1796 as the 16th state). The Tennessee Centennial Exposition was a great success and drew approximately 1.8 million visitors. The opening exercises were held in the Auditorium, with the Legislature, Gov. Taylor and his staff, the Executive Committee of the Centennial Company, and the Supreme Court assembled and seated on the stage. President John W. Thomas began the exercises with an address upon the purposes of the centennial. After the speeches and music the machinery was formally started by the pressure of a button by President McKinley in Washington. The Commerce Building featured exhibits from Nashville businesses such as Phillips &amp; Buttorff Manufacturing Company, showcasing displays of manufactured goods. International exhibits by foreign countries were also represented. Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph : sepia ; 5 x 8 in.</dc:description>
