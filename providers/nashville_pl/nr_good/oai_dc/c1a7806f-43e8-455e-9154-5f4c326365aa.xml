<dc:title>Salvage scrap drive in Nashville and Middle Tennessee region, 1942 October</dc:title>
<dc:description>
Pictured: &#8220;Scrap is chief study at Ransom School: the pupils at Ransom School are some of the county&#8217;s most diligent scrappers, with all spare time devoted to the canvassing of neighborhood homes and farms.  Some of the school&#8217;s chief workers are shown with a portion of their collections.  Miss Elizabeth Hogle is principal and Mrs. Jane O&#8217;Brien is faculty sponsor of the scrap drive.  Gus Weiss, Jr., is the &#8216;colonel&#8217; of the school&#8217;s Junior Service Army in charge of the drive.&#8221; During World War II Americans were active with scrap drives to help the war effort.  Local communities were salvaging raw materials such as metal, rags, rubber, and paper to be used to supply troops.  These special home front war programs were often well-coordinated through committees that engaged widespread urban and rural participation and motivated patriotism and community spirit.
