<dc:title>Salvage scrap drive in Nashville and Middle Tennessee region, 1942</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pictured: Young boys and women standing beside a scrap collection at an unidentified rural location in Middle Tennessee, circa 1942.  During World War II Americans were active with scrap drives to help the war effort.  Local communities were salvaging raw materials such as metal, rags, rubber, and paper to be used to supply troops.  These special home front war programs were often well-coordinated through committees that engaged widespread urban and rural participation and motivated patriotism and community spirit.  Forms part of Record Group 412, Photographs Collection. 1 photograph negative : b &amp; w ; 4 x 5 in.</dc:description>
