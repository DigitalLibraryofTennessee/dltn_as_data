<dc:title>Photograph of a the terra cotta architectural design on the Elks Lodge building in Nashville, Tennessee, circa 1960s</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of a terra cotta design on the south side of the Elks Lodge building at 310 6th Avenue North. The building was the home to Lodge no. 72 of the Benevolent and Protective Order of the Elks (BPOE) beginning in 1904, serving various functions, including that of club house. The exact date of construction of the building is uncertain, but it appears as a dwelling on 1888 fire insurance maps. It housed the lodge offices, a library, and entertainment facilities. It was razed in the 1970s to make way for the James K. Polk State Office Building and the Tennessee Performing Arts Center. The lodge relocated to quarters in west Nashville at that time. Photographed by the Nashville architect Charles Wesley Warterfield, Jr. (1926-1998); the architectural photograph forms part of the Charles Warterfield Architectural Collection. Gift of: The Estate of Charles W. Warterfield, Jr., F. A. I. A. The original is a 35 mm color transparency (2 x 2 in. slide mount)</dc:description>
