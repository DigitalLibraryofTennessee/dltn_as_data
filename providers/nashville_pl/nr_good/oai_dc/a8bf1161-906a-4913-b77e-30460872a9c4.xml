<dc:title>Greek Republic flag presented to American Legion and State of Tennessee, 1931 September 06</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of the Greek Republic flag presented to the American Legion and State of Tennessee, Sunday, September 6, 1931 at the Parthenon in Centennial Park, Nashville, Tennessee. The flag was presented to the state of Tennessee on the steps of the Parthenon on September 6, 1931, by George Catros, chairman of the committee for the presentation, and was accepted by John E. McCall, state commander of the American Legion, with Tennessee Governor Henry H. Horton. This ceremony reciprocated the courtesy extended to Greece by Tennessee the previous year, when the State flag of Tennessee was presented to the Greek Government during ceremonies at the steps of the Parthenon in Athens, Greece, with Legionaires participating in that ceremony also. Over 2,000 persons attended the flag presentation in Centennial Park and witnessed the pageant of flags which preceded the presentation. Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph : b &amp; w ; 8 x 10 in.</dc:description>
