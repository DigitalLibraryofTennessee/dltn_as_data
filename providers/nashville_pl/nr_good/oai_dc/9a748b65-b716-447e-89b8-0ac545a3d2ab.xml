<dc:title>Tennessee Teachers Credit Union, 2001 May 30</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of the Tennessee Teachers Credit Union located at 1400 Eighth Avenue South in Nashville, Tenn.  The building originally was constructed as a church for the South End Methodist Episcopal congregation in 1910.  An education wing was added in the 1930s.  The congregation changed its name to South End Methodist Church in the 1940s.  In 1985 the credit union bought the building from Bob Farris, local businessman who was operating a business called the Swim Shop there.  The foundation is made of rough cut stone blocks.  The exterior walls are brick.  The roof is gabled and hipped with tar shingles.  The windows are clear glass.  The doors are wood and glass.  Special features include a large tower adorned with a weather vane.  This church has been registered with the Metro Historical Commission as an historic Nashville landmark.  Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4  x 6  in.</dc:description>
