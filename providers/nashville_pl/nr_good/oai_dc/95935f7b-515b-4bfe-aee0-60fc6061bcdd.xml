<dc:title>Christopher Hathaway remembers his parents, 2007 October 20</dc:title>
<dc:description>An edited excerpt with transcript and photograph from an interview with Christopher Hathaway, conducted on 20 October 2007 by StoryCorps Facilitator Cynthia Murphy at the Nashville StoryCorps StoryBooth, located in the Nashville Room of the Nashville Public Library. Hathaway shares memories of his parents' patience, his father's attendance at his football games, and how his father's work ethic influenced his own.  He also tells a story about his father's reaction when he shirked his assigned chore to go swimming. The complete, un-edited interview, as well as an index, is available in the Special Collections Division. These interviews were recorded by StoryCorps at the Nashville Public Library with the support of the Nashville Public Library Foundation and are provided courtesy of StoryCorps, a national initiative of Sound Portraits Productions to record and collect oral history interviews. www.storycorps.net</dc:description>
