<dc:title>First American National Bank ground breaking for new center in downtown Nashville, 1971 May</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pictured: Mayor Beverly Briley at the podium, related to the First American National Bank ground breaking in downtown Nashville, circa May 1971.  The First American National Bank opened its new twenty-eight story building for the first time on July 30, 1973, at the intersection of 3rd Avenue N and Union, also along 4th Avenue N.  Several top bank officials are listed in the 1973 City Directory: Parkes Armistead, Honorary Chairman of the Board; Andrew Benedict, Chairman of the Board; William F. Greenwood, Vice-Chairman of the Board; T. Scott Fillebrown Jr., President; W Lane Abernathy, Senior Vice-President and Trust Officer.  In April of 1974, the official dedication ceremonies took place with more than 120 members of the Reserve City Bankers from all over the nation.  The Equitable Life Assurance society of the United States joined First American in the building venture.  In the process of excavating the construction site, the remains of a prehistoric saber-toothed tiger were found in a cave.  This find would later serve as the inspiration of the mascot of the Nashville Predators, an NHL hockey team.  First American was also a leading community sponsor of several Nashville-based sports franchises, including the Tennessee Titans, Nashville Predators, Nashville Kats, and Nashville Sounds.
