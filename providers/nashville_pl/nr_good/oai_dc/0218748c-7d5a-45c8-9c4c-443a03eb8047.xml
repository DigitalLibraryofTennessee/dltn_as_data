<dc:title>Gerst House, 2nd Avenue North, c.1960s</dc:title>
<dc:description>Photograph of the Gerst House Restaurant, located at 315 2nd Avenue North. First opened in 1955 by William J. Gerst after the closure of the Gerst Brewing Company, the restaurant served German-American food and beer, and it was a popular gathering place for journalists, politicians, and attorneys due to its proximity to the Davidson County Courthouse. Urban development led to the Gerst House being moved to 301 Woodland Street in 1970, and it later changed its name to "Gerst Haus" in 1988. The restaurant closed permanently in 2018, and the building was demolished in 2021. Forms part of the MDHA Photograph Collection. 1 photograph : b &amp; w. </dc:description>
