<dc:title>Nashville City Schools, Ross School</dc:title>
<dc:description>Located on Grove Avenue, which later became Ordway Place, Ross School was erected in 1907. The school was named for Marcus M. Ross who worked as a teacher and principal for Nashville city schools. In 1933, a tornado that swept through East Nashville damaged the school building. The structure closed in 1988, and a new building was constructed on McFerrin Avenue at the site of the old East High School football field.11 x 14 in.</dc:description>
