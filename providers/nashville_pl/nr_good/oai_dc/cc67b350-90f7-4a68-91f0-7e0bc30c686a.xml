<dc:title>Aerial photograph of interstate construction in North Nashville near Jefferson Street, ca. 1968.</dc:title>
<dc:description>Aerial photograph of interstate construction in North Nashville looking west, circa 1968, taken by Metro Photographer William M. King. Photograph shows the construction of I-40 in the areas of Jefferson Street and Meharry Blvd. A railroad runs horizontally across both streets. Not marked on the image is Heiman St., which runs parallel to Jefferson St. on the right, and curves away in the distance in the upper right corner. The building located near this curve is on the edge of TSU&#8217;s campus. Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph : b &amp; w ; 8 x 10 in.</dc:description>
<dc:description>This portion of Jefferson Street, not far from the campuses of Fisk University, Meharry Medical College, and Tennessee State University, was the center of black life and culture in Nashville at this time. The construction of the interstate destroyed significant portions of this important social and cultural hub, as well as many parts of the nearby neighborhoods. This photograph reveals just how extensive and disruptive the route of the interstate was to this African American community in Nashville. Interstate 40 would pass through this location when it was built between 1968 and 1971. It joined Interstate 265 in a major interchange just east of this location, composing the northwest portion of the downtown inner loop. In 2000, Interstate 265 ceased to exist, and was redesignated as part of Interstate 65. </dc:description>
