<dc:title>Colonel Luke Lea at Lebanon, Tennessee, just out of prison, 1936 April 03  </dc:title>
<dc:description>Colonel Luke Lea, surrounded by a crowd and a brass band at the town square in Lebanon, Tennessee upon his release from prison in 1936. Luke Lea (1879-1945) was born at Lealand, the family&#8217;s 1,000-acre farm on the outskirts of Nashville.  He was a descendant of the pioneer Overton and Cocke families, Lea was the son of Ella Cocke and Overton Lea.  He was a Democratic United States Senator from Tennessee from 1911 to 1917.  During World War I, he raised and commanded a volunteer regiment, later the 114th Field Artillery that received distinction for battles in France.  In the 1920s, Lea was a major investor of the banking firm of Caldwell &amp; Company that closed in 1930 during the depression. Lea was often in alliance with financier Rogers Caldwell and established a publishing empire.  With the failure of the banking firm, creditors foreclosed on many of his large real estate holdings. He was on trial in North Carolina where he was convicted of banking law violations.  Lea was paroled in 1936, after 23 months in prison, and received a full pardon the following year.  The original land grant establishing Percy Warner Park was donated by Lea and his family to Nashville circa 1927, and the park is named for Lea's father-in-law.
