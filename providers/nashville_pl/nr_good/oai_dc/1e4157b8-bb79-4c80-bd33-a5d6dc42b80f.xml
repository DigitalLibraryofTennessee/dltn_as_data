<dc:title>The State Bank of Tennessee, circa 1859</dc:title>
<dc:description>A page from a mounted and bound volume of twenty-five pen-and-ink wash drawings, and two pen-and-ink maps of Nashville created by William A. Eichbaum during the 1850s.  Eichbaum was a Nashville bookseller and resident for fifty years.  This drawing is of the Bank of Tennessee located at the corner of Cherry and Union streets.  Erected in 1853, it was made of brick and stone.  It had a wooden shingle roof, and measured fifty by eighty-eight feet.  Francis Strickland was the architect.  He modeled the design after his father's Second Bank of the United States in Philadelphia.  During the Civil War this bank was used by the Federal Army as its paymaster's department building.  Forms part of the William A. Eichbaum Sketchbook. 1 drawing : col. ; 5.75  x 9  in.</dc:description>
