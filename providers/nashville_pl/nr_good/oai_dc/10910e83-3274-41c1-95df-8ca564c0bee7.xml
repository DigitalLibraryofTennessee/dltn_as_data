<dc:title>Photograph of staff members in front of a Nashville Public Library bookmobile, circa 1955</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of staff members pictured in front of a "library-on-wheels" bookmobile of the Nashville Public Library in Nashville, Tennessee, circa 1955. This particular bookmobile was in service from 1954-1973, with approximately 3000 volumes housed aboard the vehicle. Bookmobile staff (pictured from left to right) are an unidentified person, Miss Diane O'Donnell, Mrs. Grace Darden, and Paul Law, Driver. The bookmobile service in Davidson County, Tennessee began in the 1940's, when the State Library Project furnished a bookmobile which made weekly demonstration rounds through the county. In 1947, the Nashville Public Library initiated the bookmobile service; by 1956, service had been extended to all of Davidson County. Approximately 3000 volumes were housed aboard the vehicle. Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph : b &amp; w ; 8 x 10 in.</dc:description>
