<dc:title>There&#8217;s something about a soldier, from the Nashville Times, 1940</dc:title>
<dc:description>A captioned photo from the Nashville Times (1940), showing the patriotic group as &#8220;the small but most colorful part of Hume-Fogg&#8217;s R. O. T. C., as it lined up with lifted chins and straightened shoulders on the steps of the school on Broad Street. Beauty as well as the purely military plays a prominent part in the corp&#8217;s general set-up, as evidenced by presence in the above picture of the sponsors, Ann Morrison, extreme left, Battalion sponsor; Doris Grubbs, left, regimental sponsor; Betsey Harrison, center, Company A sponsor, and Jennie Lee Jackson, extreme right, Company B. sponsor. The others, left to right, are Charles Vaughn, color bearer; Battalion Commander Maj. Gay Weber, Staff Sergeant John Greene, Company A. Captain Dick McLaughlin, Company B. Captain Luther George, and Color Bearer Jack Martin.&#8221; Forms part of the Nashville Times newspaper collection. 1 digital photo.</dc:description>
