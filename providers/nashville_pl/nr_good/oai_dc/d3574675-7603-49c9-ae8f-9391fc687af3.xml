<dc:title>Photograph of the Doctors' Building, between 1916 and 1921</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of the Doctors' Building located on the corner of Church Street and Polk Street.  The steel frame structure was built in two stages.  The first three stories were built in 1916 and the second three stories were built in 1921.  Developed by Nashville architects Dougherty and Gardner, the building rests on the site of the late 19th century mansion once belonging to railroad magnate, E.W. Cole.  The exterior of the building was designed in the Italian Renaissance style.  Intricate architectural details embellish the outside of the structure.  Some of these ornamental designs include wreaths, garlands of fruit, floral motifs, winged cherubs, lion heads, and zig-zag banding.  Initially built to provide working space for Nashville medical doctors and dentists, the structure underwent a 4.5 million dollar renovation in the 1980s and became an address for health care, architecture and real estate companies.  In 2006 the building was sold to an Indianapolis hotel developer.  The Doctors' Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.  Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph : b &amp; w ; 8 x 10 in.</dc:description>
