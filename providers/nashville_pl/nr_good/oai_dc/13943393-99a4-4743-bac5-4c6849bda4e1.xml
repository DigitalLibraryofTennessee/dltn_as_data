<dc:title>Photograph of the reading room of the Nashville Public Library, circa 1953</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph depicting the remodeled reading room of the Nashville Public Library reading room, circa 1953. The patrons are reading books, with the staff on duty at the service desk. The public library building was constructed with a $100,000 grant from philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, and the cornerstone was laid on April 27, 1903. Officially opened to the public on September 19, 1904, the building was located at 8th Avenue North and Union Street. The Carnegie Library of Nashville was renamed the Nashville Public Library in 1934, being active at this location until 1963, when the new Metropolitan Government began construction on a new main library upon the site. Photographed by Jerome Drown. Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph : b &amp; w ; 8 x 10 in.</dc:description>
