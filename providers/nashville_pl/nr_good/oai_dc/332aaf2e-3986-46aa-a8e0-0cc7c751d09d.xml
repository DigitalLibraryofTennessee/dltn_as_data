<dc:title>Knickerbocker Theater exposed interior walls featuring birds-of-paradise frescoes, Nashville, Tennessee, circa 1995 September</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of the exposed interior walls of the Knickerbocker Theater in Nashville, Tennessee featuring birds-of-paradise frescoes on the walls (pictured in this photograph). The Knickerbocker was originally a magnificent movie house, located in downtown Nashville between Sixth Avenue and Capitol Boulevard at 210 Capitol Boulevard. A published article in the March 22, 1916 issue of the Tennessean newspaper announced the grand opening of the Knickerbocker Theater: "William H. Wassman's latest addition to the motion picture world, which will be thrown open to the public this afternoon at 2:30 o'clock." And further describing the movie house as "beautifully decorated in ivory, green and gold, altogether it is one of the handsomest establishments in the country." Also stating "the excavations, foundations and reinforced and plain concrete work, which are second to none ever constructed in Nashville, were done by Foster &amp; Creighton company." Further, "everything in the steel line connected with the Knickerbocker was furnished and erected by the Nashville Bridge Company." Regarding the interior decorations: "this work was done by Otto Hylen, the noted Nashville artist, who has done work in practically every big building in Tennessee." The birds-of-paradise frescoes pictured in this photograph were possibly created by artist Otto Hylen or the artwork may have been created by another artist during the 1930s renovation work. For many years, the Knickerbocker stood next door to the Florsheim Shoe Shop (a building that is currently occupied by a loan company as of 2009). The Knickerbocker Theater closed in 1961 and subsequently the building was gutted and converted into a Super X drug store that would occupy the building for more than twenty years, first listed in the 1964 Nashville City Directory. By 1990 the building was vacant and subsequently torn down to make way for a parking lot. Photographed by the Nashville architect Charles Wesley Warterfield, Jr. (1926-1998); the architectural photograph forms part of the Charles Warterfield Architectural Collection. Gift of: The Estate of Charles W. Warterfield, Jr., F. A. I. A. The original is a 35 mm color transparency (2 x 2 in. slide mount).</dc:description>
