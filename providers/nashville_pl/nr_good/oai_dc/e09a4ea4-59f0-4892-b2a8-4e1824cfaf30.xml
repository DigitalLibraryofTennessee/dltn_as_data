<dc:description>A captioned photo from the Nashville Times (1940), about &#8220;Here&#8217;s what downtown Nashvillians saw marching down Church Street just before noon today--Manager Gilbert and his victorious Vols returning from a three-game triumph over the Atlanta Crackers. The Vols, playing the Knoxville Smokies at Sulphur Dell this afternoon, in the first local game of the season, were met at Union Station today by a huge crowd of celebrating baseball fans and were led up the street, as shown in the above photograph, by the smart-strutting Tennessee Industrial School Band.&#8221;
