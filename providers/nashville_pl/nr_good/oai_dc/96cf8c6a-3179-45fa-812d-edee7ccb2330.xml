<dc:title>Pennington Bend bridge area, Nashville, Tennessee, between 1964 and 1983</dc:title>
<dc:description>An aerial photograph of the Pennington Bend area of the Cumberland River, located approximately 12 miles northeast to downtown Nashville, Tennessee. The Pennington Bend bridge, a part of the highway system known as Briley Parkway, was officially opened on November 3, 1965.  The bridge was a badly needed crossing, replacing the Williams Ferry, a little eight-car ferry  that was the only direct river-crossing route between the Inglewood-Madison and Donelson communities.  In 1967, the state legislature authorized the naming of the bridge as the Duke-Fuqua Memorial Bridge in honor of Marine Sgt. Kenneth Duke and 2nd Lieut. John Edward Fuqua, two young men who died in military service in the Korean war and in Vietnam.  Forms part of Record Group 412, Photographs Collection. 1 photographic print, color; 3.5 x 3.5 in.</dc:description>
