<dc:title>Salvage scrap drive in Nashville and Middle Tennessee region, 1942 October</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pictured: &#8220;City schools make record key collection: the 100 per cent cooperation of the Junior Service Army of the Nashville Public Schools was recorded in the recent key collection drive.  Shown are the nearly 3,000 pounds of keys rounded up by the 5,000 Nashville school children in an intensive house-to-house canvass.  The keys are temporarily stored in the Bond-Sanders Paper Company and are being readied for shipment to a government refinery.  Shown with the keys are (left to right) J. C. Jones, A. J. Sanders, Edwin Sanders, and Page Sanders, Jr.  The local paper industry sponsored the recent drive with Page Sanders, Sr., as general chairman.  J. H. Cochran, chairman of the war steering committee in city schools, organized the Junior Service Army.&#8221; During World War II Americans were active with scrap drives to help the war effort.  Local communities were salvaging raw materials such as metal, rags, rubber, and paper to be used to supply troops.  These special home front war programs were often well-coordinated through committees that engaged widespread urban and rural participation and motivated patriotism and community spirit.
