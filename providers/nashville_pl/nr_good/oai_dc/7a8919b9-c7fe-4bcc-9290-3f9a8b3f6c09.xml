<dc:title>Letter from P.J. Williamson to his wife, Eunice, during the Civil War, 1862 October 07</dc:title>
<dc:description>A letter from Dutch immigrant, Peter J. Williamson back home to his wife, Eunice, during the Civil War.  In 1862, Williamson enlisted as a Private in the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, Company F and was ultimately promoted to Full 1st Lieutenant.  During the war, Williamson's regiment was involved in scouting and raids in Missouri and Arkansas and saw battle in the Middle Tennessee, Chickamauga, and Atlanta campaigns. In this letter, Williamson had just arrived in Greenville, Missouri, with his regiment.  He describes the trip to Greenville in great detail as pleasant and romantic.  He discusses eating hard breads and drinking coffee without milk, as well as picking delicious apples from an orchard on the way.  He suspects his unit will stay in Greenville three or four weeks.  Next Williamson discusses frustrations with the mail system and his clothing not arriving from Bloomfield yet.  He still doesn't know when exactly his unit will be mustered out and tells his wife that they will not know anything definite until they are paid, which will be in the next month.  He assures his wife that he is in good health and being faithful to her, unlike others of whom she has recently heard rumors.  Lastly he mentions that milk is much more expensive where he is now compared to the five cents per gallon he paid while at the Cape and gives Eunice his new address.  Forms part of the Peter J. Williamson Letters. 1 letter : col. ; 8  x 10  in.</dc:description>
