<dc:description>A letter from Dutch immigrant, Peter J. Williamson, back home to his wife, Eunice, during the Civil War.  In 1862 Williamson enlisted as a Private in the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, Company F and was ultimately promoted to Full 1st Lieutenant.  During the war, Williamson's regiment was involved in scouting and raids in Missouri and Arkansas and saw battle in the Middle Tennessee, Chickamauga, and Atlanta campaigns. In this letter from 5 miles east of Dalton, Georgia, Williamson writes to let Eunice know that he is doing well.  He provides details of a couple of engagements from the Atlanta campaign.  He describes it as their hardest campaign of the war and provides a description of their condition.  He tells her she must write often even if he is not able to.  He wishes her to be cheerful even in their separation and mentions that the muster officer has told him his time will be up the next December.  He closes by asking her to give his respects to their family and friends and expresses tenderness toward her and their boys. Forms part of the Peter J. Williamson Letters. 1 letter : col. ; 8  x 13  in.</dc:description>
