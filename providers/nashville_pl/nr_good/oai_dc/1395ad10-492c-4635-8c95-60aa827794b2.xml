<dc:title>Sunnyside Mansion, Nashville, Tennessee, circa 1986</dc:title>
<dc:description>An exterior view of the Sunnyside Mansion in Sevier Park, circa October, circa 1986.  The mansion was historically the home of  Mary Benton, widow of Jesse Benton who left Nashville after a famous feud with Andrew Jackson in 1813. The Greek Revival house was built c. 1852 and stood between Union and Confederate lines during the Battle of Nashville in 1864. Prominent dentist L. G. Noel lived here for 45 years. The brick wings were added by Col. Granville Sevier during renovation of the house in the late 1920s.&#8221; Sevier Park opened on this property in 1948. Sunnyside was occupied by the family of a Parks Department superintendent until 1987. A major restoration was completed in 2004, and Sunnyside became home to the Metropolitan Historical Commission and Metropolitan Historic Zoning Commission.  Forms part of the Bill Goodman Photographic Slides Collection.  1 35 mm negative.  </dc:description>
