<dc:description>A photograph showing two of the Nashville Public Library bookmobiles and drivers in  Nashville's Centennial Park, circa 1955. The Parthenon, originally built for Tennessee's 1897 Centennial Exposition, is pictured in the background. The bookmobile service in Davidson County, Tennessee originally began in the 1940's, when the State Library Project furnished a bookmobile which made weekly demonstration rounds through the county. In 1947, the Nashville Public Library initiated the "library-on-wheels" bookmobile service; by 1956, service had been extended to all of Davidson County. Approximately 3000 volumes were housed aboard the vehicle. Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph : b &amp; w ; 8 x 10 in.</dc:description>
