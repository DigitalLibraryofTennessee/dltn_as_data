<dc:description>The Duncan College Preparatory School was founded in 1908 by Marvin T. Duncan and operated by Mr. Duncan and his wife Pauline until 1952 when Mr. Duncan became too ill to maintain the school. In October 1952, Vanderbilt University acquired the Duncan School campus at 401 25th Avenue South, Nashville, Tennessee. Vanderbilt University demolished the Duncan School Building in 1958. </dc:description>
