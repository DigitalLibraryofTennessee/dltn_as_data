<dc:title>Church of God, 2001 December</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of the Church of God located at 1023 Third Avenue South, Nashville, Tennessee.  A church of many names, this church began in the 1940s as Church of the First Born.  In the 1960s the Nashville city directories record the name as ABC Pentecostal Church.  In the 1970s the name again changed to Church of God, finally changing to South Nashville Church of God in the 1980s which was the name at the time of this photograph in 2001.  The address is no longer listed in the Nashville city directory.  At the time this survey was conducted, the foundation was concrete block.  The exterior walls were made of wood siding.  The roof was gabled with tar shingles.  The windows were square with frosted glass panes.  The doors were modern glass with metal frames and bars.  Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4  x 6  in.</dc:description>
