<dc:title>The Church of the Assumption, 2001 November 17</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of Church of the Assumption, now referred to as Assumption Church located at 1227 Seventh Avenue North in Nashville Tennessee.  The original street address was 1225 Seventh Avenue North.  Assumption Church is Nashville's second oldest Catholic church.  It was dedicated in 1859.  Father Vogel, together with Jacob Geiger, a master builder and stonecutter in Nashville, is said to have designed the original brick church structure.  The rectory was added in 1874 and the school was added in 1879.  The present altar, windows, and steeple were added later.  Since the Germantown neighborhood was growing around it, most sermons were said in German until World War I.  The foundation is made of rough cut stone and concrete.  The exterior walls are red brick.  The roof is made of pressed copper.  The windows include stained glass.  The doors are made of various woods.  The double doors on the front facade include ornate Gothic architectural details.  This church building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.  Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4  x 6  in.</dc:description>
