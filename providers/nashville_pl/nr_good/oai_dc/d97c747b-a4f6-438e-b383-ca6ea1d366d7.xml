<dc:title>The Hermitage, home of President Andrew Jackson, near Nashville, Tenn., between 1930 and 1945</dc:title>
<dc:description>A postcard showing the front elevation of the Hermitage, home of Andrew Jackson located twelve miles from Nashville in Hermitage, Tennessee.  The architecture is colonial, the verandas are wide and long and the rooms inside are large and spacious.  The original Hermitage was built of logs in 1804.  The present mansion was built in 1819.  Architectural details include a classic Greek Revival facade, with six Doric columns and a portico at the entrance. Andrew Jackson and his wife are buried on the grounds.  In 1889 the Hermitage opened as a museum, and it continues to operate as one today under the leadership of the Ladies Hermitage Association.  In 1966 the Hermitage was added to the National Registry of Historic Places.  Forms part of the Norton Postcard Collection. 1 postcard : col. ; 3.5  x 5.5  in.</dc:description>
