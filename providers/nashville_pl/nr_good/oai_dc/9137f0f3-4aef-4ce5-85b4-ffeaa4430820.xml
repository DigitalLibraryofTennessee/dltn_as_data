<dc:title>Portrait of Francis K.W. Drury, 1965</dc:title>
<dc:description>Francis K. W. Drury in middle age, balding, with glasses.  He is wearing a blue suit.  Born in New York in 1878, Francis K.W. Drury was educated at Rutgers and the University of Illinois.  He held various library positions from 1899 until 1929, when he began working for the American Library Association in Chicago.  In 1907, Drury married Martha Blanche Walker in Evanston, Illinois.  Drury came to Nashville to serve as Carnegie Librarian in 1931, a position he held until his retirement in July 1946.  He was the author of numerous reading lists and was very active in professional library associations.  He was also active in Nashville's Community Playhouse.  His son, John Benjamin Drury, served as City Editor of the Nashville Banner.  Drury died in Nashville in 1954.  Oil on canvas.  The portrait is currently on display in the Nashville Room on the Nashville Public Library's second floor.  

The library's portraits were photographed as part of the National Society of The Colonial Dames of America in Tennessee's Tennessee Portrait Project (http://www.tnportraits.org/index.htm).  </dc:description>
