<dc:title>Inglewood Baptist Church, 2002 January</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of Inglewood Baptist Church located at 3901 Gallatin Pike in Nashville, Tennessee.  This congregation was established in 1923 and began meeting in a small home on Shelton Avenue.  In the late 1920s the congregation began meeting on Gallatin Pike (then called Gallatin Road) in what was referred to as the Basement Church, (a basement auditorium on the lot where Inglewood's present auditorium is located).  Today Inglewood Baptist Church stands on that same property.  The foundation is made of rough cut stone blocks.  The exterior walls are red brick.  The roof is gabled and hipped with tar shingles.  The windows are arched and contain colored glass.  Other features include a steeple and a front porch with four columns.  A clock is set into each of the tower's four sides.  Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4  x 6  in.</dc:description>
