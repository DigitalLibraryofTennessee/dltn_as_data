<dc:title>Historical marker &#8220;Votes for Women,&#8221; Nashville, Tennessee, 2016 September 14</dc:title>
<dc:description>An historical marker, located in downtown Nashville at Union Street and Capitol Boulevard, commemorating the ratification of the 19th Amendment granting women the right to vote.  The marker reads: &#8220;Votes For Women, On August 18, 1920, Tennessee became the 36th state to ratify the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, thereby giving all American women the right to vote.  After weeks of intense lobbying by national leaders, Tennessee passed the measure by one vote. The headquarters for both suffragists, wearing yellow roses, and anti-suffragists., wearing red roses, were in the Hermitage Hotel.  This marker was erected in 1995 through the Historical Commission of Metropolitan Nashville and Davidson County.  It was donated &#8220;in memory of Carleen S. Waller.&#8221; The historical marker program to commemorate significant people, places, and events in the city&#8217;s past was initiated in 1967 by the newly-formed Metropolitan Historical Commission of Nashville and Davidson County.  Forms part of the Leanne Garland Photograph Collection.  1 digital photograph.  </dc:description>
