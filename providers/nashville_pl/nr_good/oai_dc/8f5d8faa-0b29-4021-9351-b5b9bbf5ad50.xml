<dc:title>Letter from P.J. Williamson to his wife, Eunice, during the Civil War, 1865 September 07</dc:title>
<dc:description>A letter from Dutch immigrant, Peter J. Williamson, back home to his wife, Eunice, during the Civil War.  In 1862 Williamson enlisted as a Private in the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, Company F and was ultimately promoted to Full 1st Lieutenant.  During the war, Williamson's regiment was involved in scouting and raids in Missouri and Arkansas and saw battle in the Middle Tennessee, Chickamauga, and Atlanta campaigns. In this letter from Nashville, Tennessee, Williamson describes in detail his boarding situation and the boarding house he is lodging in, including its location on Front Street in relation to Market Street and the Cumberland River.  He dislikes the area though for their family and hopes to find a house for them in a better location.  He reports food prices for a number of items and tells Eunice he has been feeling miserably.  He mentions a friend in Louisville and that he is unaware of the location of Captain Seaton and his wife.  He then discusses his sketch of his current boarding house located on the second page of the letter.  He closes by including his current address and telling Eunice that his hand hurts too much to continue writing.  Forms part of the Peter J. Williamson Letters. 1 letter : col. ; 8 x 10 in.</dc:description>
