<dc:description>A photograph of Inglewood United Methodist Church located at 3511 Gallatin Pike in Nashville, Tennessee.  According to the cornerstone, the congregation was founded in 1924.  The sanctuary was completed in 1939.  The foundation is made of rough cut stone blocks with smooth cut capstones.  The exterior walls are red brick with stone accents at the corners and above the windows.  The roof is gabled and hipped.  Some windows are arched with colored glass.  Others are tall and narrow with a combination of frosted and clear glass.  The doors are wooden.  A pipe organ was built for the church in 1939 but it was removed during the 1954-1955 remodeling.
