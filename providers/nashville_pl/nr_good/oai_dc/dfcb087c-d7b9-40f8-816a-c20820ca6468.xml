<dc:title>Letter from P.J. Williamson to his wife, Eunice, during the Civil War, 1863 March 04</dc:title>
<dc:description>A letter from Dutch immigrant Peter J. Williamson back home to his wife, Eunice, during the Civil War.  In 1862, Williamson enlisted as a Private in the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, Company F and was ultimately promoted to Full 1st Lieutenant.  During the war, Williamson's regiment was involved in scouting and raids in Missouri and Arkansas and saw battle in the Middle Tennessee, Chickamauga, and Atlanta campaigns. In this letter from St. Genevieve, Missouri, Williamson discusses the possibility of Eunice and their children coming to visit him in Missouri.  He reports on how much the train fare would be for each of them and says he will send for her if he is paid again in the next two months.  He reiterates that he never wants her to have to work, and that when she needs more money she is to let him know.  Forms part of the Peter J. Williamson Letters. 1 letter : col. ; 8 x 10 in.</dc:description>
