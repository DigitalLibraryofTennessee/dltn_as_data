<dc:title>Letter from P.J. Williamson to his wife, Eunice, during the Civil War, 1862 May 18</dc:title>
<dc:description>A letter from Dutch immigrant, Peter J. Williamson back home to his wife, Eunice, during the Civil War.  In 1862, Williamson enlisted as a Private in the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, Company F and was ultimately promoted to Full 1st Lieutenant.  During the war, Williamson's regiment was involved in scouting and raids in Missouri and Arkansas and saw battle in the Middle Tennessee, Chickamauga, and Atlanta campaigns. In this letter from Bloomfield, Missouri, Williamson takes time to explain the happenings in his regiment.  He discusses their strenuous march to Bloomfield and mentions a large feast they had for dinner after a particularly long leg of the journey without food.  Upon arriving in Bloomfield his regiment took over an abandoned rebel camp.  Several prisoners were captured.  Williamson also reports that the mosquitoes and blackflies are especially bothersome and comments that he has not seen a single schoolhouse, and only one church, in these parts of Missouri.  He ends by giving an update on a battle that happened at Chalk Bluff, Arkansas, where 600 of their men encountered 300 rebels, killing 15 and wounding 20.  He mentions he received the pictures that Eunice sent and assures her that they give him courage to press on.  Forms part of the Peter J. Williamson Letters. 1 letter : col. ; 9.75 x 7.5 in.</dc:description>
