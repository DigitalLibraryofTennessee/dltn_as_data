<dc:title>Salvage scrap drive in Nashville and Middle Tennessee region, 1942 October</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pictured: &#8220;Cannon balls donated: these six-inch, solid cast-iron cannon balls, Civil War relics recovered from construction work on the old National Casket Company factory, on the site now occupied by the Tennessee Central Railway Station, are to be sent to the Japs and Germans with the compliments of Frank C. Guthrie, manager of the casket company.  Records show that these cannon balls were fired from Confederate Hill, the highest point in East Nashville, formerly known as Edgefield, at Federal gun boats tied up at the foot of Broadway.  Although they are historic mementoes, Gutherie is donating them to the Banner scrap drive.&#8221;  During World War II Americans were active with scrap drives to help the war effort.  Local communities were salvaging raw materials such as metal, rags, rubber, and paper to be used to supply troops.  These special home front war programs were often well-coordinated through committees that engaged widespread urban and rural participation and motivated patriotism and community spirit.  Forms part of Record Group 412, Photographs Collection. 1 photograph negative : b &amp; w ; 4 x 5 in.</dc:description>
