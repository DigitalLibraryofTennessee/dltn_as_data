<dc:title>Aerial photograph of North Nashville, ca. 1968.</dc:title>
<dc:description>Aerial photograph of North Nashville, looking west, circa 1968, taken by Metro Photographer, William M. King. Photograph shows a wooded residential area and fields in the background that could be part of Buena Vista Park, with what appears to be lowlands bordering the Cumberland River on the right of the image. Streets identified on the photograph include Clay Street and 3rd Ave. North. Not marked but visible in the image are Cass St. one block to the right of Clay; Coffee St. intersecting 3rd Ave North on the bottom left of the image, and 4th Ave. North one block above 3rd Avenue in the image. Most buildings are too small and distant to be clearly discerned or are obscured by trees. Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph : b &amp; w ; 8 x 10 in.</dc:description>
