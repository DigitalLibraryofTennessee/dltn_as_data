<dc:title>The Insane Asylum of Tenn., circa 1859</dc:title>
<dc:description>A page from a mounted and bound volume of twenty-five pen-and-ink wash drawings, and two pen-and-ink maps of Nashville created by William A. Eichbaum during the 1850s.  Eichbaum was a Nashville bookseller and resident for fifty years.  This page shows a drawing of the Tennessee Hospital for the Insane in Nashville, Tennessee.  This building opened in 1851 after Dorthea Dix, a social reformer for the treatment of the mentally ill, prompted the state legislature to move the care center from its inadequate quarters at Twelfth Avenue South and Division Street .  The new hospital site contained 455 acres of land, six miles from the downtown center of Nashville, on the Murfreesboro Turnpike.  The hospital structure was erected in the castellated style.  The center, far right, and far left portions of the building were four stories high, while the intervening ranges and wings were three stories high.  Twenty-four octagonal towers were also part of the construction.  This building remained the home of the asylum from 1851 to 1995. During that period it underwent several changes of name, becoming first the Tennessee Hospital for the Insane, then, upon incorporation with the developing system of state mental hospitals, Central Hospital for the Insane, and finally Middle Tennessee Mental Health Institute.  Forms part of the William A. Eichbaum Sketchbook. 1 drawing : col. ; 5.75  x 9  in.</dc:description>
