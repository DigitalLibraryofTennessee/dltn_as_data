<dc:title>Fort Negley reproduced in Nashville on original site, Nashville, Tennessee, 1944</dc:title>
<dc:description>A postcard of a reproduction of Fort Negley on its original site approximately two miles south of downtown Nashville, Tennessee.  Built during the Civil War after Union troops gained occupation of Nashville in 1862, Fort Negley was constructed using the labor of newly freed African Americans.  The star-shaped fort is built out of limestone.  Construction was overseen by Captain James St. Clair Morton, and the finished structure was named after Union Army commander, General James S. Negley.  Shortly after the war the fort was abandoned.  In 1930 the Works Progress Administration (WPA) made a project to begin restoration of Fort Negley.  Due to the start of World War II the project was put on hold for a while. The fort officially reopened to the public in 2004.  Forms part of the Norton Postcard Collection. 1 postcard : col. ; 3.5  x 5.5  in.</dc:description>
