<dc:title>West End Synagogue, 2001 February</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of West End Synagogue located at 3810 West End Avenue in Nashville, Tennessee.  Constructed in 1950, this synagogue is home to Nashville's second oldest Jewish congregation which was established in 1874 by 20 Jewish families.  The original name of the congregation was Khal Kodesh Adath Israel, Congregation Assembly of Israel.  The members met for years in various public halls before buying a house at 417 North Market Street, now Second Avenue North.  Later property was found for a synagogue on Gay Street, where the congregation stayed for 46 years.  The current synagogue has undergone major renovations over the years.  The exterior walls are brick with stone insets.  The roof is flat.  The windows are large, square and stained in the main sanctuary, with some clear glass throughout the rest of the building.  The doors are both metal and wood.  Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4  x 6  in.</dc:description>
