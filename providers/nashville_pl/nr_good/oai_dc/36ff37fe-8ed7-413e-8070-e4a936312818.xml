<dc:title>Business Automation Systems, 2002 January</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of the former Craig Memorial Methodist Church located at 530 Twenty-sixth Avenue North, Nashville, Tennessee.  This building has seen many uses over time since its construction in 1926.  Originally the structure served as the church for the Craig Memorial Methodist congregation.  Sometime in the 1960s the Walls Tabernacle AME Zion Church began meeting there.  In the 1990s, the structure housed the Davis Stokes Chilton Architects firm.  At the time of this survey and photograph, the building was serving as an office for the Business Automation Systems company.  Currently the building is being used for Friends Meeting, a Nashville-based Quaker affiliated group.  The foundation of the structure is comprised of rough cut stone blocks.  The exterior walls are red brick.  The roof is gabled and hipped and made of tar shingles.  The windows have clear glass panes.  The doors are a combination of wood and glass.  Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4  x 6  in.</dc:description>
