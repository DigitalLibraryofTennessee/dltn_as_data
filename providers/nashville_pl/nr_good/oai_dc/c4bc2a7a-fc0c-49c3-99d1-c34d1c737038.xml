<dc:description>An excerpt from an oral history interview with Nashville minister Dr. Frank F. Drowota, Jr., conducted on 20 November 1980 by Helen Drowota as part of the Century III Nashville: Nashville Heritage Project.  Drowota, a native of England and the founding minister of Nashville's Woodmont Christian Church, discusses the death of England's King Edward VII and how, when viewing the King's body at Westminster Abbey at the age of six, he realized for the first time the meaning of death.  He discusses how this affected him throughout his life and ministry.  The complete interview, as well as an index, is available in the repository.</dc:description>
