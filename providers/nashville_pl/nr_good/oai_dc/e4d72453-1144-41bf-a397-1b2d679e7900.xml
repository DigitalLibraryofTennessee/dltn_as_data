<dc:title>Wharton Elementary School, Nashville, Tennessee, circa 1950</dc:title>
<dc:description>An exterior view of Wharton Elementary School in North Nashville, circa 1950.  The school was named for Arthur Dickson Wharton (1840-1900), scholar, Confederate naval hero, and educator.  The school building was located at 1515 18th Avenue N in North Nashville.  In 1959 a new school facility was built a block away, to accommodate 800 students in grades 1-9, replacing the original structure which had housed grades 1-4.  The enrollment would further increase, with building expansion. The original building was later demolished.
