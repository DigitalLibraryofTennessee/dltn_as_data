<dc:title>Private John Knopp of Co. F, 1st Tennessee Volunteers, Camp Merritt, San Francisco, 1898</dc:title>
<dc:description>A studio portrait (seated) of a Nashville soldier, Private John Knopp of the 1st Tennessee Volunteers, 1898 at Camp Merritt, California. The card index identifies the soldier as "John Knopp," while the Knopp surname referenced in the regimental history: "The First Tennessee Regiment, United States Volunteers" by Will T. (Will Thomas) Hale (published in Nashville in 1889) cites a "C. W. Knopp," on the list of non-commissioned officers and privates of Company F. The First Tennessee Regiment was mustered into federal service in Nashville circa May, 1898. Selected by the War Department for service in the Philippines during the Spanish-American War, the regiment went to San Francisco where the men first trained at Camp Merritt for four months. They were sent late in 1898 as reinforcements to hold the Philippine Islands that the United States had newly acquired from Spain. The First Tennessee participated in the fighting that erupted in Manila in February 1899. The regiment took an important part in the capture of Iloilo, the second largest city in the Philippines. The First Tennessee Infantry was mustered out of service in San Francisco on November 22, 1901 as one of the most honored of the Spanish-American War state volunteer regiments. Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph : sepia ; 4 x 5.5 in.</dc:description>
