<dc:title>Aerial view of the strike at Neuhoff Packing Plant, 1937 June 29</dc:title>
<dc:description>An aerial view of the June 29th, 1937 strike at the Neuhoff Meat Packing Plant.  The company was first built circa 1906 in North Nashville, by German immigrant Henry Neuhoff.  It was located six blocks from the Tennessee State Capitol, on a rock bluff overlooking the Cumberland River. The buildings were erected between 1906 and 1950, expanding to a 700,000 square-foot complex.  In the early 1930s, it became a Swift &amp; Co. subsidiary in the meat packing industry and closed in 1977.  The Neuhoff Building is located at 1315 Adams Street, redesigned as a mixed-use development in East Germantown. Forms part of Record Group 412, Photographs Collection. 1 photograph negative : b &amp; w ; 4 x 5 in.</dc:description>
