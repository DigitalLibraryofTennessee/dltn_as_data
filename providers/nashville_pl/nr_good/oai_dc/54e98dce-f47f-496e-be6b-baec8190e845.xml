<dc:title>St. Thomas Sanitarium, Nashville, Tenn., 1910</dc:title>
<dc:description>A postcard of the early St. Thomas Hospital, sometimes referred to as St. Thomas Sanitarium.  The hospital is named for its founder, Bishop Thomas S. Byrne of Nashville.  In 1898 he bought a mansion home in a residential West End neighborhood on Church Street between Twentieth and Twenty-first Avenues and converted it into a hospital.  Four years later, in 1902, the hospital building pictured on this card was constructed for $200,000 to meet their growing needs.  The mansion is partially visible behind the hospital.  The hospital was made of red brick and had arched roof gardens on either end of the building.  In 1974 the current building opened on Harding Road, and by 1975 the old St. Thomas Hospital was torn down to make way for a Baptist Hospital parking lot.  Forms part of the Norton Postcard Collection. 1 postcard : col. ; 3.5  x 5.5  in.</dc:description>
