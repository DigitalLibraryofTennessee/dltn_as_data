<dc:title>Oral history interview with E.W. "Bud" Wendell, 2007 June 22</dc:title>
<dc:description>Excerpts from an oral history interview with Nashville business and civic leader E.W. "Bud" Wendell, conducted on 22 June 2007 by Cabot Pyle as part of the Nashville Public Library's Nashville Business Leaders Oral History Project:  The Turner Interviews.  In the excerpts, Wendell discusses his early career as a Shield Man with National Life and Accident Life Insurance and how the Grand Ole Opry was a promotional sales tool in the community; the clear channel radio station WSM; upheaval in the Opry family and an exodus of entertainers circa the late 1950s; the origin of the moniker "Music City USA"; and the variety of WSM radio programming that included classical music, an on-air topical program scripted by Bill Williams with Barbara Moore, Teddy Bart, and Larry Munson and presentations to audiences at the churches of Mr. Craig and Mr. Wills; the necessity for the Grand Ole Opry's move from the Ryman Auditorium; and Irving Waugh's creative idea for the development of Opryland.  The complete interview, as well as an index, is available in the Special Collections Division.</dc:description>
