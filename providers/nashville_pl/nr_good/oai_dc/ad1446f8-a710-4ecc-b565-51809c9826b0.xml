<dc:description>A photograph of the Education and Hygiene Building at the Tennessee Centennial and International Exposition, circa 1897. This non-extant structure was built for the celebration of Tennessee's 100th year of statehood that opened May 1, 1897, at Nashville's Centennial Park (2814 West End Avenue), and continued for six months, closing on October 31, 1897. The formal celebration of Tennessee's 100th birthday occurred on June 1, 1896, with a grand inaugural day parade commemorating the centennial anniversary of Tennessee's statehood (Tennessee was admitted to the Union in 1796 as the 16th state). The Tennessee Centennial Exposition was a great success and drew approximately 1.8 million visitors. This building featured exhibits dedicated to the progress of higher education with displays by educational institutions such as Vanderbilt and the University of Tennessee. Another area of the building featured surgical and medical instruments and articles pertaining to hygiene and sanitary appliances. Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph, mounted : sepia ; 4.25 x 5.5 in.</dc:description>
