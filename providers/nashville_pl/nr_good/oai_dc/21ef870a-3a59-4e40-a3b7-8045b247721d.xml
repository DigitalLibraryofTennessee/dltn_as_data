<dc:title>Photograph of the Chamber of Commerce building in Nashville, Tennessee, circa 1960s</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of the Romanesque building, located at 315 Fourth Avenue North, Nashville, Tennessee that housed the Vanderbilt Law Department and part of the Vanderbilt School of Dentistry in the late 1800's and early 1900's. By 1919, an addition was completed, when it became the site of the Commercial Club and subsequently the Nashville Chamber of Commerce, which occupied the building for a span of decades. There was a Business Branch of the Carnegie Library at the Chamber of Commerce building that officially opened in 1931. The Chamber of Commerce occupied several addresses over the decades, in the downtown central business district, while both departments of Vanderbilt moved to the main campus, west of the city. The building no longer exists, as it was razed to make way for a hotel. Photographed by the Nashville architect Charles Wesley Warterfield, Jr. (1926-1998); the architectural photograph forms part of the Charles Warterfield Architectural Collection. Gift of: The Estate of Charles W. Warterfield, Jr., F. A. I. A. The original is a 35 mm color transparency (2 x 2 in. slide mount)</dc:description>
