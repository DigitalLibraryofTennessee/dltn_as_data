Pictured in the photograph are some students at Central High School who have furnished the turkeys served at the annual holiday affair for the past 20 years, and some officials at the home board and their husbands.  Left to right they are William Baucom, Miss Stella Jennette and Miss Annie Mai Alred, all Central students, James V. Blevins, Mrs. Blevins, president of the social workers, Mrs. Frank Drowota, president-elect, and Dr. Drowota."
