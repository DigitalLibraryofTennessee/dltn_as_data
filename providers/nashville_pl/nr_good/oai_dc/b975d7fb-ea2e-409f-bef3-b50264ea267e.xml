<dc:title>Letter from P.J. Williamson to his wife, Eunice, during the Civil War, 1864 August 27</dc:title>
<dc:description>A letter from Dutch immigrant, Peter J. Williamson, back home to his wife, Eunice, during the Civil War.  In 1862 Williamson enlisted as a Private in the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, Company F and was ultimately promoted to Full 1st Lieutenant.  During the war, Williamson's regiment was involved in scouting and raids in Missouri and Arkansas and saw battle in the Middle Tennessee, Chickamauga, and Atlanta campaigns. In this letter from Cartersville, Georgia, Williamson asks Eunice to date her letters and include the dates that she receives his in her replies.  He mentions that nothing has changed since their last and reports that the railroad from Chattanooga to the front is open.  He tells her of an upcoming recruitment drive for cavalry soldiers in Wisconsin to replace those that will be discharged soon.  He relates a conversation between he and Colonel La Grange about her and expresses his love and his satisfaction with her affections.  In closing he describes the enclosed map of McCook's Raid he drew, pointing out some highlights including how to trace their path for the raid and their escape route.  Forms part of the Peter J. Williamson Letters. 1 letter : col. ; 8  x 10  in.  1 map : col. ; 16 x 10.</dc:description>
