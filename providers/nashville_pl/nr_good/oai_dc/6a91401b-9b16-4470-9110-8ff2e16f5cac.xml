<dc:title>Mayor West with proclamation for Nashville Vols at Sulphur Dell, 1957 April 11</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pictured: Nashville Mayor Ben West reading an honorary proclamation with Nashville Vols team players on April 11th, 1957 at the Sulphur Dell ballpark.  In 1957, former major-leaguer Dick Sisler assumed command of the team, and the Vols finished in third place in the Southern Association.  Sisler was a player-manager and batted .332 while playing first base.  Robert Kelly won 24 games to lead the league after leading the league in losses the previous season.  The Sulphur Dell Historical Marker reads: &#8220;Nashville&#8217;s first (1885) professional baseball was played in the Athletic Park which formerly occupied this block.  Traditionally baseball was introduced in Nashville in 1862 by soldiers of the Union army of occupation who played the game here.  This low-lying area, originally called Sulphur Spring Bottom, was first called &#8220;Sulphur Dell&#8221; by local sports writer, Grantland Rice.  In 1963 this was the oldest playing grounds still in use in professional baseball.  Sulphur Dell was demolished in 1969. A new ballpark is currently under construction in the general vicinity of Sulphur Dell and will be the new home of the Nashville Sounds of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League.
