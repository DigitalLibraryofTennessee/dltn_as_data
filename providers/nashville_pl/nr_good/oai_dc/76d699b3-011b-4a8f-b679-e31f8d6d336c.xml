<dc:title>Mayor West speaking at the Farmers&#8217; Market, 1954 September</dc:title>
<dc:description>Mayor Ben West speaking at the Farmers&#8217; Market, September, 1954.  Since its inception on the town square in the early 1800&#8217;s, the Farmers&#8217; Market has been a vital part of Nashville life. There have been several venues, for example in the early 1800&#8217;s Nashville constructed a new City Hall and Market House on the west side of the downtown public square. During the 1930&#8217;s, the City Hall, Market House and Courthouse Buildings were demolished to make way for the new Davidson County Courthouse and a new Market House was constructed on the north side of the square.  In the mid-1950&#8217;s the City moved the Farmers&#8217; Market to a new location just north of Downtown on Jefferson Street. In 1995, the Farmers&#8217; Market was renovated as part of the Bicentennial State Park Mall development.  The address of the Farmers&#8217; Market is 900 Rosa L. Parks Boulevard.
