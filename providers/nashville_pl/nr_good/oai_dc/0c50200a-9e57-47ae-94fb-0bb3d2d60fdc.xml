<dc:title>Jordonia United Methodist Church, 2000 October</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of Jordonia United Methodist Church located at 4225 Cato Road in Nashville, Tennessee.  Built in approximately 1920, this church was nominated for an Architectural Award in the 1975 awards program sponsored by Metropolitan Historical Commission.  The foundation is made of stone.  The majority of the exterior walls are covered in clapboard, while the upper half of the front fa&#231;ade is covered by patterned shingling.  It has a high, steep pitched standing seam tin roof.  There are 18 decorative stained glass windows.  Special features include a bell tower, a steeple, arches, and a parish house addition covered in the same clapboard making it architecturally compatible with the original building.
