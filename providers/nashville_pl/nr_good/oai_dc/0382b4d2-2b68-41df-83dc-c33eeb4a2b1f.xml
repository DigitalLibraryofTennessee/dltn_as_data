<dc:title>The Parthenon, First American National Bank building, Nashville, circa 1950</dc:title>
<dc:description>A postcard showing drawings of the Parthenon and the First American National Bank Building.  The Parthenon, located in Centennial Park, is a reproduction of the Greek Athenian Temple.  This full scale replica was originally constructed out of wood, plaster and brick as a temporary exhibit for the Tennessee Centennial Exposition in 1897.  A permanent version of Parthenon was constructed out of concrete in 1921-1931 to replace the one built for the exposition.  The Nashville Parthenon underwent major renovations in 1991-2001. It now serves as a museum and art gallery and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.  The First American National Bank Building, located at 326 Union Street, was built in 1926, with the largest concrete beams ever used in Nashville to support the floors above. The building was razed in 1973.  Forms part of the Nashville Room Postcard Collection. 1 postcard : col. ; 3.5  x 5.5  in.</dc:description>
