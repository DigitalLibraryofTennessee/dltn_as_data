Having served as field representative for the Fellowship of Reconciliation, Reverend Lawson was the key organizer and instructor in passive resistance techniques and nonviolent strategies for the Nashville Student Movement. While leading the Nashville Movement, Reverend Lawson stated that it was his hope that the sit-in demonstrations in Nashville would "end segregation and evil social injustice."

It was under the encouragement of Dr. King that James Lawson came to Nashville to help organize a nonviolent movement.
