<dc:title>Khruschev's position on Cuba, circa 1962</dc:title>
<dc:description>An original political cartoon created by Jack Knox, the Nashville Banner editorial cartoonist from the mid-1940s to the early 1970s.  This caricature depicts Soviet Union Premier Nikita Khrushchev standing atop Cuba in the Caribbean, while holding onto ropes labeled "U.S. lifelines to the Panama Canal, So. American raw materials-oil."  A grinning Khruschev holds a hammer and sickle in his right hand and below him at his heel is a dwarfed Fidel Castro who is smoking a cigar.  In October 1962, President Kennedy imposed an arms blockade on Cuba in response to the construction of missile bases in Cuba by the Soviet Union.  The Cuban Missile Crisis almost led to a nuclear war between the United States and USSR when Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev responded defiantly at the height of the crisis.  Forms part of the Jack Knox Political Cartoon Collection. 1 original cartoon drawing : b &amp; w ; 14 x 20 in.</dc:description>
