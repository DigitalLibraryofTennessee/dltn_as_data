<dc:title>Mt. Nebo Baptist Church, 2001 May</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of Mt. Nebo Baptist Church located at 2416 Clifton Avenue in Nashville, Tennessee.  This congregation was founded in 1871 by Rev. Pharoah Benson, a former slave.  The first church was built right across the street from the present day location.  In 1882 the structure was destroyed by fire and was moved to the present location under the supervision of Rev. F. M. Merry, who laid the foundation for the New Mt. Nebo in 1883.  This was a frame building.  Soon the construction of a brick edifice began, making it a one story building.  In 1916 a new wing was built giving more seating capacity to the main auditorium.  A new sanctuary was built in 1964 and replaced again in 1984.  Today the foundation is made of concrete.  The exterior walls are concrete with stucco finish.  The building style is modern.  The roof is metal.  The windows are clear glass.  The doors are metal with glass panels.  Special features include a small steeple and a colored glass cross on the front facade.  Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4  x 6  in.</dc:description>
