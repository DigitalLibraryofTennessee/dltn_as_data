<dc:title>Cain-Sloan Department Store opening ceremonies, 1957 October 25</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of the opening of Cain-Sloan Department Store's new facility. A crowd of more than 500 persons stood in the early morning chill on Church Street to hear John Sloan, president of Cain-Sloan Co., officially open the firm's new $12,000,000 department store on the southwest corner of Fifth Avenue North and Church Street in downtown Nashville, Tennessee. In this photograph only a partial view of John Sloan is visible; he is seated behind the speaker. The store opened at 9:30 a.m. and an estimated over 32,000 shoppers and visitors had passed through its doors by 9:00 p.m. that evening. Many items were sold out during the first day. The Jackson building had earlier stood on this site and was demolished to make way for the new Cain-Sloan building.  Forms part of the Nashville Banner Archives. 1 photograph negative : b &amp; w ; 3.25 x 4.25 in.</dc:description>
