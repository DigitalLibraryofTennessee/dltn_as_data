<dc:title>Letter from P.J. Williamson to his wife, Eunice, during the Civil War, 1865 May 08</dc:title>
<dc:description>A letter from Dutch immigrant, Peter J. Williamson, back home to his wife, Eunice, during the Civil War.  In 1862 Williamson enlisted as a Private in the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, Company F and was ultimately promoted to Full 1st Lieutenant.  During the war, Williamson's regiment was involved in scouting and raids in Missouri and Arkansas and saw battle in the Middle Tennessee, Chickamauga, and Atlanta campaigns. In this letter from Nashville, Tennessee, Williamson wishes he were there to care for Eunice as she is not feeling well.  He reports that government business is slowing in Nashville as the war ends including the discharge of certain types of personnel.  He predicts the closing of his department and is unsure of his future.  Captain Irvin is set to be transferred, possibly to Richmond and Peter does not wish to go unless he can take Eunice with him.  He hopes though to stay in Nashville as he predicts it will be a good place to be after the war.  He then relates the status of friends including Captain Seaton and his wife.  He describes a horse ride in Edgefield and briefly discusses some issues involving family and friends back in Wisconsin.  He inquires of business conditions in Oshkosh and Appleton.  Williamson reports that Captain Seaton has been ordered to Dalton, Georgia and a recruiting officer has been enlisting soldiers for Mexico although he is not interested.  He closes by wishing to send her a present and in a post script hopes that she gets well soon.  Forms part of the Peter J. Williamson Letters. 1 letter : col. ; 8 x 10 in.</dc:description>
