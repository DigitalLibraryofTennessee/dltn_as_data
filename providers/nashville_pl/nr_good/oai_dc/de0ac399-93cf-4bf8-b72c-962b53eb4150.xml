<dc:title>Frozen Cumberland River, from the Nashville Times, 1940</dc:title>
<dc:description>A captioned photo from the Nashville Times (1940), about the frozen ice covering the river. The caption reads: &#8220;Hundreds of Nashvillians walked across the frozen surface of Cumberland River here Saturday, as shown in this view at the foot of Broad Street. Police were unable to hold back the crowds, eliminated &#8216;the danger of mass drowning by steaming a tugboat through the ice, and keeping it broken up throughout.&#8221; Forms part of the Nashville Times newspaper collection. 1 digital photo.</dc:description>
