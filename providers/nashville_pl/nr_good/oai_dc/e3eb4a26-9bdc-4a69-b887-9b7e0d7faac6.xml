<dc:title>Salvage scrap drive in Nashville and Middle Tennessee region, 1942</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pictured: &#8220;Tom Joy School builds lofty scrap pile: the students at Tom Joy School, among the first groups to enter the Banner scrap contest, are determined to win one of the special prizes for schools, announced today, as evidenced by their extensive collection of boilers, pipes, and other odd pieces of metal.  Shown with the scrap pile are James Snyder, George Rooker, Frances Lynch, Harry Oglesby, Betty Sue Rawls, Homer Chance Merrill Patterson, Mary Lou Patterson, Charles Kemp, Joe Ann Kerr, Wallace Boswell, Joe Gebhardt, Alvin Vanhook, Gilbert Edison and G. D. Alexander.&#8221;  During World War II Americans were active with scrap drives to help the war effort.  Local communities were salvaging raw materials such as metal, rags, rubber, and paper to be used to supply troops.  These special home front war programs were often well-coordinated through committees that engaged widespread urban and rural participation and motivated patriotism and community spirit.
