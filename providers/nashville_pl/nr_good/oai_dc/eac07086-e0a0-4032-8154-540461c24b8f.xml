<dc:title>Volunteers assist with a water rescue in Bellevue during the May 2010 flood</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of volunteers assisting with a rescue in Bellevue during the May 2010 Nashville flood.
Photo text reads: &#8220;Volunteers came from 5-10 mi away. I recognize only 2 or 3 neighbors in this photo. Lord knows where the boat came from. We never saw any of these folks again and still don&#8217;t know who they are or where they came from.&#8221;
