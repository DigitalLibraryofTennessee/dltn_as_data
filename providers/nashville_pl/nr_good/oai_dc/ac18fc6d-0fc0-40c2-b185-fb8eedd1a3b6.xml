<dc:title>Aerial photograph of interstate construction in West Nashville, ca. 1968</dc:title>
<dc:description>Aerial photograph of West Nashville, looking west, circa 1968, taken by Metro Photographer, William M. King. The image shows Interstate 40 under construction, with ground cleared and leveled, dirt roadway in place, and some bridges and overpasses already constructed. A portion of the interstate in the left distance may already be complete, dating this photograph to sometime after 1965 and before 1970. Streets identified on the photograph include: Delaware Avenue, Alabama Avenue, 46th Avenue North, and 40th Avenue North. Most buildings are too small and distant to be clearly discerned, or are obscured by trees. Industrial areas near the foreground on both sides of the interstate are clearly visible. The round structure in the center lower edge of the photograph is a water pump station and a large antenna is just to its left. Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph : b &amp; w ; 8 x 10 in.</dc:description>
