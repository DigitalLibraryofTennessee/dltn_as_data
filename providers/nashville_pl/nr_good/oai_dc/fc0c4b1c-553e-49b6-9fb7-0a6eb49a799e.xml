<dc:title>Glimpses of Nashville Tennessee: Tennessee State Capitol </dc:title>
<dc:description>The Tennessee State Capitol building.  The State Capitol was constructed between 1845 and 1859. It was designed in Greek Revival style by architect William Strickland (1788-1854). Strickland died before construction was completed and was interred in the walls of the north portico. His son, Francis W. Strickland, oversaw the completion of the project. The cupola was reputedly modeled on a Greek monument to Lysicrates and designed to be illuminated at night like a lantern. The building was constructed of Tennessee Limestone and underwent major restoration from 1956-1960. During the restoration, much of the limestone, including most in the cupola and the Ionic columns and capitals, was replaced with Indiana limestone. The grounds contain monuments to famous people and events in Tennessee history. The Capitol was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.  A handwritten notation below the caption reads: &#8220;Governor&#8217;s Reception, June 14, [19]04.&#8221;  Forms part of Glimpses of Nashville, Tennessee. 1 booklet
