<dc:title>"Which Hand?," 1956 August 13</dc:title>
<dc:description>An original political cartoon drawing created by Jack Knox, the Nashville Banner editorial cartoonist from the mid-1940s to early 1970s.  This cartoon is a caricature of the Democratic presidential balloting and supporters in the national election of 1956, when Eleanor Roosevelt threw her support behind Adlai Stevenson and former President Harry Truman backed New York Governor Averell Harriman.  At the 1956 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Stevenson won the nomination on the first ballot, but ultimately lost the national election when incumbent Eisenhower was re-elected for a second term.  In the cartoon, a confused man ("The South") looks on as a man with a fake donkey head holds two signs behind his back: "Eleanor, Adlai, Estes, &amp; Co." and "Truman, Harriman, &amp; Co."  The populist Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver is referred to in the cartoon--earlier in the year Kefauver had fought a very close primary with Adlai Stevenson.  The editorial cartoon appeared beside the national affairs article "Harry Truman's Stand Enhances Adlai's Chances" by David Lawrence in the August 13, 1956 issue of the Nashville Banner.  Forms part of the Jack Knox Political Cartoon Collection. 1 original cartoon drawing : b &amp; w ; 14.5 x 19.5 in.</dc:description>
