<dc:title>Photograph of the demolition of buildings on the east side of the Public Square in Nashville, Tennessee, circa 1950s</dc:title>
<dc:description>This image shows the destruction the east side of Nashville's public square. The square, with the county courthouse, city hall and market center, was a focus of wholesale commerce and political activity for the city for many years. The old city hall, dating from the 1850s, was replaced by a new city hall and courthouse in 1937. Most of the remaining buildings were destroyed in the 1970s as part of urban renewal projects. The crane has already demolished 332 Public Square East, the site of Everett Beasley, Inc. Part of building at 334 Public Square East, the former site of the Southern Coat and Dress Company and Golden Art Hosiery Company, can be seen to be still standing in the picture. These structures were demolished in 1974 during the construction of the Gay Street connector. Photographed by the Nashville architect Charles Wesley Warterfield, Jr. (1926-1998); the architectural photograph forms part of the Charles Warterfield Architectural Collection. Gift of: The Estate of Charles W. Warterfield, Jr., F. A. I. A.</dc:description>
