<dc:title>Jumbo's naturally a trifle suspicious, between 1941 and 1942</dc:title>
<dc:description>An original political cartoon drawing created by Jack Knox, the Nashville Banner editorial cartoonist from the mid-1940s to the early 1970s.  A cheerful President Roosevelt is depicted walking back from a "Pearl Harbor Visit" shouldering a gun ("That Forthcoming Report").  A concerned elephant ("GOP") looks on, asking "Hey!, That thing ain't loaded for elephant, is it?"  Fala, Roosevelt's terrier, is seen running briskly along in the foreground.  The attack on Pearl Harbor occurred on December 7, 1941, and the Federal government responded by enacting into law declarations of war against Japan, Germany, and Italy.  Congress pledged "all of the resources of the country" to the effort.  President Roosevelt described his budget as a "war budget," making specific requests for funds, which Congress dealt with through the usual annual appropriations process.  Forms part of the Jack Knox Political Cartoon Collection. 1 original cartoon drawing : b &amp; w ; 14 x 17.5 in.</dc:description>
