<dc:title>Photograph of the Nashville Public Library bookmobile, circa 1941</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph showing young people greeting the arrival of the Nashville Public Library bookmobile, circa July, 1941, at Stewart's Cash Grocery in Davidson County, Tennessee. Mrs. Frances Parkes and Mrs. Leah Rose, employees of the Nashville Public Library, traveled with the truck on its service route to rural residents in the outlying communities. The bookmobile project was under the direction of Librarian F. K. W. (Francis Keese Wynkoop) Drury and sponsored by the Works Progress Administration, the Nashville Public Library, the County School Library and the local Rotary Club. The bookmobile service in Davidson County, Tennessee originally began in the 1940's, when the State Library Project furnished a bookmobile which made weekly demonstration rounds through the county. In 1947, the Nashville Public Library initiated the "library-on-wheels" bookmobile service; by 1956, service had been extended to all of Davidson County. Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph : b &amp; w ; 3 x 4.5 in.</dc:description>
