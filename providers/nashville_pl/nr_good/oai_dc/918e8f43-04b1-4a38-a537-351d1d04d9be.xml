<dc:description>An inside cover image from a booklet advertising the services of the Marshall &amp; Bruce printing company.  The image shows the various storefronts that the company occupied over the early years between 1865 and 1906.  In 1905 Marshall and Bruce Company celebrated the completion of its new building at 162-6 Fourth Avenue North.  The building was seventy feet tall and ran back 170 feet to an alley.  It contained 50,000 square feet of floor space and was erected at the cost of $30,000.  On the street level were the offices and store with plenty of space for the stock.  In the rear of the store was the press room where eight cylinder presses were operated.  Some major contracts for the company during this time included the publications of the Baptist Sunday School Board, the Code of Tennessee, the Digest of Alabama Reports, the Digest of Mississippi Reports and the Gray &amp; Dudley Hardware Co. Catalogue, among many others.  After various building changes and equipment advancements, Marshall &amp; Bruce is still an active and efficient printing company in Nashville.
