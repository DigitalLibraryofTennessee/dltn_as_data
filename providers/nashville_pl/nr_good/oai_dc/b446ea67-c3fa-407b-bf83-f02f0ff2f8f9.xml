<dc:title>Salvage scrap drive in Nashville and Middle Tennessee region, 1942 October</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pictured: &#8220;Spain Avenue &#8216;Junior Cadets&#8217; join scrap army: neighborhood friends on Spain Avenue have added patriotic activities to their playtime ones.  This group of boys, now known as the Junior Cadets, are canvassing their neighborhood for scrap instead of playing games, and with excellent results.  One truck load of scrap metal and rubber they collected has already been sent to the junk dealer and this pile is the product of three days&#8217; searching.  The Junior Cadets are (standing, left to right) Lt. Gen. Leighton Braswell, Gen. George Coon, Pvt. Jerry Hudson, Sgt. Richmond Neese, Pvt. Tom Hudson, Pvt. Hilary Cowan, Pvt. Ernest Stillwell, Sgt. Billy Potts, Pvt. Ralph Toon, Sgt. Brazwell Garrison, Corp. Lawson Brazwell, and Pvt. Billy Burnett.  Seated on the pile of scrap are (in front, left to right) Pvt. Eugene Cowan and Pvt. Wayne Potts.  Pvt. Ronald Denton is perched on top of the pile.  During World War II Americans were active with scrap drives to help the war effort.  Local communities were salvaging raw materials such as metal, rags, rubber, and paper to be used to supply troops.  These special home front war programs were often well-coordinated through committees that engaged widespread urban and rural participation and motivated patriotism and community spirit.
