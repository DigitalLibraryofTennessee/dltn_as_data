<dc:description>A historic marker for Johnson&#8217;s Station that reads: &#8220;Johnson&#8217;s Station: A double log house and a few log cabins, partially picketed, stood here about 1790.  On May 9, 1793, 4 children on their way to the spring were attacked by Indians.  Three were scalped and killed.  One escaped.  The home of Charles Bosley, wealthy pioneer and a member of the Nickajack Expedition, later stood on this site.&#8221;  The original land grant was made to Isaac Johnson; he sold the property to Charles Bosley.  This marker, erected in 1969, is located on the West side of Harding Road near Richland Creek near Overbrook School.  Forms part of the Claynita Harris Slide Collection.  The original is a 35 mm color transparency (2 x 2 in. slide mount) </dc:description>
