<dc:title>City officials place first street marker, Nashville, Tennessee, 1941 March 06</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pictured: &#8220;Mayor Thomas L. Cummings and other city officials grouped above, inaugurated a program of city-wide street marking yesterday afternoon by placing the first of the new concrete marking posts at the intersection of Eighteenth Avenue, North, and Clay Street.  It is planned that each intersection will have two markers similar to the one above except in the business section where a different standard will be used.  The post shown above has not yet been lettered but the street name has been filled in by a Banner artist to show how the post will look.  Painting crews will follow close behind the erection crews as the markers are set up.  From left to right, officials in the picture are: Police Inspector Ed Burgess, Councilman H. H. Sadler, in whose ward the post was placed; Dr. J. W. Bauman, F. O. Beazley, city engineer; Councilman Tony St. Charles, Mayor Cummings, E. B. Stahlman, Jr., chairman of the Nashville Traffic Commission; W. H. Mann, assistant traffic engineer; and Tom Springfield a secretary-manager of the Nashville Automobile Club.&#8221;  Source: Banner newspaper, March 7, 1941.
