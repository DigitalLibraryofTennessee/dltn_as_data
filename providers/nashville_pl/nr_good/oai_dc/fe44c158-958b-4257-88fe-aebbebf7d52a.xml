<dc:title>Letter from P.J. Williamson to his wife, Eunice, 1869 November 26</dc:title>
<dc:description>A letter from Dutch immigrant, Peter J. Williamson, to his wife, Eunice, in the years following the Civil War.  In 1862 Williamson enlisted as a Private in the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, Company F and was ultimately promoted to Full 1st Lieutenant.  During the war, Williamson's regiment was involved in scouting and raids in Missouri and Arkansas and saw battle in the Middle Tennessee, Chickamauga, and Atlanta campaigns. After the war, he and his family settled in Nashville and he became an architect.  In this letter from Nashville, Tennessee, Williamson is happy that Eunice is at William's but is distressed to read that her health is not well.  He hopes that her health rebounds and she can continue home soon.  He reports that the house they rent has been sold so they must find another.  He relates that he can get one on Summer Street but intends to wait until she is home to choose.  He discusses their sons including that both are in school and that Johnny has changed a lot since she last saw him.  He tells Eunice of a business trip to Louisville and New Albany, Indiana.  He closes by telling her to come home when she feels well enough to travel and to let him know when she will leave San Francisco.  Forms part of the Peter J. Williamson Letters. 1 letter : col. ; 8 x 10 in.</dc:description>
