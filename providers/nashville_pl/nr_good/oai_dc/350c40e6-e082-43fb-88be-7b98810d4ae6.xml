<dc:title>Nashville to be cleaned up, these claim, from the Nashville Times, 1940</dc:title>
<dc:description>A captioned photo from the Nashville Times (1940), about the Junior Chamber of Commerce. The caption reads: &#8220;Nashville is not going to tolerate unclean streets, alleys, backyards, etc., this summer, if the Junior Chamber of Commerce has anything to do with it. Following in the wake of a mammoth parade intended to awaken Nashville folk to their responsibility in making the city clean, these cleaners took part to show how it is done. Clean-up, Paint-up, shine-up, will be the slogan here the next few weeks.&#8221;  A trolley car can be seen in the background. Forms part of the Nashville Times newspaper collection. 1 digital photo.
