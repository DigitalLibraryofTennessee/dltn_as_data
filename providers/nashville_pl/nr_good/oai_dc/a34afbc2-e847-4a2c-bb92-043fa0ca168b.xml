<dc:title>Nashville Trust Building, Nashville, Tennessee, circa 1925   </dc:title>
<dc:description>Photographs related to the construction of the Nashville Trust Building, circa 1925, by the Foster and Creighton company, in downtown Nashville, Tennessee.  Nashville Trust originally opened as the Central National Bank and was later known as the Nashville City Bank and Trust.  This fourteen-story skyscraper, located at 315 Union Street, was designed by Asmus and Clark, architects.  In 1995, Hastings Architecture Associates renovated the building as the Nashville headquarters of Regions Bank.  In the next decade, developers converted both the adjacent American Trust Building (235 Third Avenue N) and this structure, into a residential center.  Several of the photographs also depict construction of the American Trust Building (with its eleven floor addition designed by Henry C. Hibbs); the two competing banks strived to build the tallest skyscraper.  The Foster &amp; Creighton construction contracting firm was founded in 1885 by Wilbur F. Foster and Robert T. Creighton, who had both served as City Engineer of Nashville.  Forms part of the Foster &amp; Creighton General Contractors Collection. 10 b &amp; w photographs.  </dc:description>
