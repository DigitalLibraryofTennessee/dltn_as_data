<dc:title>Belle Vue historical marker, Nashville, Tennessee, 1981 April </dc:title>
<dc:description>An historical marker about Belle Vue that reads: &#8220;The original log part of this house was built about 1818 by Abram DeMoss and named Belle Vue for the house his father, Lewis DeMoss, built in 1797 overlooking the Harpeth River a mile southwest.  In time the name was given to the Nashville &amp; Northwestern Railroad depot and to the U.S. Post Office.  Thus the Bellevue community owes its name to this historic site.&#8221;  Forms part of the Claynita Harris Slide Collection.  The original is a 35 mm color transparency (2 x 2 in. slide mount) </dc:description>
