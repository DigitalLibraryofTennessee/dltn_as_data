<dc:title>BMG Building, 2002 January</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of the BMG Entertainment building located at 1400 Eighteenth Avenue South, Nashville, Tennessee.  The historic castle-like structure was built in 1916 by the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Catholic order that cared for thousands of elderly, poor Nashvillians before folding in 1968.  After 1968 the building served as a home for a handful of nursing homes until 1998, when BMG moved into the space.  The structure is listed on the National Register of Historic places and is a prime example of Renaissance Revival architecture.  While extensive interior renovations have been made to accommodate an office setting, the exterior of the building has remained virtually unchanged.  This is due to the fact that the building sits in a conservation district, prohibiting any exterior alterations to old buildings. The foundation is red brick with a cap of smooth cut stone blocks.  The exterior walls are tan brick with stone window sills.  The roof is gabled with slate shingles and hipped with dormers.  It also contains tile caps and copper flashing.  The windows are arched and rectangular with clear glass panes.  In the sanctuary there are small circular stained glass windows.  The doors are made of metal and wood.  Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4  x 6  in.</dc:description>
