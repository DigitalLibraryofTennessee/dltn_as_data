<dc:description>This portion of Jefferson Street, close to the campuses of Fisk University and Meharry Medical College, was the center of black life and culture in Nashville at this time. The construction of the interstate destroyed significant portions of this important social and cultural hub, as well as many parts of the nearby neighborhood. The foreground of this photo is the location of a future major interchange of I-40 and I-265, which would obliterate much of this neighborhood. In 2000, Interstate 265 ceased to exist, and was redesignated as part of Interstate 65. </dc:description>
