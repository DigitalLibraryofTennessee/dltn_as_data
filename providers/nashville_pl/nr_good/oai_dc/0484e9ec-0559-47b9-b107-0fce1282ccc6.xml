<dc:title>Photograph of World War I victory garden exhibit booth, between 1914 and 1918</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of Mrs. J.H. Matthews showing off a sampling of her Victory Garden produce and canned goods.  She won fourteen ribbons at the Tennessee State Fair War Exhibition and was very active in the Victory Garden Association, demonstrating to homes the proper way to successfully set up your own garden.  During World War I, Americans were encouraged to grow their own produce in a private garden in order to leave a larger supply of commercially mass produced food available for the troops overseas.  This home front effort resulted not only in a savings for the War Department, but also as an at-home morale booster.  Gardeners could feel empowered by their contribution of labor and rewarded by the produce grown in their civic gardens.  Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph : b &amp; w ; 8 x 10 in.</dc:description>
