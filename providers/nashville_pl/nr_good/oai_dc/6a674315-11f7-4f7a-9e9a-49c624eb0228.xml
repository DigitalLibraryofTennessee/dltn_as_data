<dc:title>Demolition at J.C. Napier Homes Project Site, c.1939</dc:title>
<dc:description>Photograph of demolition at the site of the J.C. Napier Homes (Project Tenn. 5-2, 5-2A) on Claiborne Street. After the Nashville Housing Authority was first approved by the City Council in 1938, they began work on an application to build two low-cost housing projects, namely Boscobel Heights (later named after James A. Cayce) and the J.C. Napier Homes (named for James Carroll Napier). They submitted their application to be approved by the U.S. Housing Authority a year later, and the units were designed by Joseph W. Holman of Marr and Holman architects. Construction of the housing project was completed in the early 1940s. Forms part of the MDHA Photograph Collection. 1 photograph : b &amp; w. </dc:description>
