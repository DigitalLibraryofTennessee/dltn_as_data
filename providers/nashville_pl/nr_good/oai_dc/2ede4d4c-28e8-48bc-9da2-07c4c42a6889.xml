<dc:title>Where two men plunged to death today, from the Nashville Times, 1940</dc:title>
<dc:description>A captioned photo from the Nashville Times (1940), about the death of two men who fell from scaffolding. The caption reads: &#8220;Two men traveled the course of this white line to their death when scaffolding gave way as they chinked cracks in the window sills of Morris Memorial Building, Fourth Avenue North, and Cedar Street.&#8221; It was in 1924 that the architectural firm of McKissack and McKissack received a contract from the National Baptist Convention, to design Morris Memorial Building, located at 330 Charlotte Avenue. The building is named for Reverend E. C. Morris, former president of the National Baptist Convention. It stands in the site formerly occupied by the Commercial Hotel, which housed a slave market before the Civil War. Forms part of the Nashville Times newspaper collection. 1 digital photo.</dc:description>
