<dc:title>Lindsley Avenue Church of Christ, 2001 May</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of the Lindsley Avenue Church of Christ located at 3 Lindsley Avenue in Nashville, Tennessee.  The building permit for this church was obtained by Robert Sharp, a Nashville architect who later worked on Hume-Fogg school.  Originally built in 1894 as South Nashville Cumberland Presbyterian Church, this building's name changed in 1900 to Grace Presbyterian Church.  By 1907 a legal controversy with the Presbyterians, U.S.A., who had gained control of the church, led to a division of the congregation and the sale of the building to the Church of Christ.  The architectural style draws on a mostly Romanesque revival approach with touches of Gothic influences. The foundation is made of stone.  The exterior walls are brick with terra cotta detailing.  The roof is made of composition shingles.  The windows are in the Gothic sash style.  The panel doors are made of wood.  Special features include stained glass windows with metal guards and protective glass on the outside.  Other architectural features include turrets, gables, pinnacles, and a cupola.  This church was nominated for the Metro Historical Commission's Architectural Award in 1978.  Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4  x 6  in.</dc:description>
