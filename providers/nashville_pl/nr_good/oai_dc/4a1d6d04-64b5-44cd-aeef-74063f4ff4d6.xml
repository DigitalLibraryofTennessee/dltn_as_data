<dc:title>Photograph of Goodies buildings, after the 1985 fire, front view showing upper stories.</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of the buildings at 200 and 210 Second Ave. North, after they were gutted by fire on October 12, 1985. This view is from the west, across Second Avenue. The buildings had been connected for some time and had been the site of a variety of businesses, including a furniture store, small retail shops, studios and a restaurant. During the 1970s and early 1980s the structures were commonly known as the Goodies building because of the restaurant and retail business by that name that occupied a large portion of the property. The structures were built 1881-1890 and were part of several blocks of buildings constructed as warehouses, and occasionally providing office and retail space. The fire also gutted the nearby building that housed part of Washington Manufacturing Co. building. This section of Second Ave. was listed on the National Register of Historic Sites in 1972. Eventually, the entire east side of the block, from Church Street north to Bank Street, was razed. Photographed by the Nashville architect Charles Wesley Warterfield, Jr. (1926-1998); the architectural photograph forms part of the Charles Warterfield Architectural Collection. Gift of: The Estate of Charles W. Warterfield, Jr., F. A. I. A. The original is a 35 mm color transparency (2 x 2 in. slide mount)</dc:description>
