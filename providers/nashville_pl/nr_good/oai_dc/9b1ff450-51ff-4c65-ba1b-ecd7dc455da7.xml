<dc:title>Soft drink stand profits go to the Red Cross, from the Nashville Times, 1940</dc:title>
<dc:description>A captioned photo from the Nashville Times (1940), about Nashville children contributing profits from a soft drink stand to provide food to children in Europe, via a Red Cross project. The caption reads: &#8220;There&#8217;ll be little drinking of the profits of this soft drink stand on Byron Avenue this week. Those profits will go to children in Europe who won&#8217;t have soft drinks for a long time to come, but who could use any kind of fodd today. The proprietors are shown in the pictured. Left to right, they are Anne Sexton, George Carpenter, Martha Ann Byrn, James Ballentine, Bill Sexton, Lytle Brown, and Dorothy Ballentine. The Red Cross will get all the profit.&#8221; Forms part of the Nashville Times newspaper collection. 1 digital photo.</dc:description>
