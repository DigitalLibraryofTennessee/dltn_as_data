<dc:description>Pictured: Nashville civic leader, businessman, and banker James Carroll &#8220;J. C.&#8221; Napier.  This renown African American was one of the founders of Citizens Bank, where he served as cashier without pay until his death in 1940.  This successful bank was the first minority owned bank in Tennessee, established in 1904 through the vision of three prominent Nashvillians: R. H. Boyd, Preston Taylor and J. C. Napier.  The 1938 City Directory cites the building address at 345 4th Avenue N with Henry A. Boyd, President; W. J. Hale, Vice-Pres., James C. Napier, Cashier, and A. G. Price, Asst. Cashier.  Napier served as U. S. Registrar of the Treasury in Washington from 1911 to 1914.  Napier passed away at age 94.  He was buried in Nashville&#8217;s Greenwood Cemetery.
