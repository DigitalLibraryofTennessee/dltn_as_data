<dc:title>Edgefield Baptist Church, 2001 January</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of Edgefield Baptist Church located at 700 Russell Street in the historic neighborhood of Edgefield in Nashville, Tennessee.  The congregation was first organized in 1867 with thirty-one members.  Construction on this church began in 1905 and the first service was held inside the sanctuary in 1907.  Adjoining educational facilities were added in 1948.  The building plans were drawn by Wheeler, Runge, and Dickey, and the architectural style is consistently Gothic throughout the exterior and interior.  The church has towers at each corner and a gable bay with a large window at the center of each street facade.  All of the door and window openings have pointed arches.  The foundation of the church is made of stone, while the exterior walls are brick.  The roof is comprised of asphalt shingles, and the windows are stained glass.  A unique feature of the interior is the solid wooden door separating the two auditoriums.  The door can be raised and lowered by means of cables, operated by an electric motor.  The original structure was placed on the National Historic Register in 1977 as part of the Historic Edgefield community.  Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4  x 6  in.</dc:description>
