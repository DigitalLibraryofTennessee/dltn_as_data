<dc:title>The buds have bloomed to flowers, 1859</dc:title>
<dc:description>During the 1800s, educated young women in Nashville often collected sheet music.  When a young lady had collected enough pieces of music, her assortment was generally published as a bound volume by one of Nashville's blank book manufacturers, with the name of the young woman printed on the front cover.  This three page ballad comes from Mary Covington's sheet music book.   It is dedicated to the graduates of the Nashville Female Academy and was published by C.D. Benson &amp; Co. of Nashville.  Forms part of the 19th Century Song Books and Sheet Music Collection. 1 sheet music publication : col. ; 9.5 x 13 in.</dc:description>
