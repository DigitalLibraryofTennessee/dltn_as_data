<dc:title>A. Z. Kelley and the legal team for Kelley v. Board of Education of Nashville, 1955 September</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of A. Z. Kelley and some of the legal team from Kelley v. Board of Education of Nashville in September 1955.  Following the Brown v. Board of Education ruling, the Supreme Court issued Brown II, ordering that schools to desegregate "with all deliberate speed" and assigned supervision of desegregation policies to the federal district courts.  Soon thereafter, on September 23, 1955, attorneys Z. Alexander Looby, Avon Williams, Jr., and Thurgood Marshall filed suit against the Nashville city schools on behalf of 21 African-American children, including 14-year-old Robert W. Kelley, who had been turned away from East Junior High School. His father, A. Z. Kelley, agreed to be the lead plaintiff, so the case was named Kelley v. Board of Education.  Pictured left to right:  Reverend Kelly Miller Smith, Thurgood Marshall, Z. Alexander Looby, and A.Z. Kelley.  Forms part of the Civil Rights Photograph Collection. 1 photograph : b &amp; w ; 8 x 10 in.</dc:description>
