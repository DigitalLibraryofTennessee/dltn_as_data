<dc:title>Exterior view of a parking lot building, previously known as the Hewgley&#8217;s Music Shop, located on Commerce Street, Nashville, Tennessee, 2014 June 14 </dc:title>
<dc:description>A view of a parking garage site that was earlier the original Ernest Tubb Record Shop and later the Hewgley&#8217;s Music Store, located at 720 Commerce Street in downtown Nashville, Tennessee.  It was operated by Ernest Tubb as a record store from 1947-51 before relocating to a store on Lower Broadway.  Circa 1955 until 1998, the building became the home to the Nashville headquarters of Hewgley&#8217;s Music Store, a music shop founded in the late 1940s in Columbia, Tennessee.  In this photo, the Hewgley&#8217;s sign and lettering is pictured on the south side of the brick building. The former music store remained vacant and the garage portion was leased to Central Parking.  In 2003, the federal government acquired the building, as part of plans for a future U.S. Courthouse planned along Church Street between Seventh and Eighth avenues.  Forms part of the Leanne Garland Photograph Collection.  1 digital photograph.</dc:description>
