Camp Forrest was built near Tullahoma, Tennessee as a National Guard Camp in 1926.  During World War II, Camp Forrest was one of the Army&#8217;s largest training bases for infantry, artillery, engineer, and signal organizations.  It also served as a hospital center and temporary encampment area for troops during maneuvers. Large scale war games were conducted in an area around Camp Forrest as America conducted a full dress rehearsal for the coming invasion in Europe.  William Northern Field, an air training base, was an addition for war preparation.  Camp Forrest officially became a prisoner of war camp May 12, 1942.  Initially the camp held civilian detainees who were incarcerated under a program called &#8220;Alien Enemy Control.&#8221;  During the World War II, hundreds of thousands of military soldiers trained in the Tennessee Maneuvers area.
