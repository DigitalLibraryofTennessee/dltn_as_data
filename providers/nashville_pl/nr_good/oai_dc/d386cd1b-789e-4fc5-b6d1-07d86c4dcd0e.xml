<dc:title>Genesco Park Administration Building, Nashville, Tennessee, 2015 February 05 </dc:title>
<dc:description>An exterior view of the Genesco Park Administration Building (1415 Murfreesboro Road, Nashville, Tennessee), pictured from the porch of Monell&#8217;s at the Manor.  This six-story concrete and steel building of 290,000 square feet was built in the mid-1960s as the Genesco World Headquarters.  The structure was designed in the New Formalism style of modern architecture by John Charles Wheeler &amp; Associates.  Genesco was originally founded as the Jarman Shoe Company in 1924 as a footwear manufacturer, they were later renamed the General Shoe Company in the 1930s.  Johnston &amp; Murphy was purchased in 1951 and moved operations to Nashville.  The company took the name &#8220;Genesco&#8221; in 1959 under the leadership of W. Maxey Jarman, the son and co-founder J.F. Jarman, when the company began the process of diversification and expansion of the business.  Genesco repositioned itself as a retailer and exited the footwear manufacturing business when it closed Johnston &amp; Murphy&#8217;s Nashville, TN factory in 2002.  Forms part of the Leanne Garland Photograph Collection.  1 digital photograph.</dc:description>
