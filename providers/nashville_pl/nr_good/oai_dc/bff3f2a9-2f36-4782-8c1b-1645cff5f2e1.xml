<dc:title>Tommy Sands and Nancy Sinatra arrive at Union Station and visit McNeilly Day Home, Nashville, Tennessee, 1961 June 25</dc:title>
<dc:description>This photo relates to Tommy Sands and Nancy Sinatra&#8217;s arrival in Nashville on June 25th, 1961 via train, where they were met at Union Station by admiring fans.  The couple also visited McNeilly Day Home and met with young school-age children.  United Givers Fund awarded the facility with sponsorship and a commemorative plaque.  Before the couple departed via train, Mr. Sands was presented with a key to the City of Nashville. Thomas Adrian "Tommy" Sands, a popular teen idol of circa 1950s - 1960s, became an overnight sensation when he appeared on the Kraft Television Theater in January 1957 as &#8220;The Singin&#8217; Idol,&#8221; and his song &#8220;Teen Age Crush&#8221; reached No. 2 Billboard&#8217;s Hot 100 and No. 1 on Cashbox.  In 1960 he married Nancy Sinatra and for a time they were the toast of Hollywood until their divorce in 1965.  Sands also performed in several films including &#8220;Mardi Gras&#8221; in 1959, &#8220;Babes in Toyland&#8221; in 1961, &#8220;The Longest Day&#8221; in 1962, &#8220;Ensign Pulver&#8221; in 1964, and &#8220;None But the Brave,&#8221; in 1965.  The music genres Sands performed, besides pop music, included Country, Countrypolitan, Pop Music, and Rockabilly.  Sands&#8217; pioneering contribution to the genre of Rockabilly has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame.
