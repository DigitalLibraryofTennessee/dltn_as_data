<dc:title>Letter from P.J. Williamson to his wife, Eunice, during the Civil War, 1864 May 22</dc:title>
<dc:description>A letter from Dutch immigrant, Peter J. Williamson, back home to his wife, Eunice, during the Civil War.  In 1862 Williamson enlisted as a Private in the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, Company F and was ultimately promoted to Full 1st Lieutenant.  During the war, Williamson's regiment was involved in scouting and raids in Missouri and Arkansas and saw battle in the Middle Tennessee, Chickamauga, and Atlanta campaigns. In this letter from Kingston, Georgia, Williamson provides a description of the early part of the Atlanta campaign and his regiment's role.  This includes the Battle of Resaca and a number of different skirmishes along the way to Kingston.  He is in good health despite a couple of narrow misses.  He thanks Eunice for the letter from the 5th of May and discusses the mail a bit further.  He describes the lines as being quiet as the armies reposition themselves but doubts that his unit will be in the coming fight.  He tells her that she can expect to see the casualties list in the Milwaukee Sentinel.  He closes by asking her to remember him in her prayers and speaks of his need to fulfill his duty to her and his country.  Forms part of the Peter J. Williamson Letters. 1 letter : col. ; 8  x 10  in</dc:description>
