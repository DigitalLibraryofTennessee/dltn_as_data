<dc:title>Photograph of Acklen Hall in Acklen Park, Nashville, Tennessee, circa 1960</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of Acklen Hall, home of Joseph Hayes Acklen (1850-1938), on Fairmont Street, Nashville, Tennessee.  Built in the 1890s, this Victorian-style home was the centerpiece of one of Nashville's first gated communities, Acklen Park. Also known as West End Park, the neighborhood was surrounded by a stone wall with gatehouses at the entrances. A portion of the wall remains today along the 3200-3300 blocks of West End Avenue. Acklen Hall was demolished in 1961. In more recent years, the name Acklen Hall was also applied to the Belmont Mansion, another structure that is part of Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee. Photographed by the Nashville architect Charles Wesley Warterfield, Jr. (1926-1998); the architectural photograph forms part of the Charles Warterfield Architectural Collection. Gift of: The Estate of Charles W. Warterfield, Jr., F. A. I. A. The original is a 35 mm color transparency (2 x 2 in. slide mount)</dc:description>
