<dc:title>Immanuel Baptist Church, 2001 February 28</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of Bill Hudson and Associates, an advertising agency that stands on the lot of the former Immanuel Baptist Church located at 1701 West End Avenue in Nashville, Tennessee.  Construction on Immanuel Baptist Church was started in 1911 and finished in 1913, after acquiring the land in 1882.  In 1956 the building was purchased for approximately $100,000 by a Nashville group who demolished the auditorium section and converted the Sunday school unit into a four-story office building.  The Immanuel Baptist congregation moved to a new church on Belle Meade Boulevard before the sale in December of 1954, and they are still there today.  Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4  x 6  in.</dc:description>
