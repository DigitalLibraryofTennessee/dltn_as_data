<dc:title>D. Loveman &amp; Company advertisement, featured in the Yearbook &#8220;Salmagundi,&#8221; of the Boscobel College for Young Ladies, Nashville, Tennessee, 1907  </dc:title>
<dc:description>The D. Loveman &amp; Company advertisement that was featured in the Boscobel College for Young Ladies yearbook of 1907.  This business was one of the oldest department and ready-to-wear stores in Nashville, located at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Union Street in the downtown district.  Later, in 1914, they underwent a change of firm name, becoming D. Loveman, Berger &amp; Teitelbaum, continuing to operate at the same location as when the first original store opened in 1862.  The Boscobel College for Young Ladies was a college in East Nashville, founded in 1889 as the Nashville Baptist Female College by the Tennessee Baptist Convention.  The college operated for twenty-five years--until 1914.  The campus was built around an East Nashville mansion, formerly owned by Anna Shelby Williams.  The mansion stood atop a tree-covered hill overlooking the Cumberland River.  The campus covered ten wooded acres on Sevier Street near South Seventh Street (then called Foster Street), south of Sylvan Street.  In 1918, the property became home to the National Baptist Seminary and Missionary Training School, which functioned until 1931. The buildings were razed in 1940.  Forms part of the yearbook collection: Boscobel College, &#8220;Salmagundi,&#8221; 1907.  1 volume </dc:description>
