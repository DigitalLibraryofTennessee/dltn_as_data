<dc:title>Trinity Presbyterian Church, 2001 November</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of Trinity Presbyterian Church located at 3201 Hillsboro Road in Nashville, Tennessee.  The congregation was founded in 1942 and originally held services in Wightman Chapel on the Scarritt College campus before moving to their present location in 1946.  That first new building now serves as the church's fellowship hall and in 1958 a new sanctuary was completed on the property.  The exterior walls are brick.  The roof is gabled with tar shingles.  The windows are a combination of colored glass and clear glass.  The doors are mostly wood. Special features include a large tower with a steeple.  Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4  x 6  in.</dc:description>
