<dc:title>Salvage scrap drive in Nashville and Middle Tennessee region, 1942 October</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pictured: &#8220;Jackson County brings in the scrap: this is an inspiring picture of what a patriotic county, in addition to sending its sons into battle, can do toward winning the war.  This scene is in Gainesboro, Jackson County.  Piled high against the Courthouse, sturdy symbol of freedom and justice, erected by free people, is a small mountain of scrap.  Ranged behind it (with some boys on top of it) are the citizens of the city and county.  They had a scrap rally Saturday and turned over their salvage to the Future Farmers who are entering the Banner campaign.  Flags flew from the Courthouse, from the business houses and all the residences.  There were patriotic speeches.  It was a day that set an example for all the other 40 counties entered in the campaign.  It set an example for patriotic Americans everywhere.&#8221;  During World War II Americans were active with scrap drives to help the war effort.  Local communities were salvaging raw materials such as metal, rags, rubber, and paper to be used to supply troops.  These special home front war programs were often well-coordinated through committees that engaged widespread urban and rural participation and motivated patriotism and community spirit.
