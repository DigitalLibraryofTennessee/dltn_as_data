<dc:description>A postcard of the Main Building at the George Peabody College for Teachers in Nashville, Tennessee.  In an effort to create a major Southern teachers' college, the grounds and buildings of the former Peabody Normal School were donated to the George Peabody College for Teachers in 1909.  After 1911, Peabody College was geographically re-located to its present location directly across the street from the campus of Vanderbilt University and re-opened in 1914. It later became affiliated with Vanderbilt University, and is now known as the Peabody College of Education and Human Development at Vanderbilt University.  Forms part of the Nashville Room Postcard Collection. 1 postcard : col. ; 3.5  x 5.5  in.</dc:description>
