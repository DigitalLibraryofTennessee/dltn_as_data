<dc:title>Excerpt from public meeting about Vanderbilt student protest, April 5, 1968</dc:title>
<dc:description>An excerpt from a public meeting with former Nashville Mayor Beverly Briley conducted on April 5, 1968.  Meeting held to discuss Vanderbilt student protest that took place on April 4.  The main issue discussed was the calling of the National Guard.  Mayor Briley felt that the Guard's presence might have increased tensions, but that it was justified in terms of what would happen if they were removed.  Other issues mentioned were adult education programs and the possibility of legislation for equal housing and employment opportunity.  The complete record of the meeting is available at the Metro Government Archives.</dc:description>
