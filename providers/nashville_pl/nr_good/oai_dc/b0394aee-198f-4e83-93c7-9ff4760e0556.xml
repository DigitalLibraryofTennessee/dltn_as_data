<dc:title>Setliff, Wholesale Bookseller &amp; Stationer, between 1873 and 1881</dc:title>
<dc:description>A bookplate advertising Setliff &amp; Company, a wholesale bookseller on Church Street.  According to Nashville city directories, the Setliff business was started in 1867 by Abraham Setliff in the Commercial Hotel building located at 33 Cedar Street (now Charlotte Avenue).  By 1873 the business had moved to 108 Church Street.  In 1882 it moved just up the street to 212 Church Street.  An advertisement in the 1887 city directory reads, "Setliff &amp; Company, Dealers in Artists' materials, Optical Instruments, Architects', Engineers', and Surveyors' Goods, Books, Stationary &amp; School Supplies."  In 1888 the business relocated once again to 511 Church Street where it stayed until being turned over to Albert V. and William H. Goodpasture in 1903.  This deal resulted in an obvious name change to Goodpasture Book Company.</dc:description>
