<dc:title>Nashville Union Station train shed, Nashville, Tennessee, circa 1936</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of the train shed at Nashville's Union Station at Broadway and 10th Avenue just to the west of the downtown area, circa 1936. Union Station is a former railroad terminal opened in 1900 to serve the passenger operations of the eight railroads then providing passenger service. The station was designed by Louisville and Nashville (L&amp;N) company engineer Richard Montford. Spanning a length of 200 feet, the train shed was the longest such construction built by the railroad company in the 1890s during their improvement phase. It was designed with a gable roof style and a metal-framed construction, covering the tracks and platforms. The heart pine timber comprised the top of each truss. The Nashville Union Station and Trainshed were placed on the National Register of Historic Places circa 1975. The train shed was razed circa late 2000 after a fire damaged it; the architectural design of the non-extant shed has been carefully recorded. Union Station, with its late-Victorian Romanesque Revival architectural style using Bowling Green gray stone and Tennessee marble, has been restored as a hotel and restaurant and is once again a prominent Nashville architectural and historical landmark. It was re-dedicated on October 9, 2007 after a multi-million dollar renovation. Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph : b &amp; w ; 2.5 x 4.25 in.</dc:description>
