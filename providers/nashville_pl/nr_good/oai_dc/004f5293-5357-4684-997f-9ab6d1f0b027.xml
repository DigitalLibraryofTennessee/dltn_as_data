<dc:title>Jubilee Hall, Fisk University, Nashville, Tenn., between 1915 and 1930</dc:title>
<dc:description>A postcard of Jubilee Hall at Fisk University.  Completed in 1876, this was the first permanent building erected for the higher education of African Americans in the United States.  The six story structure was designed by architect Steven D. Hatch of New York and built in the Victorian Gothic style.  Architectural details include a towering steeple, columns and a portico.  Money for the building was raised by the Fisk Jubilee Singers, for whom the building is named.  In 1971 the structure was added to the National Register of Historic Places, and in 1974 it was designated as a National Historic Landmark.  Today Jubilee Hall is used as a University residence hall.  Forms part of the Norton Postcard Collection. 1 postcard : col. ; 3.5  x 5.5  in.</dc:description>
