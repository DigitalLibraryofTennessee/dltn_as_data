<dc:title>Arlington United Methodist Church, 2000 October</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of Arlington United Methodist Church located at 1360 Murfreesboro Road in Nashville, Tennessee.  The church was started as a Sunday school for neighborhood children in 1873.  Later that year children and adults began meeting for services in a school building.  At the end of the year the congregation hired Ben Turbeville, who had built the Maxwell House Hotel, to construct Arlington Chapel.  The cost was $2,280.  The church was completed in 1874.  Several additions have been made to the original church, including the present sanctuary dedicated April 7, 1957.  The exterior walls are red brick.  The roof is made of grey shingles.  There are three plain glass windows on each side of the church.  There are two single wooden doors.  Special features include decorative lattice work and a central window/vent on the roof.  Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : b &amp; w ; 4  x 6  in.</dc:description>
