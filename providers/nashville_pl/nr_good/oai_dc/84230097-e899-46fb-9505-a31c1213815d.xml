<dc:title>Vultee Aircraft staff working on government planes, Nashville, Tennessee, circa 1941</dc:title>
<dc:description>Pictured: An interior view of the Vultee Aircraft plant where government planes were made in Nashville, Tennessee, circa 1941.  The formal dedication of the plant took place on May 4th, 1941 during the administration of Tennessee Governor Prentice Cooper.  The company was located adjacent to Nashville&#8217;s old Berry Field.  During World War II, large defense contracts of the federal government were with the plant to produce the Vultee Vengeance bombers, and the Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighters.  Many women were employed at the plant, as &#8220;Rosie the riverter&#8221; became a popular symbol of women&#8217;s patriotism. Berry Field became the military base for the 4th Ferrying Command during World War II and was returned to the city when the war ended.  The airport&#8217;s name was officially changed to Nashville International Airport in 1988.  Forms part of Record Group 412, Photographs Collection. 1 photograph negative : b &amp; w ; 4 x 5 in.</dc:description>
