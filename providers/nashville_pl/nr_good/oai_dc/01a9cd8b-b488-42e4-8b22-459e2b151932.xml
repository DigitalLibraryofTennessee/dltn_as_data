<dc:title>Capitol Airways hangar at Berry Field, Nashville, Tennessee, circa 1950</dc:title>
<dc:description>An aviation hangar of Capitol Airways, Inc., at Berry Field airport in Nashville, Tennessee, circa 1950.  The sign also refers to Beechcraft sales and service.  Capitol Airways was founded in 1946 and ended operations in 1982; they were also known as Capitol International Airways.  Named in honor of Colonel Harry S. Berry, state administrator of the WPA, Berry Field consisted of a terminal building, two hangars, a 4,000-foot concrete runway and a flashing beacon. The three letter identifier, BNA, stands for Berry Field Nashville. American and Eastern airlines were the first air carriers to serve Nashville, and within the year, 189,000 passengers had used the facilities.  During World War II, Berry Field became the military base for the 4th Ferrying Command, and the federal government added additional acreage for its military operations. In 1946, after the war ended, the military returned a 1,500-acre airport site to the city.
