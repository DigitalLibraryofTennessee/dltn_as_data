<dc:title>Photograph of the sculpture of  the east pediment and metopes of the Parthenon, Nashville, Tennessee, circa 1970s</dc:title>
<dc:description>A photograph of the sculpture of the east pediment and metopes of the Parthenon in Nashville, Tennessee. The pediment sculpture shows an artists conception of the birth of Athena, who was depicted in Greek myth as having sprung, full grown and in armor, from the head of Zeus. The metopes below contain scenes form the mythical war between the Gods and Centaurs. The full scale replica of the Parthenon in Athens, Greece was originally constructed out of wood, plaster and brick as a temporary exhibit for the Tennessee Centennial Exposition in 1897. The exposition grounds became a city park (Centennial Park) in 1902 and a permanent version of Parthenon was constructed out of concrete in 1921-1931 to replace the one built for the exposition. The sculptures were based on ancient descriptions of the original Parthenon in Greece, and drawings made by Jacques Carrey in 1674. The center portion of the pediment sculpture on the Greek structure was destroyed prior to Carrey making his drawings, so artists have had to interpret the scene from the written description. For this reason, the sculpture varies from that shown in the plans used for the restoration of the Greek structure. The Nashville Parthenon underwent major renovations in 1991-2001. It serves as a museum and art gallery and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.  Photographed by the Nashville architect Charles Wesley Warterfield, Jr. (1926-1998); the architectural photograph forms part of the Charles Warterfield Architectural Collection. Gift of: The Estate of Charles W. Warterfield, Jr., F. A. I. A.  The original is a 35 mm color transparency (2 x 2 in. slide mount)</dc:description>
