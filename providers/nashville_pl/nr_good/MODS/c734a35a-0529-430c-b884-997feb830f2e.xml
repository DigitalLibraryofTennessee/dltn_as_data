  <abstract>A 1922 issue of “The Megaphone,” a student publication of Central High School, Nashville, Tennessee. This publication of Vol. V, is dedicated “To the New Central High School. The yearbook includes faculty and student rosters, writings by students of the high school, and student organizations, as well as local advertisements. Two inserts are included: 1) a program flyer of the Concert by the Music Department of Central High School, May 14th, 1923; and, 2) a program flyer related to a presentation of “The Pot of Broth.” Central High School was founded in 1917 as the first public high school in the county system. One of the earliest student government associations in the South began here. Many graduates became city and county political leaders, such as Nashville City Government Mayor Ben West and the first Metro Government Mayor, Beverly Briley. The last graduating class was 1971 after which the school, located in south Nashville on the hill above the State Fairgrounds on Raines Avenue between Wedgewood Avenue, and Southgate Avenue, was torn down and converted to a Public Television Station.
