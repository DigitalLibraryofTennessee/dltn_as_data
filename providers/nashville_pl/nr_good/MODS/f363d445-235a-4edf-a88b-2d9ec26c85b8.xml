  <abstract>A photograph of Word of Faith Christian Center located at 2635 Nolensville Pike in Nashville, Tennessee. Formerly Grandview Baptist Church, the address was originally listed in the city directory as 2641 Nolensville Road. Grandview Baptist was organized on December 27, 1908 by nine members of the Mill Creek Baptist Church. After their first building burned in 1927, a new building was constructed in 1930. The present auditorium was added in 1947 and a new educational building was added in 1964. The foundation of the church is made of rough cut stone blocks. The exterior walls are red brick. The roof is gabled and flat at the rear with tar shingles. The windows are a combination of clear glass and stained glass. The stained glass windows are arched. Special features include a pediment over the entryway and stone steps. Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4 x 6 in.</abstract>
