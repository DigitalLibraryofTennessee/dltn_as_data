  <abstract>Pictured: Mayor Ben West and Mrs. West (looking up at the camera) in a reception line for the gala event welcoming Hollywood celebrities at the Tennessee Theater in downtown Nashville circa 1952. The Tennessee Theater opened circa February 28, 1952 in Nashville, Tennessee. This palatial Art Deco movie palace was located in downtown Nashville at 527 Church Street. It featured a 2,000-seat auditorium adjoining the Sudekum Building. The gala opening featured a Technicolor musical called “About Face” and many onlookers watched the arrival and announcement of movie stars such as Gordon MacRae, Phyllis Kirk, Lex Barker, and others. Many local VIPS attended the gala ceremony and Owen Bradley and his orchestra played inside on stage that night. Some of the outside activities included broadcasts by WSIX radio and WSM television, a concert by the American Legion Post 5 band, and the arrival of the honored celebrities. Forms part of Record Group 3, Metro Davidson County Photographer. 1 photograph negative : b &amp; w ; 4 x 5 in.</abstract>
