  <abstract>A photograph of Newsom's Mill, along the Harpeth River, near Bellevue, located a few miles southwest of downtown Nashville, Tennessee. The original grist mill was built several years earlier; this grist mill was built by Col. Joseph M. Newsom in 1862. For many years its milling operation was central to the agrarian economy of the area. The stone frame of the mill is still intact today, along with the iron shaft and wheel of the turbine-powered mechanism. The mill was originally located close to a railroad station (Newsom's Station) and a post office and store were built nearby. In 1974, the mill and some of the surrounding acreage was purchased by the state as part of the development plan for the state Scenic Rivers Act. The Tennessee Historical Marker describes this historic site: "The original Newsom's Mill was located upstream &amp; was destroyed by flood in 1808. Joseph M. Newsom constructed this turbine-powered gristmill in 1862 of hand-dressed limestone from Newsom's quarry, a mile south. Newsom's stone is found in many important buildings in the city of Nashville." Photographed by the Nashville architect Charles Wesley Warterfield, Jr. (1926-1998); the architectural photograph forms part of the Charles Warterfield Architectural Collection. Gift of: The Estate of Charles W. Warterfield, Jr., F. A. I. A. The original is a 35 mm color transparency (2 x 2 in. slide mount).</abstract>
