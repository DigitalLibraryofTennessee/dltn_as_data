  <abstract>A photograph of Mary Florence Kirkman Drouillard, between 1890 and 1905. She was born in Nashville on August 23, 1843, the daughter of Hugh Kirkman and Eleanora C. Van Leer. She was educated in local private schools and completed her education in New York City. She was the wife of Union Caption James Pierre Drouillard, an 1861 graduate of West Point. After the Civil War, the Drouillards moved to Dickson County to reopen the Cumberland Furnace that she had inherited from her grandfather, Anthony Wayne Van Leer. In 1870 the Drouillards built an Italianate-style residence similar to mansions in Newport. Also in 1870, Drouillard bought her brother's share of the furnace. She built St. James Episcopal church and a parish school. In 1886, they returned to Nashville, dividing their time between the city and Europe. They resided at a large red brick mansion located at the corner of Vauxhall (Ninth Avenue) and Demonbreun Streets. Mrs. Drouillard died May 19, 1905, and is buried with her husband in the family plot in Mt. Olivet Cemetery, Nashville. Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph : sepia ; 4 x 5.25 in.</abstract>
