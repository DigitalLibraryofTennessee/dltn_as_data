  <abstract>Pictured: Jean Faircloth MacArthur holding a fishing rod, seated next to son Arthur on the platform among military officials and townspeople, at Middle Tennessee State College on the occasion of an honorary ceremony in 1951. Both General MacArthur and his wife spoke at the outdoor football stadium event. And the city of Murfreesboro welcomed the couple with a parade and celebration in honor of the couplesâ€™ 14th wedding anniversary. Jean was a great-granddaughter of a former Mayor and she had lived for 34 years in a pillared mansion on East Lytle Street. The head of the Murfreesboro household was her grandfather, Capt. Richard Beard, a Confederate veteran. General Douglas MacArthur was an American general and field marshal of the Philippine Army who was Chief of Staff of the United States Army during the 1930s and played a prominent role in the Pacific theater during World War II.
