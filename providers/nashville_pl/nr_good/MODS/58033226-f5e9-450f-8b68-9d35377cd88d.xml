  <abstract>A scene related to the Nashville Symphony Orchestra concert at War Memorial Auditorium, circa December 1948. The orchestra was conducted by William Strickland. The Nashville Symphony's beginnings can be traced to 1945, when World War II veteran and Nashville native Walter Sharp returned home intent on establishing a new symphony orchestra for Middle Tennessee. With the assistance of a small number of fellow music lovers, he convinced community leaders of this need and the Nashville Symphony was founded. Sharp retained William Strickland, a young conductor from New York, to serve as the first music director and conductor. The orchestra performed its first concert in the fall of 1946 at War Memorial Auditorium in downtown Nashville. Over the next five seasons, Strickland was responsible for setting the high performance standards that the orchestra and its conductors have maintained to this day. Forms part of Record Group 3, Metro Davidson County Photographer. 1 photograph negative : b &amp; w ; 4 x 5 in.</abstract>
