  <abstract>The 1911 yearbook, known as “Salmagundi,” published by Boscobel College for Young Ladies, featuring students, faculty, trustees, clubs, athletics, societies, and more. Boscobel College for Young Ladies was a college in East Nashville, founded in 1889 as the Nashville Baptist Female College by the Tennessee Baptist Convention. The college operated for twenty-five years--until 1914. The campus was built around an East Nashville mansion, formerly owned by Anna Shelby Williams. The mansion stood atop a tree-covered hill overlooking the Cumberland River. The campus covered ten wooded acres on Sevier Street near South Seventh Street (then called Foster Street), south of Sylvan Street. In 1918, the property became home to the National Baptist Seminary and Missionary Training School, which functioned until 1931. The buildings were razed in 1940.
