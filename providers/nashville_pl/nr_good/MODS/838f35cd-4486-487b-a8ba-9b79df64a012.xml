  <abstract>An exterior view of the Warner Elementary School on Russell Street in East Nashville, first built in 1892 to replace the Main Street School, which had become overcrowded. It was named for James C. Warner, a member of the Percy Warner family who had been a member of the Edgefield Board of Education before the area was annexed to Nashville in 1880. The original building which housed grades 1-8 was destroyed by the great fire of March 1916 which consumed more than 700 buildings in East Nashville. Afterwards, this public school was rebuilt and opened in 1918, yet the building was partially destroyed by another fire that occurred in 1941. In 1949 additional classrooms were added to accommodate the growing population. Forms part of Glimpses of Nashville. 1 booklet</abstract>
