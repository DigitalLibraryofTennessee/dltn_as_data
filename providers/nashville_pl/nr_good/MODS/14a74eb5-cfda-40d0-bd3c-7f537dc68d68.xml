  <abstract>Picture: Nashville baseball players at Sulphur Dell stadium for a day of events honoring entertainer Phil Harris in Nashville, Tennessee. Harris was presented a “Phil Harris Day” proclamation by Mayor Ben West on July 27th, 1951, and there was lots of entertainment including baseball and clowns, with an evening show that featured singer Phil Harris and the band performing music that was broadcast live via WSM radio. Phil Harris (birth name: Wonga Philip Harris) was born in Indiana and grew up in Nashville, Tennessee. He led a distinguished career as a bandleader, singer, musician, actor, and comedian. Harris became a very well-known voice actor for animated films, such as Disney’s “The Jungle Book” and “Robin Hood” and “The AristoCats.” Harris has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
