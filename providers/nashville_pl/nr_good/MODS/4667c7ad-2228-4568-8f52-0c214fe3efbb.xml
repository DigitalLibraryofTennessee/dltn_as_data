  <abstract>“Nashville’s public school officials have planned a program based on democracy and defense. Not only are young people taught the fundamentals of their form of government, but they are taught the necessary principles of preserving it … with airplane motors as his eventual problem, Jack Hurst, 19, is working at present on automobile motors in his eleventh grade studies at Hume-Fogg, but hopes to become an airplane mechanic some day. He is typical of the many young men over the city who are learning their trades through the public schools.” Source: Nashville Banner, April 18th, 1941. Forms part of Record Group 412, Photographs Collection. 1 photograph negative : b &amp; w ; 4 x 5 in.</abstract>
