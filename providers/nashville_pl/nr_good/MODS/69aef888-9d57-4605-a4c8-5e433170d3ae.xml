  <abstract>A photograph of the Community Baptist Church. The church was located in the Waverly neighborhood at 817 S. Douglas Avenue, in Nashville, Tennessee. Other names for the building over the years included Glen Leven Presbyterian Church, and Jesus is the Way Church. The church's architect was Hugh Cathcart Thompson, the designer of the Ryman Auditorium. The foundation of the church was made of rough cut stone blocks. The exterior walls were made of bricks that had been painted grey. The roof was gabled with tar shingles. The windows were gothic arched with stained glass panes. Windows in the rear incorporated clear glass. The doors were wooden with glass windows. Special features included a tower. In 2004 the congregation sold its building to a local developer who planned to keep the church and incorporate its design into the creation of four condominiums. Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4 x 6 in.</abstract>
