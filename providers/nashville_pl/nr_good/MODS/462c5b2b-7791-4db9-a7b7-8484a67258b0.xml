  <abstract>Schoolchildren participating in May Day events at Eakin Elementary School on May 9th, 1941. Eakin Elementary School, located at 2400 Fairfax Avenue in Nashville, Tennessee, was completed as a new two-story structure in 1936. Its student body, grades 1-6 was moved from Cavert School which is adjacent to the Eakin School campus. The new school was named in honor of Mrs. John Hill Eakin, the first woman member of the Nashville City School Board of Education and the founder of the Centennial Club. Initially there were 650 students and 13 teachers. Closely associated with Eakinâ€™s growth and development into a top elementary school were two of its early principals: Miss Maria Cage and Mrs. C. H. Trimble. Forms part of Record Group 412, Photographs Collection. 1 photograph negative : b &amp; w ; 4 x 5 in.</abstract>
