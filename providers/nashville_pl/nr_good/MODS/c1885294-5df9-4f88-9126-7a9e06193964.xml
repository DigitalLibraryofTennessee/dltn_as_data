  <abstract>The Nashville Bridge Company, in February 1953, located along the east side of the Cumberland River in Nashville, Tennessee. The Nashville Bridge Company was organized in 1902 by Mr. A. J. Dyer. Through the years, the Company experienced a continuous and expanding development, with main operations of fabricating and erecting structural steel for buildings, bridges and towers. The Marine Department of the Nashville Bridge Company built barges and towboats. As early as WWI, they filled contracts for the United States Navy, building ships and barges. During World War II, there was increased production of combat vessels and barges for the Army and Navy. Vultee and Nashville Bridge Company accounted for 72% of the city’s war supply contracts.
