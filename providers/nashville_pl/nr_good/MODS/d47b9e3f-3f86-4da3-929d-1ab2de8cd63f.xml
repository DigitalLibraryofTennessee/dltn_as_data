  <abstract>A scene from the May 17th, 1957 baseball game between Nashville Vols and the All-Star team, played at Sulphur Dell ballpark located in Nashville, Tennessee. Sulphur Dell was the home of the Nashville Vols in the Southern Association from 1901 until 1961 and in the South Atlantic League in 1963. According to the Sulphur Dell historical marker: “Nashville’s first (1885) professional baseball was played in the Athletic Park which formerly occupied this block. Traditionally baseball was introduced in Nashville in 1862 by soldiers of the Union army of occupation who played the game here. This low-lying area, originally called Sulphur Spring Bottom, was first called “Sulphur Dell” by local sports writer, Grantland Rice. In 1963 this was the oldest playing grounds still in use in professional baseball.” The historical marker is on Fourth Avenue near where the centerfield fence once stood. Forms part of Record Group 412, Photographs Collection. 1 photograph negative : b &amp; w ; 4 x 5 in.</abstract>
