  <abstract>Exterior views of the Bennie Dillon building located on the corner of Church Street and 7th Avenue N in downtown Nashville, Tennessee. This high-rise building was built by the construction firm Foster &amp; Creighton circa 1925-1927 for George Bennie, a businessman who served as the President of the Nashville Chamber of Commerce, and William Dillon, a real estate developer. It was designed in the Renaissance Revival architectural style by the architectural team Asmus &amp; Clark. The structure features elaborate terra cotta decoration, topped by an expressive Goth arch theme on its roofline. The Bennie Dillon is an adaptive reuse of a twelve-story office building into mixed-use development. It was renovated in the late 1990s when the building was converted to apartments in 1998-1999; the structure was renovated again in 2005. The Bennie-Dillon Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Forms part of the Leanne Garland Photograph Collection. 5 digital photog</abstract>
