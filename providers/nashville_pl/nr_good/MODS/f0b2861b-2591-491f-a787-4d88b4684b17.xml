  <abstract>An aerial view of the Lockheed “Hudson” bombers at the Nashville Municipal Airport, April 29th, 1941. A published article from the “Nashville Banner” newspaper the following day: “Bombers for Britain concentrated at Airport: With twenty-three Lockheed Hudson medium bombers, camouflaged and bearing British insignia, lined up at Municipal Airport today, the field attained increasing importance as a place of temporary storage of bombers manufactured for use by Britain. This is the largest number of planes “bound for Britain” to be concentrated here since the Lockheed factory in California began flying bombers to New York and Canada for shipment to Britain. There was speculation that the number brought here might grow much larger when it was reported the reason for the concentration is that Floyd Bennett Field in New York already is full of planes awaiting shipment. The factory, near Glendale, Calif., is turning them out at the rate of five a day, it was reported. The airport has the capacity to store 100 such bombers without impairing its efficiency. Thirteen of the bombers arrived Friday, and yesterday the second group of ten was flown here from the factory. Twenty of the planes, valued at more than $2,000,000, are shown at the airport. There huge size may be judged by a comparison with the automobile (arrow) near them on the field. Elaborate precautions, including floodlights and numerous guards, are being taken to protect the planes, which, being all-steel and as yet without their guns, may be stored without cover with no damage from the weather.” Forms part of Record Group 412, Photographs Collection. 1 photograph negative : b &amp; w ; 4 x 5 in.</abstract>
