  <abstract>A photograph of student nurses at Nashville's General Hospital attending babies in the nursery. Student nurses were responsible for many duties including caring for newborns, surgical nursing, and working in the diet kitchen and sometimes even mopping the floors. They often worked 12 hours a day plus classes. Nashville General Hospital Nursing School, established in 1892 (two years after the opening of City General Hospital) was one of the first to be accredited in the South. It began with a 26 month course that was extended to 36 in 1912. During the school's existence 1,032 nurses graduated. The school closed in 1970. Forms part of the Nashville Banner Archives. 1 photograph : b &amp; w ; 8 x 10 in.</abstract>
