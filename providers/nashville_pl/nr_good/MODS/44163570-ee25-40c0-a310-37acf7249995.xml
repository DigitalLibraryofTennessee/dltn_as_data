  <abstract>Pictured: “Treasured relics go into scrap heap: the rapidly growing salvage collection in Giles County now includes treasured relics of the War Between the States. In a ceremony held at the monument of Sam Davis on the Public Square at Pulaski, Mrs. George Adams Nelson (left), president of the Pulaski Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, presented cannon balls and other metal relics owned by the chapter to Judge Robert E. Lee, Giles County Salvage Chairman. On the right is Mrs. Mae Abernathy Birdsong, Tennessee Division Registrar of the UDC, a member of the presentation committee. Judge Lee, in replying to the presentation speech of Mrs. Nelson, said: ‘On behalf of the Giles County Salvage Committee, I accept these relics of that unhappy struggle between the North and the South. These sections of our great country have long since been reunited and again we find the sons and daughters of the heroes of the War Between the States fighting side by side to preserve our way of life. These relics, long kept by the daughters of our Confederate fathers, will find their way into that mountain of scrap metal now being gathered by every patriotic American to be used in molding the tools of war to the end that victory may be achieved and peace again restored to the peoples of the earth.’” During World War II Americans were active with scrap drives to help the war effort. Local communities were salvaging raw materials such as metal, rags, rubber, and paper to be used to supply troops. These special home front war programs were often well-coordinated through committees that engaged widespread urban and rural participation and motivated patriotism and community spirit.
