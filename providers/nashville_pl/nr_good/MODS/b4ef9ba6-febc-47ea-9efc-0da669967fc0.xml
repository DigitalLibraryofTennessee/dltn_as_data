  <abstract>The construction site, including an aerial view, of the Nashville Municipal Auditorium, circa February 18th, 1961. This facility, located on Fourth Avenue N in downtown Nashville, opened on October 7th, 1962 and was the first public assembly facility in the Mid-South with air-conditioning. In addition to being a music venue, it has hosted religious conferences and sporting events. The aerial view shows the construction site from above, as well as two Greek Revival style buildings designed by William Strickland: St. Maryâ€™s Catholic Church (Fifth Avenue N, right foreground) and the Tennessee State Capitol Building (bordered by Sixth Avenue and Charlotte). Several government office facilities are seen, along with several buildings that are non-extant. Forms part of Record Group 3, Metro Davidson County Photographer. 3 photograph negatives : b &amp; w ; 4 x 5 in.</abstract>
