  <abstract>An aerial view of the Radnor Lake area, January 3, 1961. Radnor Lake is a 1,200-acre natural area located in Davidson County in the Overton Hills approximately eight miles south of downtown Nashville. This natural area is an outlier of the Western Highland Rim and has some of the highest ridges in the Central Basin. Radnor Lake was protected largely because of public interest that resulted in a campaign to save it from development. This resulted in the State acquiring and then designating it as a state natural area in 1974. The Louisville and Nashville (L&amp;N) Railroad Company had owned the property and impounded Otter Creek in 1914 to create the 85-acre lake. The reservoir was constructed to provide water for steam engines at Radnor Yard some three miles away via gravity through a downhill flowing pipe. The lake that was created and the surrounding forest provided excellent habitat for waterfowl and other birds and animals. Albert Ganier, who was founder of the Tennessee Ornithological Society, was instrumental in persuading the L&amp;N to declare Radnor Lake a wildlife sanctuary in 1923. Forms part of Record Group 412, Photographs Collection. 1 photograph negative : b &amp; w ; 4 x 5 in.</abstract>
