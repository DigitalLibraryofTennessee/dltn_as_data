  <abstract>A photograph of the 1st Tennessee Volunteers in front of tent at Camp Merritt, San Francisco, California, in 1898. The First Tennessee Regiment was mustered into federal service in Nashville circa May, 1898. Selected by the War Department for service in the Philippines during the Spanish-American War, the regiment went to San Francisco where the men first trained at Camp Merritt for four months. They were sent late in 1898 as reinforcements to hold the Philippine Islands that the United States had newly acquired from Spain. The First Tennessee participated in the fighting that erupted in Manila in February 1899. The regiment took an important part in the capture of Iloilo, the second largest city in the Philippines. The First Tennessee Infantry was mustered out of service in San Francisco on November 22, 1901 as one of the most honored of the Spanish-American War state volunteer regiments. The verso of the photograph is stamped: "Sutro Heights Gallery, W. C. Billington, Photographer, San Francisco, Cal." Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 mounted photograph : sepia ; 7 x 10 in.</abstract>
