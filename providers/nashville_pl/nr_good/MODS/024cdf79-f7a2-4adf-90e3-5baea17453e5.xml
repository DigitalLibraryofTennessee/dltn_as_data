  <abstract>A view of some of the three-dimensional exhibit that was on display at the Nashville Children’s Museum, circa January 1954. This was a joint project of the Nashville Association of Model Engineers, the board of directors of the Museum, and the three railroads serving Nashville representing the city’s transportation system and major landmarks, such as Union Station. Mayor Ben West, with his hobby of model trains, helped raise funds for the exhibit. The museum’s collection was housed in a large cut-stone building at 724 Second Avenue South that had once served as the University of Nashville. In addition to educational programming the museum included special exhibits of North American animals, birds, flowers, minerals, fossils, and local history. The museum was active at this site from 1944 to 1973. The children’s museum closed and reopened as the Cumberland Science Museum at the bottom of the hill containing the ruins of Fort Negley. Forms part of Record Group 3, Metro Davidson County Photographer. 1 photograph negative : b &amp; w ; 4 x 5 in.</abstract>
