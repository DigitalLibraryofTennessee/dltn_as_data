  <abstract>An exterior view of the Genesco Park Administration Building (1415 Murfreesboro Road, Nashville, Tennessee), pictured from the porch of Monell’s at the Manor. This six-story concrete and steel building of 290,000 square feet was built in the mid-1960s as the Genesco World Headquarters. The structure was designed in the New Formalism style of modern architecture by John Charles Wheeler &amp; Associates. Genesco was originally founded as the Jarman Shoe Company in 1924 as a footwear manufacturer, they were later renamed the General Shoe Company in the 1930s. Johnston &amp; Murphy was purchased in 1951 and moved operations to Nashville. The company took the name “Genesco” in 1959 under the leadership of W. Maxey Jarman, the son and co-founder J.F. Jarman, when the company began the process of diversification and expansion of the business. Genesco repositioned itself as a retailer and exited the footwear manufacturing business when it closed Johnston &amp; Murphy’s Nashville, TN factory in 2002. Forms part of the Leanne Garland Photograph Collection. 1 digital photograph.</abstract>
