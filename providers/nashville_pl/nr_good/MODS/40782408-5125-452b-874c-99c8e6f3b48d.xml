  <abstract>Pictured: “Neighborhood group piles up scrap: four school children have canvassed the Twenty-eighth Avenue, South, neighborhood with the large pile above resulting. The children are shown as they helped load the nearly 1,000 pounds of salvage on a truck of the Goodwill Industries, to which the children have donated the scrap. They are (left to right) W. E.
