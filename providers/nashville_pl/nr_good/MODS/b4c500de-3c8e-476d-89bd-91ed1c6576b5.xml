  <abstract>A page from a mounted and bound volume of twenty-five pen-and-ink wash drawings, and two pen-and-ink maps of Nashville created by William A. Eichbaum during the 1850s. Eichbaum was a Nashville bookseller and resident for fifty years. This drawing is of Nashville's City Hospital, originally built as a mental hospital in the early 1830s. Known first as Tennessee's Lunatic Asylum, the three-story building designed by David Morrison stood on what is now Twelfth Avenue, South, bounded on the south by Division Street and extending back to Overton Street. In 1847, nationally known mental-health reformer Dorothea Dix visited Tennessee for several weeks and pointed out the need for a better mental care facility. In 1848 state legislators appropriated money for a new mental hospital. In 1852, when the new facility on Murfreesboro Turnpike was complete, patients were transferred, and the old building was transformed into City Hospital. The University of Nashville's medical school operated it and the city helped with funding, but the building remained state-owned. There is no record of the structure being used as a hospital by either army during the Civil War, and later proposals to transform it into the governor's mansion never came to fruition. Forms part of the William A. Eichbaum Sketchbook Collection. 1 drawing : col. ; 5.75 x 9 in.</abstract>
