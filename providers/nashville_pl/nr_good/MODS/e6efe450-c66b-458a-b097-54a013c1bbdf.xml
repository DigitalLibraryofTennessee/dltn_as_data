  <abstract>Nashville Banner reporter Dick Battle (pictured on right) and two photojournalists on a helicopter flight at the airport, November 1954. Battle came to Nashville from his native St. Louis in 1916. He graduated from Goodlettsville High School in 1925. Battle next studied as a draftsman and commercial artist at Washington University in St. Louis. He returned to Nashville and joined the staff of the “Evening Tennessean” in 1932. He became a reporter for the “Banner” for 40 years, beginning in 1933 as a police reporter and graduating to the City Hall beat in 1937. His “City Hall” column gained a wide readership over the years and he became well known in the community. He retired from news reporting in 1973, and later worked with former Mayor Beverly Briley as a public relations consultant. Forms part of Record Group 3, Metro Davidson County Photographer. 1 photograph negative : b &amp; w ; 4 x 5 in.</abstract>
