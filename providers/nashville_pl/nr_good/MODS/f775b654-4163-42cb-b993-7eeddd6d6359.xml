  <abstract>An exterior view showing the Negro Branch of the Carnegie Library, in Nashville, Tennessee, circa 1916. This branch library opened at the southeast corner of Twelfth Avenue North and Hynes Street on February 10, 1916. It was among the four Nashville public libraries that Andrew Carnegie built in partnership with the city. The opening ceremony was held under the auspices of the Nashville Negro Board of Trade and the Carnegie Library Board of Nashville. The library was planned as a center of community life and learning, a place where many civic organizations met, such as the Colored Women's Chapter of the American Red Cross, a World War I service organization. The building was a two-story classical revival structure containing two large reading rooms, a large auditorium, and smaller meeting rooms. The head librarian was Miss Marian McKenzie Hadley, a graduate of Fisk University. Her assistant, also a Fisk graduate, was Hattie Louise Watkins. The architects were Robert Sharp and C. K. Colley. The building was constructed of brick and stone. This branch closed in 1949 and was succeeded by the Hadley Park Public Library branch in 1952. Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph : b &amp; w ; 9.5 x 7.75 in.</abstract>
