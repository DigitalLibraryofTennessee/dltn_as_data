  <abstract>An interior view of the George Reyer Pumping Station located in Nashville, Tennessee, October, 1952. The George Reyer Pumping Station (located on Omohundro Drive) and the Eighth Avenue Reservoir were built in 1889. Both the pumping station, powered by steam until 1953, and the Eighth Avenue Reservoir are still in operation today and are included in the National Registry of Historical Places. A water filtration plant was completed at Omohundro Drive in 1929. The K.R. Harrington Water Treatment Plant, located on Heartland Drive in Donelson, joined the Omohundro Treatment Plant in supplying safe, clean water to the Nashville area in 1978. The George Reyer Pumping Station was named in honor of Captain George Reyer, a Water Works superintendent for over 41 years. Presently, Metro Water Services, officially known as the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County, Department of Water and Sewerage Services is responsible for operation of the Omohundro Water Plant in addition to the vast network of water mains that provide service. Forms part of Metro Archives Record Group 100 City Water Works Collection. 1 b &amp; w photograph.</abstract>
