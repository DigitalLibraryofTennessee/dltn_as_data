  <abstract>Pictured: “Cavert School loads vital scrap: this is only one of many truckloads of much needed scrap metal that has been collected and transported to junk dealers by the students of Calvert School, one of the contestants in the Banner scrap drive. A total of 10,000 pounds has been rounded up by Cavert students since the opening of the drive, with much more to come. Paul Weinstein serves as Junior Service Army “colonel” at Cavert, G. T. Ely is faculty sponsor for the scrap campaign at the school.” During World War II Americans were active with scrap drives to help the war effort. Local communities were salvaging raw materials such as metal, rags, rubber, and paper to be used to supply troops. These special home front war programs were often well-coordinated through committees that engaged widespread urban and rural participation and motivated patriotism and community spirit.
