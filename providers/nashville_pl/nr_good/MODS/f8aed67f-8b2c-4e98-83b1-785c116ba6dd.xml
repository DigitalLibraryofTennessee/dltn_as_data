  <abstract>Pictured left to right: Nashville Mayor Ben West, Yanosuke Yoshioka, Yasuma Oda, Kyo Kanedo, Stephen Klausner (president of Genescoâ€™s Intercontinental Shoe Company), and Toshinoshin Sakurai. The four Japanese shoe manufacturing officials were in Nashville during their ten-day tour and inspection of the Nashville business on March 9th, 1961. They were awarded gold keys and honorary citizenship of Nashville by Mayor Ben West. Genesco was originally founded as the Jarman Shoe Company in 1924 as a footwear manufacturer, they were later renamed the General Shoe Company in the 1930s. The company took its current name, Genesco, in 1959. Under the leadership of W. Maxey Jarman, the son of co-founder J.F. Jarman, the company began the process of diversifying and expanding the business into an international apparel conglomerate.
