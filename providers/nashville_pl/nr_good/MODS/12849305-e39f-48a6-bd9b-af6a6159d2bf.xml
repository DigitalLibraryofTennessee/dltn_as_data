  <abstract>A photograph of Charlotte Avenue Church of Christ, built in 1921. This church is located at 4508 Charlotte Avenue, Nashville Tennessee. It is the second structure erected to house its members at the corner of Charlotte and Forty-sixth Avenues. Originally, the church was called West Nashville Christian Church and in 1892 a thirty-by-fifty foot building was erected as a modest place for worship. By 1920 the congregation had outgrown this building and construction began on the current church in March of 1921. By October of that same year the first service was held in the new building. In the 1950s some additions were made to the 1921 structure, including an enlarged auditorium that seats 1,515 and a smaller chapel for weddings and funerals. The foundation of the church is made of stone blocks. The exterior walls are yellow brick. The roof is made of asphalt shingles. The windows are stained glass. The doors are solid wood painted white. Special features include a square brick tower attached to the main church. Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4 x 6 in.</abstract>
