  <abstract>A photograph of Rev. Samuel Porter Jones (1847-1906), one of the most celebrated revivalists of the late 19th century. This American Methodist was born in Alabama and reared in Cartersville, George. He is significantly connected with the history of The Union Gospel Tabernacle, later named Ryman Auditorium in downtown Nashville, Tennessee. Rev. Jones was married to Laura McElwain Jones and they had seven children. It was in Nashville, during a revival meeting, that riverboat captain Thomas Green Ryman (1841-1904) was converted after hearing Rev. Jones on May 10th, 1885. According to legend, Ryman decided on that day to build a religious tabernacle in which to hold revival meetings in Nashville, Tennessee to promote temperance and Christian evangelism. The Ryman building later became home to the Grand Ole Opry for many years. This photographic portrait of Rev. Jones was made at the photographic studio of McCrary &amp; Branson, Knoxville, Tennessee. Forms part of the Helon Daniel Miller Collection. 1 cabinet card.</abstract>
