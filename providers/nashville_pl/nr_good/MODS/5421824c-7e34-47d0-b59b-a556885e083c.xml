  <abstract>A photograph of Mt. Ararat Missionary Baptist Church currently located at 36 Fairfield Avenue in Nashville, Tennessee. Originally this building was listed as Mt. Ararat Baptist Church at 34 Fairfield Avenue. The congregation was founded in approximately 1903 with only twelve members. The first building was built in 1905, but eventually burned in a fire. The present church was erected in 1958 on the same land. The foundation is made of brick. The exterior walls are red brick with stone surrounding the rectangular windows. The roof is made of tar shingles and gabled. The windows are tall and made of colored glass. The doors are glass with metal frame. Other architectural features include a steeple and a tall staircase leading up to the front doors. Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4 x 6 in.</abstract>
