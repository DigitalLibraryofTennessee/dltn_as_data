  <abstract>An exterior view of Alex Green Elementary School, located at 4020 Whites Creek Pike, Nashville, Tennessee, circa March 1981. The first school in the Whites Creek community was held in a building called Temperance Hall, on the ground now occupied by the Alex Green Church parsonage. The first school house was built in the late 1800s on property owned by Mr. Tim Manlove. In 1887 the county bought the property and changed the name to Alex Green Academy in honor of Miss Julia Greenâ€™s grandfather, the late Rev. Alexander Little Page Green, an eminent Methodist minister and a prominent landowner in the community. About 1913 the two-room building was remodeled and two more rooms were added to the front. In 1922 the school became a high school and remained so for three years. In 1936 the old frame building was replaced by a modern brick building with four classrooms. The enrollment was enlarged by absorbing two one-teacher schools, Weaver School on Whites Creek Pike and Buena Vista School on Buena Vista Pike. In 1952 the cafeteria, kitchen and two-classrooms were added, then subsequently eight portable classroom structures. Forms part of the Claynita Harris Slide Collection. The original is a 35 mm color transparency (2 x 2 in. slide mount)</abstract>
