  <abstract>A photograph of First Baptist Church East Nashville. This African American church was founded in 1866 by the Reverend Randall B. Vandavall, a slave born on March 23, 1832 at Neely's Bend. In the early years, the church was called Vandavall's Baptist Church, as the pastor was such an influential leader in the community. First Baptist Church East Nashville was officially chartered on November 13, 1882, by Vandavall, Henry Gasoway, Austin Roberts, Granville Batts, Hezekiah Harding, and George W. Newsom. The present church structure was built in 1928 on the corner of Main and Sixth streets. It was expanded in 1931 and continuously improved, especially from 1934 through 1941. The front entrance of the church was restructured due to the widening of Main Street during the 1960s. Built in a Classical Revival design, this church building contains an education department, a sanctuary seating 600, a pipe organ, melodic chimes, a mural by Tennessee State University professor and artist Frances Thompson, and memorial windows. The foundation is made of rough cut stone. The exterior walls are red brick with tan brick accents at the top. The roof is gabled with tar shingles. The doors are metal. Special features include concrete columns at the entrance. Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : col. ; 4 x 6 in.</abstract>
