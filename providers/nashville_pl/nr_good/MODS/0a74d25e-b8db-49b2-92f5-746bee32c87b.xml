  <abstract>A postcard of the War Memorial Building on Memorial Plaza stretching between Union Street and Charlotte Avenue, and from Sixth to Seventh Avenues. This building was built by the state, county and city in 1925 to honor the Tennesseans who served in World War I. Since then, the memorial has come to commemorate those Tennesseans who fought in all wars. The architect and designer for this project was Nashville architect Edward Dougherty, affiliated as an associate with McKim, Mead, and White of New York on the design. The granite and marble building in Greek Doric style has a large open memorial courtyard that contains a massive sculpture created by Belle Kinney and Leopold Scholz. Two wings extend from the open court housing government offices, a 2,200 seat auditorium and the Tennessee State Museum's military collection. Also by Kinney is a large sculpture honoring Tennessee women during the Civil War. In 1985 a memorial to Tennessee's Vietnam veterans was added. This includes a black granite wall with names and a bronze sculpture. Forms part of the Nashville Room Postcard Collection. 1 postcard : col. ; 3.5 x 5.5 in.</abstract>
