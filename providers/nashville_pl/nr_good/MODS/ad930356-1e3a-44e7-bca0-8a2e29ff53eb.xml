  <abstract>The 1910 yearbook, known as “Salmagundi,” published by Boscobel College for Young Ladies, featuring students, faculty, trustees, clubs, athletics, societies, and more. Boscobel College for Young Ladies was a college in East Nashville, founded in 1889 as the Nashville Baptist Female College by the Tennessee Baptist Convention. The college operated for twenty-five years--until 1914. The campus was built around an East Nashville mansion, formerly owned by Anna Shelby Williams. The mansion stood atop a tree-covered hill overlooking the Cumberland River. The campus covered ten wooded acres on Sevier Street near South Seventh Street (then called Foster Street), south of Sylvan Street. In 1918, the property became home to the National Baptist Seminary and Missionary Training School, which functioned until 1931. The buildings were razed in 1940. Several Nashville businesses are advertised, including: T.J. Mooney Co.; Geo. R. Calhoun &amp; Co.; Phillips &amp; Buttorff’s Manufacturing Co.; Fourth National Bank; Nashville Railway &amp; Light Co.; DeMoville Drug Company; H.A. French Music Publisher; Harris, Davis &amp; Company “wholesale dry goods, notions and furnishing goods;” Foster, Webb &amp; Parkes; Howe’s Distilled Water; Overton &amp; Bush Coal, Coke, Kindling; M. Cook &amp; Company; Joy Floral Co.; Cumberland Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company; W.J. Cude Land &amp; Lumber Company; Loventhal, Frank &amp; Company “the exclusive boys’ outfitters;” B.H. Stief Jewelry Co.; Tulane Hotel; Standard Printing Company; Jesse French Piano &amp; Organ Co.; Union Bank &amp; Trust Company; Corbitt “makers of high grade photos;” American Dry Cleaning Co.; W.C. Tucker “importer and dealer in white china and artists’ materials;” Jones &amp; Hopkins Manufacturing Co.; Phillips &amp; Co.; Herbrick &amp; Lawrence; Thuss Photographers; Warren Brothers Co.; Jack Walters “wholesale deal and shipper of fine strawberries and early southern vegetables;” Crone &amp; Jackson; H.G. Hill Grocer &amp; Baking Co.; Dury’s Photo Stock House; W.C. Williams &amp; Co.; Holbrook &amp; McClellan; M.E. Derryberry &amp; Co.; White Trunk &amp; Bag Co.; The Rice Bureau; and, Love, Boyd &amp; Co. “in the market for all kinds of hardwood lumber.” Note that in the Clubs Section, i.e. “Human Lemon Club,” has several member names listed under a yellow lemon: Corinne Measle, Gladys Sullivan, Imogen Gregg, Muriel Waggoner, Daisy Borden, Hazel Frazier, and Mary Bradley, with the sentiment “It is more blessed to give than to receive.” Forms part of the yearbook collection: Boscobel College, “Salmagundi,” 1910. 1 volume</abstract>
