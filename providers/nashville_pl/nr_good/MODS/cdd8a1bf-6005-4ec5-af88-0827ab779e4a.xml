  <abstract>A view of the moonshine distillery “raided by Federal Alcoholic Tax Unit Officers C. I. Nelson and R. R. Tubb and Special Investigator F. F. Haddix. The plant was located just off Old Hickory Boulevard between Whites Creek Pike and the County quarry …. The plant, which had been in operation not more than thirty days, was described by federal officers as being a ‘two-in-one’ unit. While one unit of the distillery was in operation, the other was refilling, thus making the plant constantly in operation. Confiscated were sixty gallons of whisky, the 200-gallon still, 1,000 pounds of ice, and 4,000 gallons of mash. The still was serviced by a large truck.” Source: Nashville Banner, July 17, 1941, page 19.
