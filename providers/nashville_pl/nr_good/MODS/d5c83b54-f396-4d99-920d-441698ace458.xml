  <abstract>A celebration at the Nashville Airport in front of the American Airlines Astojet. Pictured left to right are: Judge Beverly Briley, unidentified man, and Mayor Ben West, celebrating the jet flight out of Nashville on June 11th, 1961. The signage reads “Nashville’s Gateway to the Jet Age, Athens of the South.” American and Eastern airlines were the first air carriers to serve Nashville. Nashville's airport officially opened in 1937 as Berry Field, in honor of Colonel Harry S. Berry, the state administrator of the Works Progress Administrator, or WPA. Berry Field became the military base for the 4th Ferrying Command during World War II and was returned to the city when the war ended. The airport’s name was officially changed to Nashville International Airport in 1988, but the original three-letters BNA, which stands for Berry Field Nashville, remains. Forms part of Record Group 3, Metro Davidson County Photographer. 1 photograph negative : b &amp; w ; 4 x 5 in.</abstract>
