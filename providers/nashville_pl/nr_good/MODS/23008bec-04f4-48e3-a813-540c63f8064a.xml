His great-grandfather was Anthony Wayne Van Leer, the founder of the iron works, Cumberland Furnace. He was an U. S. Army officer, 1st Lieutenant, 4th Tennessee Infantry in 1898 who served in the Spanish-American War. He transferred to the 9th Infantry in 1900. During his youth, the Drouillard family resided in Dickson County. The family returned to Nashville circa 1886 and resided at a large red brick mansion located at the corner of Vauxhall (Ninth Avenue) and Demonbreun Streets.
