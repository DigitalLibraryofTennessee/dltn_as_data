  <abstract>An exterior view of the Customs House, located at 701 Broadway, Nashville, Tennessee, February 25th, 1976. The cornerstone of the Customs House was laid by President Rutherford B. Hayes on September 19, 1877. Approval for a federal building dates to 1856, but construction delays and the Civil War caused Nashville to wait for more than twenty years for a facility to house federal courts, customs, and post office. Treasury architect William Appleton Potter designed this grand example of the Victorian Gothic style. From its massive yet ornate stone block a central clock tower soars. The many rich details include the Gothic lancet windows and a deeply inset triple-arch entrance. In the 1990s the Customs House was declared surplus property by the federal government and was turned over to Metro Nashville government which worked toward its renovation and reuse. Forms part of Record Group 3, Metro Davidson County Photographer. 1 photograph negative : b &amp; w ; 4 x 5 in.</abstract>
