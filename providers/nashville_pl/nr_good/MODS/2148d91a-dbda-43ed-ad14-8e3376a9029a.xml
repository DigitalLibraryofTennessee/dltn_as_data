  <abstract>A letter from Dutch immigrant Peter J. Williamson back home to his wife, Eunice, during the Civil War. In 1862 Williamson enlisted as a Private in the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, Company F and was ultimately promoted to Full 1st Lieutenant. During the war, Williamson's regiment was involved in scouting and raids in Missouri and Arkansas and saw battle in the Middle Tennessee, Chickamauga, and Atlanta campaigns. In this letter from Bloomfield, Missouri, Williamson discusses his financial debt back in Appleton, Wisconsin, and promises to pay it all off once he gets promoted to 1st Lieutenant. He expects a promotion anytime, and believes he has been delayed in receiving one due to the Colonel's arrest for misconduct. He reports that his dinners consist of bread and milk each night with an occasional slice of cherry pie. He mentions a party thrown by one of the Captains that he attended and describes it as "dry." Lastly he shares that he recently experienced an earthquake that lasted for three minutes. Forms part of the Peter J. Williamson Letters. 1 letter : col. ; 8 x 5 in.</abstract>
