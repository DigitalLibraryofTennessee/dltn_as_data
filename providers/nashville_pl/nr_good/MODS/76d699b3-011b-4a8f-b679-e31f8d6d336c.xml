  <abstract>Mayor Ben West speaking at the Farmers’ Market, September, 1954. Since its inception on the town square in the early 1800’s, the Farmers’ Market has been a vital part of Nashville life. There have been several venues, for example in the early 1800’s Nashville constructed a new City Hall and Market House on the west side of the downtown public square. During the 1930’s, the City Hall, Market House and Courthouse Buildings were demolished to make way for the new Davidson County Courthouse and a new Market House was constructed on the north side of the square. In the mid-1950’s the City moved the Farmers’ Market to a new location just north of Downtown on Jefferson Street. In 1995, the Farmers’ Market was renovated as part of the Bicentennial State Park Mall development. The address of the Farmers’ Market is 900 Rosa L. Parks Boulevard. Forms part of Record Group 3, Metro Davidson County Photographer. 1 photograph negative : b &amp; w ; 4 x 5 in.</abstract>
