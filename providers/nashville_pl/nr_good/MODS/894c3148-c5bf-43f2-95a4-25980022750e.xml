  <abstract>Opened in January of 1940, Carter-Lawrence Elementary was a combination of two previously separate schools. Carter Elementary, containing grades one through six, was located just north of the present site on 12th Avenue South. Lawrence Elementary, containing grades one through three, was located on South Street. Carter was named in memory of Howard C. Carter, a teacher in the Nashville city schools, and Lawrence was named for Judge John Lawrence, a member of the Board of Education. Both schools opened in 1890. 11 x 14 in.</abstract>
