  <abstract>Tarbox School opened in 1880 on 17th Avenue between Hayes Street and West End Avenue. It was named for L.G. Tarbox who served as principal of Hume school. In 1886, a new three story, brick building with a six story bell tower was constructed and opened on Broad Street. George B. Elliot served as the first principal in the new building. A fence with two gates surrounded the school. Boys entered by the west gate, and girls entered by the east gate. On April 1, 1932, a fire destroyed the tower and front of the school building. All students were evacuated safely. The building was rebuilt with only two stories instead of three. The school closed in 1960. 11 x 14 in.</abstract>
