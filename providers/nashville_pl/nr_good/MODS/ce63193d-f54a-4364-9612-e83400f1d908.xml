  <abstract>Cover of photograph album compiled by Loraine O'Connor while her husband, Edward, was serving in the Army Air Forces during World War II. Edward E. O'Connor Jr. was born on Jan. 14, 1915 in Nashville to Edward Earl O'Connor and his wife, Kate. He attended Jere Baxter and Isaac Litton schools in Nashville, and married Loraine Erwin, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Martin P. Erwin of Santa Fe, Tennessee on June 9, 1940 at City Road Chapel Methodist Church in Madison, Tennessee. Edward E. O'Connor, Jr., a native Nashvillian, went into the Army Air Corps early in 1943 and was sent overseas early in 1944. He served as a ball turret gunner aboard the B-24 "Hubba Hubba" with the 415th Bombardment Squadron of the 98th Bombardment Group (Heavy), stationed in North Africa and Italy. According to a government telegram, he was shot down over Austria on Palm Sunday, April 2, 1944; however, Ed always told his family he was shot down over Yugoslavia. He returned to American lines with the help of Tito's partisans. He had been missing in action for 30 days. He soon returned to the U.S. where he continued his military service as a gunnery school instructor. He was discharged in Oct. 1945. Forms part of the Veterans History Project. 1 photograph album (cover).</abstract>
