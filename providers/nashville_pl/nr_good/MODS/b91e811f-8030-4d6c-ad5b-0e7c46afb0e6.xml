  <abstract>Aerial photograph of a portion of North Nashville, in the Jefferson Street area, looking west, circa 1968, taken by Metro Photographer, William M. King. The future route of Interstate 40 is apparent in the areas of cleared ground that run to the west and then turn to the southwest. Predominant roads running toward the west are Jefferson Street and Scovel Street. Two large buildings at middle left are located on the campus of Fisk University. The larger building, with dormers and narrow chimneys visible on the roofline, is Jubilee Hall. The L-shaped building just behind it is Crosthwaite Hall. Just beyond Fisk, to the west, can be seen a building on the Meharry Medical College campus. In the distance, just before the curve of the interstate to the left, can be seen a railroad bridge of the Tennessee Central crossing Jefferson Street. Numerous buildings along Jefferson Street are visible in the foreground and middle distance. Residential areas to the north along Scovel Street and Heiman Street are also visible. Lee Chapel AME church can be seen near the middle of Scovel Street, marking the intersection of 18th Avenue North. In the far distance in the upper right hand corner is the vicinity of Tennessee State University. Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph : b &amp; w ; 8 x 10 in.</abstract>
