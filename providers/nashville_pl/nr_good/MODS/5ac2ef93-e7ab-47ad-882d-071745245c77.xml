  <abstract>A view of the urban area that would later be developed into Riverfront Park, located on the left bank of the Cumberland River at Broad Street and First Avenue N in downtown Nashville, Tennessee. The Park Board requested Mayor Richard Fulton to use specific land to create a riverfront park as a historical project commemorating the Nashville Bicentennial. On November 5, 1980, Sandra (Mrs. Richard) Fulton and Betty Brown co-chairman of a Century III special project committee, presented plans developed by the committee for a riverfront park and requested the assistance of the Park Board in securing federal funding assistance with park development. The Nashville District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, on December 17, 1981, entered into an agreement with city government on a cost-sharing basis for development of the park, the plan costing about $4.2 million. This cost was shared by the federal government and community development funds, with a small amount coming from the Department of Conservationâ€™s Tennessee Land and Conservation Fund. The three-phase park construction program proceeded, and the first phase was completed and opened with a gala riverfront celebration on July 10, 1983. Third phase construction, including a boat dock, was approved at the end of 1984, and was in progress in 1985.
