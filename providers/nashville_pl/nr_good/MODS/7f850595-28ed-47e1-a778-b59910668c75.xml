  <abstract>A letter from Dutch immigrant, Peter J. Williamson, back home to his wife, Eunice, during the Civil War. In 1862 Williamson enlisted as a Private in the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, Company F and was ultimately promoted to Full 1st Lieutenant. During the war, Williamson's regiment was involved in scouting and raids in Missouri and Arkansas and saw battle in the Middle Tennessee, Chickamauga, and Atlanta campaigns. In this letter from near a railroad bridge on the Chattahoochee River in Georgia, Williamson gives a fuller account of McCook's Raid than in his last letter dated August 02, 1864, including a detailed casualty list. He states that the raid is not the disaster the newspapers have been reporting and the reasoning for his opinion. He tells her he has written a report of the raid for the Appleton Crescent that should appear in the next issue. He states he prefers operations other than raids due to the toll such operations take on those involved. He then describes the break out of the forces under General McCook to safety on July 30th. Williamson says his division has been ordered to the rear by General Sherman and that there has been heavy firing at the front in Atlanta. He closes by telling her to have his letter copied if she wishes to keep the original and to publish it in the Crescent for the family and friends of those named in the casualty list. Forms part of the Peter J. Williamson Letters. 1 letter : col. ; 8 x 10 in.</abstract>
