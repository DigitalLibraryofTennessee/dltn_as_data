His newspaper career began in 1885, when he purchased the Nashville Banner. His first wife was Mollie T. Claiborne, who died in 1915. He second wife, whom he married in 1920, was Sarah Shelton. Oil on canvas. Presented to the library in 2002 by Annie Laurie Hunt Berry. The portrait is currently on display in the Nashville Room on the Nashville Public Library's second floor.
