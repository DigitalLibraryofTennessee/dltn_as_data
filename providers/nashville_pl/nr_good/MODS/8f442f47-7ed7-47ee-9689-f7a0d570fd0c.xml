  <abstract>A letter from Dutch immigrant, Peter J. Williamson, back home to his wife, Eunice, during the Civil War. In 1862 Williamson enlisted as a Private in the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, Company F and was ultimately promoted to Full 1st Lieutenant. During the war, Williamson's regiment was involved in scouting and raids in Missouri and Arkansas and saw battle in the Middle Tennessee, Chickamauga, and Atlanta campaigns. In this letter from Bloomfield, Missouri, Williamson details his regiment's movements and the place and people of their current encampment. He also describes General McNeil's colorfully urgent dispatch for reinforcements and the circumstances that were its cause. He explains that the request seemed to be of a political nature and unnecessary. He mentions a report of a possible good "haul" of captured Confederates and materials below Vicksburg and also tells of his regiments drilling regimen and their overall condition. He expresses his anxiety at not having heard from her and implores her to write as soon as possible with news of their well-being. He then tells her of his new horse and closes by once again imploring her to write soon. Forms part of the Peter J. Williamson Letters. 1 letter : col. ; 5 x 8 in.</abstract>
