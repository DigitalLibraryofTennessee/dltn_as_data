  <abstract>A video clip depicting the oil portrait of William Little Brown (1789-1830). Brown studied and practiced law prior to becoming the Solicitor General (1814-1915). He was elected a member of the Tennessee State Senate in 1819. During his time as a member of the Senate, he successfully concluded a treaty concerning the Kentucky/Tennessee boundary line. At the conclusion of his term, Brown returned to Nashville and opened a highly-respected and successful law firm, partnering with Ephraim H. Foster. In 1822, he was elected to be a judge on the Supreme Court. His term was short-lived however, with Brown resigning from the position in 1823. He resigned at a time when many fellow colleagues highly respected both his character and professional reputation. His portrait was presented by "unknown admirers" soon after the establishment of the State Library in 1858. 1 video clip, Metro Archives Portraits Collection.</abstract>
