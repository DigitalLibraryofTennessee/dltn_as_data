  <abstract>A letter from Dutch immigrant, Peter J. Williamson, back home to his wife, Eunice, during the Civil War. In 1862 Williamson enlisted as a Private in the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, Company F and was ultimately promoted to Full 1st Lieutenant. During the war, Williamson's regiment was involved in scouting and raids in Missouri and Arkansas and saw battle in the Middle Tennessee, Chickamauga, and Atlanta campaigns. In this letter from Cleveland, Tennessee, Williamson Tells Eunice he is glad her health is improving rapidly and gives an account of a meal he had the day before. He mentions a Cavalry Review he participated in as reviewed by General Elliot. He then speaks of some military matters and of his wish to go horseback riding with her. He reports that he expects to get paid soon and explains how much he will send and what to do with it. Williamson expresses some religious sentiment and tells her how much he misses her and their sons. He closes by discussing some rumors of their hometown and asks her to write twice a week if she can. Forms part of the Peter J. Williamson Letters. 1 letter : col. ; 8 x 10 in.</abstract>
