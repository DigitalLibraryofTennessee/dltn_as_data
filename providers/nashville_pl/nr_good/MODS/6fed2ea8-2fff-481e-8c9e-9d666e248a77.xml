  <abstract>A postcard of a winding drive in Warner Park, Nashville, Tennessee, dated between 1907 and 1914. The verso reads: "Warner Park, just beyond the city limits, contains 2,550 acres and many miles of beautiful drives and enchanting bridle paths and pleasant foot walks. This park is noted for its natural scenery, consisting of rugged, hilly, Middle Tennessee countryside that has been undisturbed by the hand of man." Edwin and Percy Warner Parks, collectively known as "The Warner Parks," are managed by the Metropolitan Board of Parks and Recreation of Nashville and Davidson County. The Warner Parks are the largest municipally administered parks in Tennessee and together span 2,684 acres of forest and field, located approximately 9 miles from downtown Nashville. These popular parks feature picnic areas, scenic roadways and overlooks, hiking trails, equestrian center and horse trails, cross country running courses, golf courses, athletic fields and other areas of the park. Warner Parks is an important historical community resource that is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Forms part of the Nashville Room Postcard Collection. 1 postcard : col. ; 3.5 x 5.5 in.</abstract>
