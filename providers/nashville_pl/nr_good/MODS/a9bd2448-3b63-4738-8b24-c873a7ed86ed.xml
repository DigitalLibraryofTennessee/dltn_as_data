  <abstract>A photograph of Tuck Hinton Architects office building located at the corner of Elm Street and Fifth Avenue South. Built in 1860, this two-story brick structure in Rutledge Hill was known as Elm Street Methodist Church for over one hundred years. The building was seized by Union forces for use as a hospital during the Civil War. The ornate clock tower cupola of the church was destroyed by fire in 1925, and the damaged front was rebuilt without this original feature. After the gradual shift of population following World War II, attendance slowly declined, and the church closed in 1971. The stained glass windows were removed and placed inside the T.G.I. Friday's restaurant at Elliston Place. In 1987, the building was saved from demolition and carefully rehabilitated for the offices of PMT Services, Inc. Having undergone further internal transformation, the historic structure became home to Tuck-Hinton Architects in 1995. Through all the renovations the character of the original church still shows through in the re-design. Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : b &amp; w ; 4 x 6 in.</abstract>
