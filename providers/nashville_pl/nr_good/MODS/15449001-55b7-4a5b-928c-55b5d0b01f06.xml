  <abstract>A view of the new racetrack at the Fairgrounds Speedway circa July 15th, 1958. This was during a facility improvement period with new seats, new layout, and a new track. The fairgrounds, located approx. one mile south of downtown Nashville, opened in 1891 as Cumberland Park. The park was built as a harness racing track with a grandstand that seated 7,000 people. In 1904 the harness racing track hosted its first automobile race. In 1906 the first Tennessee State Fair was held. Over the years, the fairgrounds have been host to nighttime airplane rides, a swimming pool, an amusement park, and stock car races, among other things. In 1965 a fire at the fairgrounds destroyed several buildings, the grandstands and numerous restaurants. Today the fairgrounds are used for various conferences, expos, and trade shows, along with the annual Tennessee State Fair. Forms part of Nashville Banner Negatives Collection. 1 photographic negative : b &amp; w ; 4 x 5 in.</abstract>
