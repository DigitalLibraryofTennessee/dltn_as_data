  <abstract>A postcard of the Duncan Hotel built in 1889 by wealthy Nashville broker William M. Duncan. This massive brick building was trimmed in stone and occupied a fourth of the block on the southeast corner of Cherry and Cedar Street (now Fourth and Charlotte). An identifying cupola made the building very unique. The Duncan had four floors comprised of forty-five rooms originally booked for three to five dollars per night. Its location made it convenient to both business and entertainment, but after the panic of 1893, competition from new hotels and a shift in business and entertainment to Church Street made the Duncan's location less desirable to visitors. By 1916 the Duncan had closed its doors as a hotel, and the building was remodeled to be used as the new home for the Colored Y.M.C.A. and the Citizens Savings Bank and Trust. The Duncan Hotel building was razed in the early 1970s during downtown urban renewal. Forms part of the Norton Postcard Collection. 1 postcard : col. ; 3.5 x 5.5 in.</abstract>
