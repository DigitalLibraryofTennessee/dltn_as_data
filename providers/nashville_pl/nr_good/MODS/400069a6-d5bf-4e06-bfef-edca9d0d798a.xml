  <abstract>A letter from Dutch immigrant, Peter J. Williamson, back home to his wife, Eunice, during the Civil War. In 1862, Williamson enlisted as a Private in the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, Company F and was ultimately promoted to Full 1st Lieutenant. During the war, Williamson's regiment was involved in scouting and raids in Missouri and Arkansas and saw battle in the Middle Tennessee, Chickamauga, and Atlanta campaigns. In this letter from Patterson, Missouri, Williamson assures his wife that he is well-fed and healthy. He mentions getting pancakes for breakfast and weighing 175 pounds at the present. He speaks of his desire to be discharged honorably, and how he is looked at favorably by the Colonel. He promises never to join another regiment or company and suspects that he will see a promotion within his own regiment before he is mustered out. Williamson briefly discusses finances. He closes by asking about several family members and requesting a lock of hair from Eunice and each of the boys. Forms part of the Peter J. Williamson Letters. 1 letter : col. ; 8 x 5 in.</abstract>
