  <abstract>The historic Glen Leven home of the Thompson family built in 1857 by John Thompson, son of Thomas Thompson, the pioneer settler who signed the 1780 Cumberland Compact at Fort Nashborough and as a Revolutionary War soldier received a land grant where this home would be built. Circa 1911, it was the residence of Mr. and Mrs. John Thompson (featured in the book “Beautiful Country Homes Near Nashville.”) The Jeffersonian details of the construction and design include the Corinthian-topped, fluted entry columns across the front which hold up a balcony. The structure is located in Nashville, Tennessee at 4000 Franklin Road. Glen Leven was used as a field hospital by federal troops. Extensive renovation restyled the interior during the late 19th century. The home was the residence of several generations of Thompson family members before being bought in 1971 by Susan West, a direct descendant of Thomas Thompson. The historic Glen Leven home and its surrounding sixty-five acres were bequeathed by the late Ms. Susan West to the Land Trust of Tennessee for preservation. This digital photo is reproduced from the book “Historical and Beautiful Country Homes Near Nashville,” compiled by Mrs. James E. Caldwell and published in 1911. 1 digital photo, title supplied by cataloger.</abstract>
