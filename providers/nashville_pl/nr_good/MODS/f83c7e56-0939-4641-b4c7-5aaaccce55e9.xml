  <abstract>An historic marker for the “Site of First Store” that reads: “Lardner Clark came from Philadelphia in the early 1780s with ten horses packed with piece goods, needles and pins. He established Nashville’s first dry goods store by 1786, on a site 30 yards east. The building, which served as store, tavern and dwelling, faced south and was known as ‘the house with a piazza.���” This dry goods store was located in downtown Nashville at approximately the same location as the later Washington Manufacturing Company (214-216 Second Avenue). Clark’s deed related to lot 11 which was in the block boundaries of Church, Second Avenue, Clark and First Avenue. Forms part of the Claynita Harris Slide Collection. The original is a 35 mm color transparency (2 x 2 in. slide mount)</abstract>
