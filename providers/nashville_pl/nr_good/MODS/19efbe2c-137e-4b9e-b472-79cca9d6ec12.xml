  <abstract>The Mid-Winter Number, 1919-1920, “The Megaphone,” a student publication of Central High School, Nashville, Tennessee. This publication of Vol. III, number 1, was dedicated in memory of Miss Ruth Glaus "who was called from our midst on February 6, 1920.” The issue includes several writings by students of the high school. Central High School was founded in 1917 as the first public high school in the county system. One of the earliest student government associations in the South began here. Many graduates became city and county political leaders, such as Nashville City Government Mayor Ben West and the first Metro Government Mayor, Beverly Briley. The last graduating class was 1971 after which the school, located in south Nashville on the hill above the State Fairgrounds on Raines Avenue between Wedgewood Avenue, and Southgate Avenue, was torn down and converted to a Public Television Station. Forms part of the Nashville Yearbooks Collection. 1 yearbook.</abstract>
