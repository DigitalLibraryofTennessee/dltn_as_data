  <abstract>Pictured: Mayor Ben West at the Nashville Children’s Theatre on May 22nd, 1961. The Nashville Children’s Theatre was formed by the Junior League of Nashville as an amateur theatre in 1931. At that time, the Junior League was fulfilling a commitment to establish children’s theatre in many U.S. cities. For years, NCT performed in numerous local landmarks, including Belcourt Theatre, and at Vanderbilt and Belmont Universities. In the late 1950s, Ann Stahlman Hill undertook the monumental task of creating a permanent home for NCT, with many other civic-minded individuals, and with her leadership they petitioned legislatures and engaged in fundraising. Nashville Children’s Theatre opened in 1960 at a facility next to the Howard School building and Lindsley Hall. Forms part of Record Group 3, Metro Davidson County Photographer. 1 photograph negative : b &amp; w ; 4 x 5 in.</abstract>
