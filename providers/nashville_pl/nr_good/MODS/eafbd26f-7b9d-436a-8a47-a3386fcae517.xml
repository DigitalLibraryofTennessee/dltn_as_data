  <abstract>An exterior view of the Crieve Hall Elementary School, 498 Hogan Road, Nashville, Tennessee, circa July 1981. Crieve Hall was an old Scottish estate with a large manor house. A replica of the mansion was built off Franklin Road on the John Overton - Travellerâ€™s Rest property in the mid-1800s, and both the subdivision and the school took the name of the mansion. Crieve Hall Elementary School opened in 1955 and was dedicated on May 13, 1956. The one-story brick building was designed to serve grades 1-8. Six rooms were added in 1958; in 1973 the District II offices were added. Forms part of the Claynita Harris Slide Collection. The original is a 35 mm color transparency (2 x 2 in. slide mount)</abstract>
