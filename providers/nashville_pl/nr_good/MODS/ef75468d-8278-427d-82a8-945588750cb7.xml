  <abstract>A monthly newsletter called Contact, created by the Hayes Young Adult Sunday School class at City Road Methodist Church (now City Road Chapel United Methodist Church) located at 601 Gallatin Road South in Madison, Tennessee. The purpose of this newsletter was to provide a way for classmates in Madison, Tenn. to stay in touch with servicemen and women from the church. It was also a means for those in the military to stay informed about their friends back home, and elsewhere overseas. Most issues of the newsletter included an article by Pastor Cullen T. Carter; Sunday School news; prayers; jokes; patriotic and religious hand-drawn illustrations; correspondence to and from members of the class, including individuals who were overseas, stationed in the United States, or families and friends in Madison, Tenn.; addresses for those members serving in the military; and updates on church and community activities, including social events and various charity and war-related activities. This thirty-page June 1944 edition of the newsletter includes much news relating to the Normandy invasion, from persons serving overseas as well as detailed descriptions of what it was like to receive news of the invasion in Madison, Tenn., and the Nashville area. This issue also includes messages from fathers of individuals in the service, in honor of Father's Day. Other short articles include news about rabid squirrels; a brief strike at the DuPont factory; announcement of a letter-writing contest; and the latest gossip about members of the class. Forms part of the Veterans History Project. 1 newsletter: col. ; 8.5 x 11 in.</abstract>
