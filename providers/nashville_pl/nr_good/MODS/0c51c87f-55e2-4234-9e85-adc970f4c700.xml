  <abstract>A view of the Tulane Hotel, located at Church and Eighth Avenue North, NE corner in downtown Nashville, Tennessee circa 1957. This hotel, built in the renaissance revival style, was erected in 1894 as the Nicholson Hotel on the site of the old Nicholson House, a fancy boarding housing beginning in the 1860s and the residence of I. C. Nicholson. In 1896, the hotel, with its renovation and expansion, was renamed the “Tulane” for one of the new owner’s relatives. In 1897, during the Tennessee Centennial Exposition, it held visitors from all over the world. In 1911, Anne Dallas Dudley and several other women met in a parlor of the Tulane Hotel and founded the Nashville Equal Suffrage League, an activist organization in support for the right of women to vote. During the 1940s there were many elegant formal balls, election year celebrations, Christmases, and entertainment for soldiers during World War II. In 1947, Castle Studio, Nashville first major recording studio was established at the site. In the 1950s, National Life and Accident Insurance purchased the building for approximately $850,000. The Tulane closed its doors April 1956 and a few months later this hotel was razed to make way for a parking lot.
