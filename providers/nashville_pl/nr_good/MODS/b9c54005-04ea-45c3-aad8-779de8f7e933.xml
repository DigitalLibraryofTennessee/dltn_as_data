  <abstract>Jesse Clifton Burt, Jr., in middle age, wearing a brown suit and green tie, with his arms crossed. His wedding band and watch are visible. Historian, author, and free-lance writer, Jesse Burt was born in 1921 in Nashville, Tennessee, to Jesse Clifton and Agnes Louise Seals Burt. Burt attended and graduated from Hume-Fogg High School, George Peabody College for Teachers, and Vanderbilt University. In 1946, he married Eleanor Bales Jones. Burt taught history at Presbyterian College in Clinton, South Carolina, Florence State College in Florence, Alabama, and Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, before serving as Dean at Lambuth College in Jackson, Tennessee. In 1956, he began serving as an extension division instructor in history at the University of Tennessee, Nashville Center, and in 1962 became a radio broadcaster. Burt died on 20 November 1976, in Nashville, Tennessee, and is interred in Mt. Olivet Cemetery. Pastel (chalk). Donated to the library by Cholette (aka Susan Loudermilk) in 1983. The portrait is not framed and is currently not on display. The library's portraits were photographed as part of the National Society of The Colonial Dames of America in Tennessee's Tennessee Portrait Project (http://www.tnportraits.org/index.htm).</abstract>
