  <abstract>An exterior view of Carter-Lawrence Elementary School, located at 1110 12th Avenue South. The school is a combination of two previously separate schools: Carter Elementary School (Grades 1-6) was located just north of the present site; Lawrence Elementary School (Grades 1-3) was located on South Street. Carter-Lawrence opened in January of 1940. To the original two-story brick structure eight rooms were added in 1948 and a cafeteria in 1959. Carter-Lawrence School from 1950 to 1958 grew to a point where it was necessary to build another elementary school in the area. Murrell School was built to lighten an enrollment of more than 850 at Carter-Lawrence. From 1964-1969 Carter-Lawrence was involved in the Ford Foundation funded program known as the Nashville Education Improvement Project funded with $3,500,000 for five years. Forms part of the Claynita Harris Slide Collection. The original is a 35 mm color transparency (2 x 2 in. slide mount)</abstract>
