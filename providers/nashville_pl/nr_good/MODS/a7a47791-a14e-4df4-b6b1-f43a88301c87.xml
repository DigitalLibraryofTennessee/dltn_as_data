  <abstract>Pictured: Entertainer Tommy Sands signing the guestbook at the Colemere Club, circa 1958. Thomas Adrian "Tommy" Sands, a popular teen idol of circa 1950s - 1960s, became an overnight sensation when he appeared on the Kraft Television Theater in January 1957 as “The Singin’ Idol,” and his song “Teen Age Crush” reached No. 2 Billboard’s Hot 100 and No. 1 on Cashbox. In 1960 he married Nancy Sinatra and for a time they were the toast of Hollywood until their divorce in 1965. Sands also performed in several films including “Mardi Gras” in 1959, “Babes in Toyland” in 1961, “The Longest Day” in 1962, “Ensign Pulver” in 1964, and “None But the Brave,” in 1965. The music genres Sands performed, besides pop music, included Country, Countrypolitan, Pop Music, and Rockabilly. Sands’ pioneering contribution to the genre of Rockabilly has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame.
