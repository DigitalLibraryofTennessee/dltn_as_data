  <abstract>A letter from Dutch immigrant, Peter J. Williamson, to his wife, Eunice, in the years following the Civil War. In 1862 Williamson enlisted as a Private in the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, Company F and was ultimately promoted to Full 1st Lieutenant. During the war, Williamson's regiment was involved in scouting and raids in Missouri and Arkansas and saw battle in the Middle Tennessee, Chickamauga, and Atlanta campaigns. After the war, he and his family settled in Nashville and he became an architect. In this letter from Nashville, Tennessee, Williamson recommends that Eunice start immediately from San Bernardino to San Jose where she can get the money for her trip home. He believes arrangements with William have been made for the necessary funds and given her expressions of homesickness, he sees no reason to prolong her time there. He reports that Mrs. Dobson's health is not well and that he has no intention of moving unless their rent is raised. Williamson and their sons have been doing some gardening due to the weather and some of their roses are blooming. He instructs Eunice to not let William read the letter and closes by asking her to let him know when she has left for San Jose. Forms part of the Peter J. Williamson Letters. 1 letter : col. ; 8 x 10 in.</abstract>
