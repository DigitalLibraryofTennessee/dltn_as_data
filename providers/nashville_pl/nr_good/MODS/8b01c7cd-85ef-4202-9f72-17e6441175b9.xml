  <abstract>A photograph of the Senior Class of the 1934 Y.M.C.A. Night Law School of Nashville, Tennessee. The law school operated over many decades at Nashville's Downtown Y.M.C.A. (226 7th Avenue North) from circa 1911 until 1986. It was opened by recent graduates of the law school of Vanderbilt University, for the benefit of those unable to attend law classes during the day. It was incorporated under the laws of the State of Tennessee on January 19, 1927, and since that date has conferred the Degree of Doctor of Jurisprudence on approximately 3,200 graduates. The June 1934 Senior Class, pictured in the photograph are (top row, left to right): Clark B. Rollins, J. B. Redmond, Jr., William Frank McCall, Brown P. Dickey, Bernard W. Depierri (next row, left to right): H. R. Young, Mrs. Eunice Golden, Miss John Bostick, James Newton Biles; (next row): Roy E. Thacker, Jr., Mrs. Alberta Fox, Miss Elizabeth Wilson,William A. Miller (Faculty Advisor), Miss Elizabeth Powell, Miss Mildred Lunn, J. W. West, Jr.; (bottom row): Miss Ruth Edwards (Secretary), Joseph Olin White (President), John Demoville Lewis (Vice President). The school officially changed its name to Nashville School of law in 1986 and moved to 2934 Sidco Drive, and then later relocated to a new facility at 4013 Armory Oaks Drive. Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph : sepia ; 8 x 10 in.</abstract>
