  <abstract>The inauguration of Vice Mayor George Harrison Cate Jr. (pictured on right), Nashville, Tennessee, on April 1, 1963. Mr. Cate defeated H. Sanders Anglea in the two-way race for vice mayor of the Metro Council. Mr. Cate, a native of Nashville and an attorney, was a leader in the fight for adoption of the 1962 Metro Charter, debating and speaking of the merits of the proposed consolidation of city-county governments prior to the referendum vote. The consolidation of Metropolitan Nashville and Davidson County Government was the first consolidation of a city and a county government in the nation. Voters elected Beverly Briley mayor, George Cate vice-may, and a council of forty persons and the day the officials took office was the same day that the consolidation of the city and county governments took effect. Mr. Cate graduated from the Vanderbilt Law School and began law practice in 1951. Forms part of Record Group 3, Metro Davidson County Photographer. 1 photograph negative : b &amp; w ; 4 x 5 in.</abstract>
