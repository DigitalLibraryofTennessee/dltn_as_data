  <abstract>A front view of the old Father Ryan High School, located at 2300 Elliston Place in Nashville, Tennessee. This school building was originally constructed circa 1928-29 on land that was once a part of the Elliston family plantation. The Roman Catholic school was named in honor of Father Abram J. Ryan, a beloved 19th century Southern priest and poet. The school traces its historical roots to the Nashville Catholic High School for Boys that opened in September 1925 at 2015 West End Avenue. The Elliston Place campus was active as a parochial school for over sixty years and was the first of two schools in Tennessee to integrate. In 1970, there was an expansion to facilities, when it absorbed Cathedral High School and became Nashville's only coeducational parochial school. In need of further expansion and modernization, the last graduation was held at the Ellison Place campus in the Spring of 1991. During the summer, the school relocated to a new campus located at 700 Norwood Drive in the Oak Hill area of Nashville. The old school building at Elliston Place was razed circa 1995. Photographed by the Nashville architect Charles Wesley Warterfield, Jr. (1926-1998); the architectural photograph forms part of the Charles Warterfield Architectural Collection. Gift of: The Estate of Charles W. Warterfield, Jr., F. A. I. A. The original is a 35 mm color transparency (2 x 2 in. slide mount).</abstract>
