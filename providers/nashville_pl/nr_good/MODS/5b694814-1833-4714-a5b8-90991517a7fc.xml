  <abstract>The Sparkman Street Bridge, later renamed Shelby Street Bridge was completed in 1909, spanning the Cumberland River to link East Nashville to the downtown area. The multi-storied Nashville Bridge Company can be seen in the background on the east side of the river. The Foster &amp; Creighton Company were the contractors for the bridge (specifically Foster-Creighton-Gould Company), a family-owned construction company founded in Nashville circa 1885 by Wilbur Fisk Foster and Robert T. Creighton. Some of their early works included the Parthenon, Union Station, and the Sparkman/Shelby Street Bridges. In 1986, the bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In 2003, the bridge reopened as a pedestrian walkway. The bridge was the first one in North America to have concrete arched trusses. Howard M. Jones, a railroad engineer, was employed by the county as its designer. The original official name was the Broadway Bridge. Forms part of the Foster &amp; Creighton General Contractors Collection. 1 photograph : b &amp; 2 ; 8 x 10 in.</abstract>
