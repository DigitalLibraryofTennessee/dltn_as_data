  <abstract>A photograph of the Central Church of Christ Girls' Home, located at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Commerce Street in Nashville, Tennessee, prior to its razing in 1972. The Girls Home was established in 1927, by the Central Church of Christ, originally established to benefit widows and children as a residence. The church program expanded their service to include young single women from the farms and small towns, who moved to the city to work or go to school. The home was part of the church's programs designed to focus its ministry on the urban poor. The principle planners were Elder Elvin H. Ijams, who later became president of David Lipscomb College, and A. M. Burton, founder of Life &amp; Casualty Insurance Company. The Girls Home was in operation for a span of forty-five years. The Central Church of Christ also provided a dormitory for young men on the upper floors of the church, located nearby at 145 Fifth Avenue North. Photographed by the Nashville architect Charles Wesley Warterfield, Jr. (1926-1998); the architectural photograph forms part of the Charles Warterfield Architectural Collection. Gift of: The Estate of Charles W. Warterfield, Jr., F. A. I. A. The original is a 35 mm color transparency (2 x 2 in. slide mount)</abstract>
