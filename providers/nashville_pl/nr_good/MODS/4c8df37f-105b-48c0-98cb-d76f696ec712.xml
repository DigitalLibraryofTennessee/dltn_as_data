  <abstract>A photograph of the November 14, 1930 bank run on the Tennessee Hermitage National Bank of Nashville, Tennessee (306 Third Avenue North). The photo was taken at about 1 p.m. and the line up at that time extended half a block down Third Avenue and East on Union Street for over half a block. Pictured in front of the bank and the Baxter Building (216 Union Street) the crowd was orderly, as word had been sent down the line that every depositor would be paid in full, if demanded. The bank closed at 2 p.m. with a long line still unable to get in. The Tennessee Hermitage National Bank paid all comers until closing time, but Friday night, effected a consolidation with the Commerce Union Bank. It opened for business the next day under the supervision of the Commerce Union Bank. The Great Depression saw the closing of over 120 southern banks closed in November and December of 1930 and thousands of depositors lost their life savings. Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph : sepia ; 4.75 x 6.75 in.</abstract>
