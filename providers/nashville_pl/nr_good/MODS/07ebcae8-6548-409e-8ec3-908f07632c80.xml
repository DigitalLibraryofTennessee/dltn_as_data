  <abstract>A scene from the Owen Bradley Park in Nashville, Tennessee. Owen Bradley Park: In 1997, the Metro Parks Authority in Nashville dedicated a small public park between 16th Avenue South and Division Street to Owen Bradley, where his bronze likeness sits at a bronze piano. Owen Bradley Park is at the northern end of Music Row. Owen Bradley was one of the most influential country music producers of the 1950s and 1960s. He was vice president of Decca Records’ Nashville Division, and in that position he was able to produce a huge variety of artists, including Conway Twitty, Kitty Wells, and Webb Pierce. Throughout the ‘60s and ‘70s, Bradley worked with many of Decca’s most famous artists, including Loretta Lynn and other famous singers. In 1974, Bradley was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. Forms part of Metro Archives Record Group 327, Metro Parks and Recreation Collection. 1 color photograph.</abstract>
