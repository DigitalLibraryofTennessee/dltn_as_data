  <abstract>A photograph of the Tennessee Press Association at the meeting held at Jackson, Tennessee in 1893. A few of the attendees are identified in a 1970 typescript letter by Donald Miller, a retired priest of the Episcopal Church who is pictured in this photograph as a child, as well as his father, Robert J. G. Miller and his younger brother, Robert. He cites the known names, while others are not identified. In the front row: Mr. Cunningham of the "Confederate Veteran," "Pink" Webb, Herman Haslock, Colonel Slatter, and Battle Clark (a staff member of the Nashville Banner). Second row: Eric Tatum, Donald Miller (9 years old), Robert, (his brother at age 7), Colonel Tatum of the Nashville American, Colonel Wright of Memphis. Top row: Robert J. G. Miller (Editor of the Nashville Banner and for many years treasurer of the Association). Miller states in his letter: "That night they all sat in chairs on the pavement outside the hotel and sang. One song was 'He that hath no Lydia Pinkham's pink pills for pale people and giveth his neighbor none, Shan't have any of my Lydia Pinkham's pink pills for pale people when his Lydia Pinkham's pink pills are gone. Oh, let us be joyful, joyful, oh, let us be joyful.' This was followed with a great burst of laughter - I remember it after 77 years. Oh, those were great days, full of innocent fun. In all the years I attended I never heard an angry or offensive word. They were all gentle-men." Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph : sepia ; 7.5 x 9 in.</abstract>
