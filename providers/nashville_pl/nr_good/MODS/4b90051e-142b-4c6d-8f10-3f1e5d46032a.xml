  <abstract>Nashville Mayor Ben West at the Sulphur Dell ballpark (pictured center at the microphone) officially announcing “Jim Turner Day” circa April 1953. Standing to the mayor’s immediate right and left are Jim Turner, the New York Yankees Pitching Coach and Tennessee Governor Frank G. Clement, with two unidentified men alongside them. James Riley Turner (August 6, 1903 – November 29, 1998) was a pitcher and coach in Major League Baseball. Turner, a native of Antioch, Tennessee, was known as “Milkman Jim” for working in his family's dairy business during the off seasons. Turner made his major league debut in 1937 with the Boston Braves, went on to pitch for the Yankees in relief, and finished his career as a pitching coach for the Yankees and the Reds. Most notably, he was pitching coach for the New York Yankees under Casey Stengel from 1949 to 1959, during which time they won seven titles. Turner also managed the Nashville Vols for one season in 1960. Apart from his baseball career, Turner was a lifelong resident of Nashville, Tennessee.
