  <abstract>A photograph of The Wallace University School baseball squad, Nashville, Tennessee, between 1914 and 1933. This university preparatory school was founded in 1886 by headmaster Clarence B. Wallace, who had earned his M. A. at the University of Virginia. Professor Wallace advanced the principles of scholarship and character in the school's mission and trained students in preparation for Vanderbilt University. It was sponsored by the Presbyterian School and for a time was known as "The Presbyterian School," and also "The University School," or generally known as "The Wallace School." The school was originally located in downtown Nashville and later, circa 1914, the school moved to an old brick house at 2006 West End Avenue. Professor Wallace closed the school and retired in 1941. In October 1949, many of his former students honored the headmaster with a ninetieth birthday celebration at the Maxwell House Hotel. Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph : sepia ; 7.5 x 9.5 in.</abstract>
