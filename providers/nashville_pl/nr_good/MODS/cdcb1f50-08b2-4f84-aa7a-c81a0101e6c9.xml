His parents moved to Marshall County when he was a child, for fifteen years, then returned to Williamson County. At the age of 20 he studied medicine, graduating in the Medical Department of the University of Nashville in 1861. After several years practicing medicine, he was elected Mayor of Lewisburg in 1870, which position he held until his removal to Nashville three years later. In 1875 he was elected a member of the Nashville City Council, holding the office of President of this body for six years. In 1892 he was elected City Health Officer, which position he held for six years. For a number of years we held the Chair of Theory and Practice of Medicine in the Meharry Medical College. He was a member of the North High Street Methodist Church. Shortly after receiving his degree of M.D., he married Miss Mary E. Cochran, of Pontotoc, Mississippi.
