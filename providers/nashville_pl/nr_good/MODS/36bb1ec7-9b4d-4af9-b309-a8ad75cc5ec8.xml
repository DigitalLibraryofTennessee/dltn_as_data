  <abstract>Otto Griebling and Prince Paul, and a striped tiger, with the Robbins Bros. circus that played in Nashville on August 29th, 1938. This photo was published in Nashville Banner with the caption: “Clowns, trapeze artists, equestriennes, and all the circus folk busily preparing today for the matinee and night performances of Robbins Brothers Circus. Otto Griebling, Senior clown of the troupe of forty, is shown ... putting on the type of make-up he has used since he entered the business in 1912. With him is Prince Paul, the midget clown whose smiles have amused circus enthusiasts for the past twelve years. One of Clyde Beatty’s sleek striped tigers may be seen in the lower picture, appearing a bit bored by the whole parade proceedings. Perhaps the crowds no longer amuse him after many years of trouping, but he drew gasps from spectators who found his presence alarming despite the bars at the cage.” The Robbins Bros. Circus performed on August 29th playing at a lot across Fourth Avenue from the Fairgrounds. The event included elephants and riders, bareback riders, clowns and all, with a tremendous preparation setting up for the big shows and parades.
