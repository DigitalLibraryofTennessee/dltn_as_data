  <abstract>A photograph of Monroe Street United Methodist Church located at 700 Monroe Street in Nashville, Tennessee. This church was built in 1906 as indicated on its cornerstone; however, the congregation was first founded in 1868. This brick church is nestled in the historic Germantown neighborhood now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Over the years the structure has undergone many renovations and repairs. Most notable is the restoration project to repair the damages caused by the 1998 tornado. After the disaster, an engineer determined that structural damage to the church was accelerating the decline of the beam supporting the roof, which put the building in danger of collapsing. The congregation relocated to a church member's home situated right across the street from the sanctuary. After two years enough money was raised to make the proper repairs, and the church doors re-opened. The foundation is made of stone. The walls are red brick with terra cotta detailing above the windows. The windows are stained glass with a protective layer of plexi-glass on the outside. The doors are wood. Special architectural features include towers and arches. Forms part of the Historic Nashville, Inc. Sacred Sites Survey Project. 1 photograph : b &amp; w ; 4 x 6 in.</abstract>
