  <abstract>The complete 1899 yearbook publication of the Nashville College for Young Ladies. This institution was a leading Southern School for the advanced education of women. The campus, located on Broad and Vauxhall Streets, was comprised of three large brick buildings covering ½ acre of ground. These campus buildings were erected circa 1882, 1888, and circa 1890s. In September 1880, Rev. George W.F. Price, D.D., of Alabama, opened a school at his own expense on South Spruce Street with the assurance that if it proved successful the means would be forthcoming for its enlargement. The growth of the school steadily increased from 104 students in 1881 to 425 students in 1892. In November, 1882, Dr. Price’s School was removed to its new location on Vauxhall Street (Ninth Avenue South). Financial support was received from the Methodists of Nashville as a center of Southern Methodism. At one point later in time, Vanderbilt University bought the three buildings, converting two of them to apartments, locally known as the Vauxhall Apartments. The other building became the Vanderbilt School of Dentistry. In subsequent years the buildings were razed and the Federal Courthouse was established on the site.
