  <abstract>A cabinet card portrait photograph of Captain Pleas A. Smith, a Confederate veteran of the American Civil War. He was born in Nashville, Tennessee on the 10th of November, 1841, and was raised on the "Ewing Farm" six miles south of Nashville. At the start of the Civil War, Smith resided in Mississippi but soon returned to Tennessee, and on the 3rd day of June, 1861, he joined Captain F. N. McNairy's cavalry company, which subsequently became Company A of First Tennessee Battalion, and on reorganization, Company A, Second Tennessee Cavalry. He served as private in Company A until the reorganization at Jacinto, Mississippi, May 14th, 1862, when he was elected brevet second lieutenant. When the First and Seventh Battalions were consolidated he was recommended by Colonel Barteau as commissary, and acted in that capacity for several months, but being under twenty-one years old he did not receive his commission. Having rejoined Company A some time previous, he was with it on the expedition into West Tennessee, under General Armstrong, in August and September, 1862. Smith was in command of the sharp-shooters at Medon and Britton's Lane. He was then assigned as purchasing officer of General Armstrong's cavalry, which position he held until after the battle of Iuka, Mississippi. By request of Colonel Barteau, Lieutenant Smith rejoined the regiment and assumed the duties of adjutant of the Second Tennessee in October, 1862. He served as adjutant until the spring of 1864. In June, 1864, Smith was assigned to duty on General T. H. Bell's staff as acting assistant inspector-general, where he remained until the final surrender of Forrest's cavalry at Gainesville, Alabama, May 9th, 1865. When the war closed he returned home, near Nashville, Tennessee. He married Miss Martha T. Hamilton, daughter of James W. and Mary E. Hamilton, on the 18th of October, 1866. They raised a son and three daughters. In 1888, the Second Tennessee held its reunion at his residence. Verso of cabinet card: "From the Studio of Thuss, Koellein, &amp; Giers, 318 Union Street, Nashville, Tenn." Also, a handwritten annotation: "Captain Pleas Smith who posed for the Confederate monument at Mt. Olivet." Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 cabinet card photograph : sepia ; 4 x 6.5 in.</abstract>
