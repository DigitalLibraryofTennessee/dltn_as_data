  <abstract>An autographed hand-signed photograph of Joseph T. Macpherson, a Metropolitan Opera Company bass-baritone, from Amqui, Tennessee. This photograph is inscribed to his Nashville voice teacher Signor G. S. de Luca with the notation: "To Signor G. S. de Luca, my sincere Friend and only Teacher, to whom I owe all appreciation for his devoted service and interest in my behalf-Faithfully, Joseph T. Macpherson" and dated "March 1927." Macpherson studied under Signor de Luca for three years at Ward-Belmont college until he joined the Metropolitan Opera in New York in 1926. He made his debut in December of that year as the Pharaoh in Aida. On April 22, 1927 the singer returned triumphantly to Nashville for a recital at the Ryman Auditorium and was given a hero's welcome. Macpherson decided to return to Nashville after the 1931-32 season with the Metropolitan Opera Company. In Nashville, he worked at WLAC and WSM radio stations, and the Tennessee Inspection Bureau, later known as the Insurance Office of Tennessee. Macpherson was a longtime member of the Hillsboro Church of Christ. He died at age nine-two on 4 September 1991 and was survived by two sons, four grandchildren, and a great-grandchild. Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph : b &amp; w ; 7 x 9 in.</abstract>
