  <abstract>A portrait photograph of Elizabeth Burgess Buford, a prominent educator and founder of Buford College, a school for young ladies that was first established in Clarksville, Tennessee in the 1880s and subsequently moved to Nashville in 1901. This photograph of Mrs. E. G. Buford, President, appears in the school's 1912 yearbook "The Mirror." Elizabeth Burgess Buford was born in Cornersville, Marshall County, Tennessee, a daughter of J. J. H. and Elizabeth R. Burgess. According to the 1900 Federal Census, she was then 46 years old and wife of [Elbridge Gerry] Buford at their residence in Clarksville, Tennessee. He served as regent of Buford College, while she held the office of president. Mrs. Buford spent her entire career in the educational field. She graduated A. B. from the Columbia Athenaeum and taught at Webb School and the University of Nashville. She served as lady principal at Martin College in Pulaski, Tennessee and at Dr. Price's School for Young Ladies in Nashville. In 1901 she came to Nashville to start Buford College. The campus was located west of Franklin Road, near the intersection of Caldwell Lane and General Bate Drive, near Buford Place. The yearbooks describe the acreage as "a magnificent highland park of 25 acres, surrounded by an 85 acre woodland, with springs, wells, and a cistern, upon a fine electric car line." The enrollment was limited to 100 girls between the ages of 16 and 20. The college subsequently relocated twice more in Davidson County. At age 71, Elizabeth Buford, the president of Buford College, passed away on February 12th, 1920, and was buried next to her husband at their grand tombstone at Mount Olivet Cemetery. Buford College closed in 1920. Forms part of the Nashville Room Historic Photographs Collection. 1 photograph, mounted in an oval shaped paper frame : sepia ; 8 x 10 in.</abstract>
