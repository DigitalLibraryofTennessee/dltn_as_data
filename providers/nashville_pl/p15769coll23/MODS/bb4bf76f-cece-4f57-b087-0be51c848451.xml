  <abstract>2008 program for the 91st Annual Women's Day Spruce Street Baptist Church in Nashville, Tennessee. The program includes a black and white portrait of Nannie Helen Burroughs. Nannie Helen Burroughs (1879 - 1961) was an educator, religious leader, orator, and prominent advocate for woman suffrage. She helped establish the National Association of Colored Women (NACW) and founded the National Training School for Women and Girls in Washington, DC. In 1906 in Memphis, at the Women's Auxiliary for the National Baptist Convention, she established the National Women's Day to be held annually on the fourth Sunday of July. Its mission was to promote education, missionary work, and leadership for women in the church. In 1915, she published an essay in support of woman suffrage in The Crisis Magazine, the publication for the NAACP. In her essay, she argued that African American women should be given the vote because they were the only ones capable of protecting black women. This was an argument among some African American suffragists, who maintained that white and Black men were susceptible to corruption and that white women were only self interested, and therefore none would be able to understand or prioritize the needs and safety of African American women.</abstract>
