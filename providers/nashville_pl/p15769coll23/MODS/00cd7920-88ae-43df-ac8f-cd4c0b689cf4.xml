  <abstract>Black and white photograph of Annie Sybil Thomas Jarrett at a class reunion at Lane College in 1960. She is wearing a dress with gloves and a flower corsage on the breast of the frock. Annie Sybill Thomas Jarrett (1881 - 1975) was a teacher and lifelong member of the Republican Party. She was born near Saulsbury, Tennessee. She is the daughter of Harriet and John Thomas Sr. She attended Clay Street School in Memphis, Tennessee, which later became the site of Booker T. Washington High School. She graduated with a degree in education from Lane College. She advocated in her community and schools for the teaching of African American history. According to family tradition, she urged family members to vote Republican to honor Abraham Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation. Inscription on the reverse of the photograph reads, "Compliments of Dr. Eugene Ching, Class Reunion, May 21, 1960 -- At Lane." The inscription on the photograph is in the penmanship of Annie Sybil Thomas Jarrett. She attended school Saturdays at Lane College in Jackson, Tennessee over many years. Lane College began as CME High School in 1882, later becoming Lane College in 1896. It is a private, historically black college. Descendants note that Annie Sybil Thomas Jarrett graduated in the late 1930s or early 1940s, with a degree in education. She taught in Obion, Trenton, Union City, and Saulsbury. She retired after working at Henry County Training School in Paris, Tennessee. She also did coursework at Tennessee State University in Nashville.</abstract>
