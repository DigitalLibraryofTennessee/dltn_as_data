  <abstract>Black and white photograph of the eighth grade graduating class of Greenwood Elementary School. The children are on the outside of the building, lined up in five rows with the girls in the middle and boys on the outside. The girls are all wearing light colored dresses. Lovelle Fouse Jenkins is circled on the photograph. Greenwood Elementary School was located at Greenwood CME Church. This school eventually became Hamilton High School located in South Memphis. Greenwood CME is the second oldest CME church in Memphis, the school and church operated out of the same building for the early history of the church. It was organized in 1872, and continues to operate on Kimball Avenue. Lovelle Fouse Jenkins was an awarded educator, pioneering black librarian, and church leader in Memphis, Tennessee. She served in the Shelby County school system for over 40 years, founded three separate libraries, and participated in the 1965 U.S. Office of Education study on the desegregation of schools in Tennessee. She was born in Haywood County, Tennessee on July 24, 1923. Her family moved to Memphis a year later, taking the L &amp; N Train. She attended Greenwood Elementary School, Booker T. Washington High School, and graduated from LeMoyne Owen, the only historically black college in Memphis. She died January 19, 2007.</abstract>
