  <abstract>Black and white studio photograph of Annie Sybil Thomas Jarrett standing in front of a studio background, depicting a richly decorated room. She wears a long dark colored skirt, light colored long sleeved blouse, and ornate hat. The photograph was taken by James P. Newton, the first black photographer in Memphis, whose works are very rare. Annie Sybill Thomas Jarrett (1881 - 1975) was a teacher and lifelong member of the Republican Party. She was born near Saulsbury, Tennessee. She is the daughter of Harriet and John Thomas Sr. She attended Clay Street School in Memphis, Tennessee, which is now the current site of the Booker T. Washington High School. She graduated with a degree in education from Lane College. She advocated in her community and schools for the teaching of African American history. According to family tradition, she urged family members to vote Republican to honor Abraham Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation.</abstract>
