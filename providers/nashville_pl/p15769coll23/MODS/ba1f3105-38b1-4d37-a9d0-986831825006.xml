  <abstract>Cover, title page, and selected pages from the 1942 American Red Cross Textbook on Red Cross Home Nursing. This volume belonged to Alice Otey Patton and some pages include handwritten notes on early signs of pregnancy. Nursing was at the core of the International Red Cross Movement at its beginning and Clara Barton, founder of the American Red Cross, first came to public attention as an amateur nurse who provided aid to soldiers during the Civil War. In addition to recruiting nurses to serve during war time, the American Red Cross also published Home Nursing Textbooks to educate and create a network of home nurses across the country. Alice Otey Patton (1886-1960) was a clubwoman and an important figure in Nashville and Franklin's early twentieth century African American community. Alice Otey Patton was involved with the Forget Me Not Club, a society club, and the World Fellowship of the YMCA. Born to Malinda Southall and Flem Otey in Williamson County on November 16, 1886, she later attended Walden University, a historically black college in Nashville. She married John Thomas Patton on December 15, 1915 and became involved in running the Patton Brothers Funeral Home, the oldest African-American funeral home in Middle Tennessee. She died on June 16, 1960 and is buried in Toussaint L'Ouverture Cemetery in Franklin, Tennessee.</abstract>
