  <abstract>Black and white photograph of Bishop M. F. L. Keith taken in June 1956. She wears white garments, a white headress, and is seated on a white linen covered chair. This may have been an ordination ceremony based on her white garments. June is when the General Assembly occurs and ordinations are conducted. It may also have been a healing service. Dr. Mary F. L. Keith (unknown -1962) succeeded Mother Mary Magdalena Lewis Tate as the second Chief Overseer of the House of God Church in 1931. She was an educator and philanthropist and under her administration the House of God Church greatly enhanced its social services and programs; expanded its real estate holdings; and increased membership. Under her direction, the church printed the First Universal Sunday School Lessons, and founded the Keith Bible Institute; the House of God Home for Children in East Chattanooga, Tennessee; and the House of God Home. She died on July 14, 1962 in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The House of God, Which is the Church of the Living God, the Pillar and Ground of the Truth Without Controversy, Inc. was founded by Mother Mary Magdalena Lewis Tate with the help of Bishop Keith, her secretary who would go on to be the second leader of the church after Mother Tate died. Mother Tate incorporated the church in 1908. After her death in 1930, the church split into three dominions, Jewell, Keith, and Lewis Dominions. The church took on the name House of God Church Keith Dominion at this point, named after Bishop Keith. It is headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee.</abstract>
