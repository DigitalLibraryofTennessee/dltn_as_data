  <abstract>Black and white photograph of Velma Lewis Lester, dressed in a uniform and bonnet seated and reading to a group of children. The picture was taken at Lewers Chapel C.M.E Church in Abbyville, Lafayette County, Mississippi. In the photograph she is reading in the church's kindergarten class. In the background are various educational aids. Velma Lewis Lester was from Lafayette County, Mississippi. Her father was born into slavery. The land for Lewers Chapel was donated by slave holders to the Black community after emancipation so that a church could be built. During the week, Lewers C.M.E. Church was used as a school and was one of the first Black schools in Lafayette County, Mississippi. Velma Lewis Lester was educated to the fourth grade at another church school, of which she was a member. Velma Lewis Lester continued to educate herself and was an avid reader. Lewers Chapel also served as a voter education and registration site for the Black community. Velma Lewis Lester was involved with getting the women of the church involved with voting and registering to vote.</abstract>
