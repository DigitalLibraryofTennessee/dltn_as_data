  <abstract>Black and white photograph of group including Lovelle Fouse Jenkins at a Christmas party during World War II. The attendees are arranged around a Christmas tree in three rows. Lovelle Fouse Jenkins is circled in the picture. She married Ernest Jenkins, a paratrooper with the 101st Airborne. Also identified is her sister Catherine Fouse, fifth person (moving left to right) on the third row. The Naval Support Activity at Mid-South is a naval base located in Millington, Tennessee. It first opened in 1917. Lovelle Fouse Jenkins was an awarded educator, pioneering black librarian, and church leader in Memphis, Tennessee. She served in the Shelby County school system for over 40 years, founded three separate libraries, and participated in the 1965 U.S. Office of Education study on the desegregation of schools in Tennessee. She was born in Haywood County, Tennessee on July 24, 1923. Her family moved to Memphis a year later, taking the L &amp; N Train. She attended Greenwood Elementary School, Booker T. Washington High School, and graduated from LeMoyne Owen, the only historically black college in Memphis. She died January 19, 2007.</abstract>
