  <abstract>A black and white photograph of 23 year old Gertrude Bridgeforth at the Memphis Fairgrounds. She is seated on a bench, with the sign "Memphis Fairgrounds" depicted in the background. The back of the photo identifies Gertrude Bridgeforth and includes an address and her date of birth. At about the time this photo was taken, she would drive her father, Frazier Guy, Sr., around the surrounding counties (Nesbet County) to register African Americans to vote. One church they would visit was Avery Church on Church Road. A white man named Bob from Chicago came down and stayed with her family. She remembers they hid him, and then Bob would help get African Americans registered. The Memphis Fairgrounds were in operation as a fairgrounds from 1912-2008, when the Mid-South fair moved to DeSoto County.</abstract>
