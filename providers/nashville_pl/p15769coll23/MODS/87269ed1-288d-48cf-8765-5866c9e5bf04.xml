  <abstract>A black and white photograph of Alice Otey Patton standing in front of the Patton Brothers Funeral Home in Franklin, Tennessee. She wears a long dark dress, with her hands behind her back. 'Alice Otey Patton' is handwritten on the back of the photograph. Patton Brothers Funeral Home is the oldest African-American funeral home in Middle Tennessee. Patton Brothers Funeral Home dates back to the days of horse drawn hearses and walking funeral processions. In 1882, at the age of 23, the late Reverend John Thomas (J. T.) Patton founded the business in his hometown of Franklin, Tennessee. Alice Otey Patton (1886-1960) was a clubwoman and an important figure in Nashville and Franklin's early twentieth century African American community. Alice Otey Patton was involved with the Forget Me Not Club, a society club, and the World Fellowship of the YMCA. Born to Malinda Southall and Flem Otey in Williamson County on November 16, 1886, she later attended Walden University, a historically black college in Nashville. She married John Thomas Patton on December 15, 1915 and became involved in running the Patton Brothers Funeral Home, the oldest African-American funeral home in Middle Tennessee. She died on June 16, 1960 and is buried in Toussaint L'Ouverture Cemetery in Franklin, Tennessee.</abstract>
