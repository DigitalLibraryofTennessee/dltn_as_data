  <abstract>Studio colorized photograph of Maggie Adams White. The photograph is framed and has suffered water damage. The photograph has been re-framed and is missing parts of the color around the woman's mouth. She wears a dark colored top and statement necklace. Part of the photograph appears to be stuck to the glass of the frame. Maggie Adams White (1882-1980) was a milliner and an active Republican in St. Louis, Missouri. She was born in South Carolina in 1882 to Young Adams, who was born into slavery. She went to St. James CME in Collierville, Tennessee and after moving to St. Louis, Missouri became a founding member of Scruggs CME. She was a member of the NAACP and entrenched in local politics. She died in December 1980.</abstract>
