  <abstract>Black and white postcard photograph of Thomas Dunbar Jarrett and Vernon Darice Jarrett as young boys. Thomas and Vernon are the sons of William Robert Jarrett and Annie Sybil Thomas Jarrett. Annie Sybil Thomas Jarrett (1881 - 1975) was a teacher and lifelong member of the Republican Party. She was born near Saulsbury, Tennessee. She is the daughter of Harriet and John Thomas Sr. She attended Clay Street School in Memphis, Tennessee, which later became the site of Booker T. Washington High School. She graduated with a degree in education from Lane College. She advocated in her community and schools for the teaching of African American history. According to family tradition, she urged family members to vote Republican to honor Abraham Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation. Vernon was born in Saulsbury, Tennessee. Annie Sybil Thomas Jarrett wanted her sons to be born in Saulsbury where she was from, so she had Vernon in Saulsbury and then went back home to Trenton, Tennessee.</abstract>
