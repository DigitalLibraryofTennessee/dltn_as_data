  <abstract>Black and white photograph of a man in a suit and tie from the chest up. The man is identified as Willis Jones, the grandfather of Mary Mitchell. He was a Steward and usher at Mt. Pisgah Chruch in Orange Mound, Tennessee. He was the revered patriarch of his family. His younger brother, Solomon Jones was the contemporary of Willis' oldest son. They would call him Uncle Witt because he was tougher than Witt leather. He passed away in December 1954. Mary Mitchell notes that he instilled a sense of trust in her. He would never let her drink his coffee when she was little because he said that it would make her skin black. (Mr. Willis' complexion is dark). Jones did work at Mt. Pisgah as a janitor. Like many church members he would help care for the church. Mary Mitchell and her siblings would help him on the weekends.</abstract>
