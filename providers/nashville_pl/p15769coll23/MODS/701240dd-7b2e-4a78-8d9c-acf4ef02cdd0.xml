  <abstract>Black and white photograph of Adeline Crozier standing on a front porch holding a hat and wearing a dress with a white apron. The photograph was taken in Oliver Springs, Tennessee in front of the Diggs House, home of a prominent white family in the area. The Diggs House was next to the Little Leaf Baptist Church, an African American church established in 1890. Adeline Crozier was a founding member of the church. She was born in 1845 into slavery. Family tradition believes her father was William (Bill) Staples, a slave owner, and her mother was enslaved but her name is unknown. Adeline Crozier had a son in 1861 named Jackson Crozier, nicknamed Jack, with Clark Crozier, Sr. a white man. She later married Henry Crozier, an African American man with the same last name, but no known relation to Clark Crozier. She had a second husband named Albert Peak. Their occupation is not certain, but they were likely farmers. Adeline Crozier died in 1926 in Oliver Springs.</abstract>
