  <abstract>Black and white photograph of Lucille Douglass seated at a window and reading a book. Lucille Douglass is posed in a manner linked to the New Negro Movement. This was an aesthetic movement that depicted middle-class people of color posed in a manner that would align with middle-class aspirations of respectability, education, and upward mobility. She is featured reading a book. Lucille Douglass was an educator and part of one of the founding families of East Trigg Baptist Church, a historic African American Baptist church in Memphis. According to family tradition, she had aspirations of being an educator despite the fact that she never went to college or obtained a formal education. She taught the bible school and spiritual development classes at East Trigg Baptist Church. She was married to Frank Douglass, a founding deacon of East Trigg Baptist Church, who is memorialized on a plaque on the original site of East Trigg Baptist Church.</abstract>
