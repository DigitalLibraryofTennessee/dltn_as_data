  <abstract>Black and white photograph of mostly children and adults posing for a group portrait inside of East Trigg Baptist Church. Inscribed on the photograph off to the right hand side are the names Herbert and Bobbie. East Trigg Baptist Church first opened in Memphis in 1902 and has had eight pastors, including Reverend William Herbert Brewster. Reverend Brewster was an influential and prolific Gospel music composer honored by the Smithsonian for his work. Frank and Lucille Douglass are also a founding family of the historic black church. Lucille Douglass was an educator and part of one of the founding families of East Trigg Baptist Church, a historic African American Baptist church in Memphis. According to family tradition, she had aspirations of being an educator despite the fact that she never went to college or obtained a formal education. She taught the bible school and spiritual development classes at East Trigg Baptist Church. She was married to Frank Douglass, a founding deacon of East Trigg Baptist Church, who is memorialized on a plaque on the original site of East Trigg Baptist Church.</abstract>
