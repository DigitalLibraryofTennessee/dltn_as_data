  <abstract>A book compiling various years of General Assembly meetings, as an annual report. The date on the cover is 1922-1923, but the booklet contains many reprints of minutes from 1920. The booklet was released to demonstrate financial transparency at a time when the Church was enduring financial difficulties. The work contains a message by Mother Mary Magdalena Lewis Tate called "Message of the Chief Overseer to the Grand General Assembly, St. Louis, Mo., 1920." This message is followed by the proceedings of various assemblies for 1920-1923, which include committee rosters, treasury reports, and minutes. From the cover: "Established over twenty years. The anniversary of the assemblies held with the Church and the last General Assembly held up to the time of compiling this book. The last General Assembly convened at St. Louis, Mo., Sept. 25th, 1920, according to the decree of our Church governing the General Assemblies, convening every three years under our new and revised decree, will hereafter convene once every year, perhaps in two sections, one north-east and one south-west. The next General Assembly will convene in 1923, at Washington, D. C., and in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The time of meeting will be announced by the Chief Overseer, board of the official organ of the Church, M. F. Lewis, J. F. Giles, A. H. White, D. L. O'Neal, E. C. Edwards, M. S. Ramey, N. McMillan, F. E. Lewis secretary-manager, M. L. Tate chairman and treasurer." The House of God, Which is the Church of the Living God, the Pillar and Ground of the Truth Without Controversy, Inc. was founded by Mother Mary Magdalena Lewis Tate with the help of Bishop Keith, her secretary who would go on to be the second leader of the church after Mother Tate died. Mother Tate incorporated the church in 1908. After her death in 1930, the church split into three dominions, Jewell, Keith, and Lewis Dominions. The church took on the name House of God Church Keith Dominion at this point, named after Bishop Keith. It is headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee. Mother Mary Magdalena Lewis Tate (1871-1930) was a traveling evangelist preacher and one of the first African American women to found a Pentecostal church and have women serve in leadership. She preached for her converts to "do right" and evangelized all over the country, with more than twenty charters for new state assemblies undertaken during her overseership. She was born in Vanleer, Tennessee on January 5, 1871, to Belfield Street and Nancy Hall Street. She married David Lewis at the age of nineteen and had two children, Walter Curtis and Felix Early Lewis. She divorced David Lewis, and around that time began traveling and preaching.</abstract>
