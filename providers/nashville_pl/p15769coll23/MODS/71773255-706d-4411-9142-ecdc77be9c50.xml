  <abstract>Black and white photograph of Annie Sybil Thomas Jarrett standing underneath the Tennessee Delegate sign at the Republican National Convention in Chicago. Based on the appearance of the delegation signs, it is believed to be the 1960 convention. She is wearing a floral dress, with a long pearl necklace. Jarrett was visiting family in Chicago and went to the convention, but she was a not delegate. Annie Sybill Thomas Jarrett (1881 - 1975) was a teacher and lifelong member of the Republican Party. She was born near Salisbury, Tennessee. She is the daughter of Harriet and John Thomas Sr. She attended Clay Street School in Memphis, Tennessee, which is now the site of the current Booker T. Washington High School. She graduated with a degree in education from Lane College. She advocated in her community and schools for the teaching of African American history. According to family tradition, she urged family members to vote Republican to honor Abraham Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation.</abstract>
