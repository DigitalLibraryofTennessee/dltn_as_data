  <abstract>A fifty-one page booklet written by Bishop Mary F. L. Keith. The full title is: "Shall Women Lead, Preach, Preside, Local and General Over the Flock of God? Volume II." It includes essays and arguments on the role of women in the Church and in the Bible. Bishop Keith wrote the book in response to a controversy over women presiding over religious bodies that was predominantly headed by men. Most of the bishops under her were men. The challenge came from other religious organizations who questioned why her male Bishops would follow a woman leader. The publication of this booklet inspired other women to enter the ministry and become leaders in the House of God church. Bishop Keith appears in a picture in the booklet wearing masculine clothing. Bishop Keith would often dress in a suit jacket and tie with a long skirt - whether from the pulpit or under graduation gowns. Some of the women leaders who served on her council began dressing that way, as well. Bishop Keith did this to make a point about her equality and standing with men. Dr. Mary F.L. Keith (unknown -1962) succeeded Mother Mary Magdalena Lewis Tate as the second Chief Overseer of the House of God Church in 1931. She was an educator and philanthropist and under her administration the House of God Church greatly enhanced its social services and programs; expanded its real estate holdings; and increased membership. Under her direction, the church printed the First Universal Sunday School Lessons, and founded the Keith Bible Institute; the House of God Home for Children in East Chattanooga, Tennessee; and the House of God Home. She died on July 14, 1962 in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The House of God, Which is the Church of the Living God, the Pillar and Ground of the Truth Without Controversy, Inc. was founded by Mother Mary Magdalena Lewis Tate with the help of Bishop Keith, her secretary who would go on to be the second leader of the church after Mother Tate died. Mother Tate incorporated the church in 1908. After her death in 1930, the church split into three dominions, Jewell, Keith, and Lewis Dominions. The church took on the name House of God Church Keith Dominion at this point, named after Bishop Keith. It is headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee.</abstract>
