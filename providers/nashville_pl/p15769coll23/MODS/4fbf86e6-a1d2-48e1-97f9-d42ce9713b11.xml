  <abstract>A black and white photograph of Alice Otey Patton standing on the steps in front of her home in North Nashville. This was her second home in Nashville, located across from Hadley Park on 28th Avenue. This area of Nashville is associated with Historic Jefferson Street. Nashville's middle and upper-class African Americans established this area as the center of the black community in Nashville, and it inlcudes three historically black univeristies and colleges. Alice Otey Patton (1886-1960) was a clubwoman and an important figure in Nashville and Franklin's early twentieth century African American community. Alice Otey Patton was involved with the Forget Me Not Club, a society club, and the World Fellowship of the YMCA. Born to Malinda Southall and Flem Otey in Williamson County on November 16, 1886, she later attended Walden University, a historically black college in Nashville. She married John Thomas Patton on December 15, 1915 and became involved in running the Patton Brothers Funeral Home, the oldest African-American funeral home in Middle Tennessee. She died on June 16, 1960 and is buried in Toussaint L'Ouverture Cemetery in Franklin, Tennessee.</abstract>
