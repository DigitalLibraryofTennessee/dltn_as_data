  <abstract>Color snap shot photograph of Reverend Montee Therese Falls dressed in white with flowers in the background. She was preparing for a wedding in the photo. Reverend Montee Therese Falls (1897-1980) was born in Osceola, Arkansas. She moved to Memphis to attend Booker T. Washington High School. Her father was white, and according to family lore, left his family behind to be with her mother. Her maternal grandmother, Augusta Norman, was born into slavery and later married an Irish man. She also received a bachelor's and a master's degree from Tennessee A &amp; I State University. Reverend Montee Therese Falls started the Unity Center of Memphis, now known as Unity Church of Memphis, Tennessee on October 20, 1952. She was inspired by radio broadcasts of the Unity Church of Christianity and called the white minister for more information. He was able to give her the materials, but the classes were going to be held at the Peabody Hotel, which was segregated at the time. The minister convinced her to go to the kitchen entrance and get the church services. Her church was originally located at an YMCA, then moved to a residential house at 1062 S Wellington, Memphis, Tennessee.</abstract>
