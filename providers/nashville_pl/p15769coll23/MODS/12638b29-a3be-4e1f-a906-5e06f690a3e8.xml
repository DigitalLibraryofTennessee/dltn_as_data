  <abstract>Black and white photograph of the Sunday School of East Trigg Baptist Church. Taken inside the church and arranged in four rows, the first row of students sit in the pew with the next row of adults sitting. The third row stands, and the fourth row appears to stand on the pews. There are both men and women, and young girls and young boys. Inscribed with ""East Trigg St. Baptist Church Rev. W.H. Brewster D.D. Pastor/ Sunday School Jan. 1935/ Memphis Tennessee."" East Trigg Baptist Church first opened in Memphis in 1902 and has had eight pastors, including Reverend Brewster. Reverend Brewster is one of the three founders of Gospel music and prolific writer of hymns, honored by the Smithsonian for his work. Frank and Lucille Douglass are also a founding family of the historic black church. Lucille Douglass was an educator and part of one of the founding families of East Trigg Baptist Church, a historic African American Baptist church in Memphis. According to family tradition, she had aspirations of being an educator despite the fact that she never went to college or obtained a formal education. She taught the bible school and spiritual development classes at East Trigg Baptist Church. She was married to Frank Douglass, a founding deacon of East Trigg Baptist Church, who is memorialized on a plaque on the original site of East Trigg Baptist Church.</abstract>
