  <abstract>Black and white photograph of Annie Sybil Thomas Jarrett from the waist up in front of a studio background. She wore a polka dot blouse. Annie Sybill Thomas Jarrett (1881 - 1975) was a teacher and lifelong member of the Republican Party. She was born near Saulsbury, Tennessee. She is the daughter of Harriet and John Thomas Sr. She attended Clay Street School in Memphis, Tennessee, which is the site of the current Booker T. Washington High School. She graduated with a degree in education from Lane College. She advocated in her community and schools for the teaching of African American history. According to family tradition, she urged family members to vote Republican to honor Abraham Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation. On the reverse of the photograph is the inscription, ""Made at Saulsbury [Tennessee] on Aug. 17, 1957 at a picnic."" According to descendants, photographers would come to community picnics and set up mobile studios to take pictures. She recounts many Fourth of July picnics in Grand Junction, Tennessee and the trains would have to add cars to get everyone to the picnic. There were often several photographers that would set up studios at the picnics.</abstract>
