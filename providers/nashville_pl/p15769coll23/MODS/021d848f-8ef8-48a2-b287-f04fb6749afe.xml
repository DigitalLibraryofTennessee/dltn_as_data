  <abstract>Black and white photograph of the Keith Dominion of the House of God Church congregation on the church lawn at the General Assembly of House of God in Chattanooga, Tennessee on June 15, 1938. They are loosely arranged in four large rows. The House of God split into three dominions after the passing of Mother Tate: the Lewis, Jewell, and Keith dominions. The Keith Dominion was led by Bishop M. F. L. Keith. The photograph is inscribed with "The General Assembly of The House of God Which is The Church of the Living God The Pillar And Ground of the Truth Without Controversy June 15, 1938 Chattanooga, Tenn." Dr. Mary F.L. Keith (unknown -1962) succeeded Mother Mary Magdalena Lewis Tate as the second Chief Overseer of the House of God Church in 1931. She was an educator and philanthropist and under her administration the House of God Church greatly enhanced its social services and programs; expanded its real estate holdings; and increased membership. Under her direction, the church printed the First Universal Sunday School Lessons, and founded the Keith Bible Institute; the House of God Home for Children in East Chattanooga, Tennessee; and the House of God Home. She died on July 14, 1962 in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The House of God, Which is the Church of the Living God, the Pillar and Ground of the Truth Without Controversy, Inc. was founded by Mother Mary Magdalena Lewis Tate with the help of Bishop Keith, her secretary who would go on to be the second leader of the church after Mother Tate died. Mother Tate incorporated the church in 1908. After her death in 1930, the church split into three dominions, Jewell, Keith, and Lewis Dominions. The church took on the name House of God Church Keith Dominion at this point, named after Bishop Keith. It is headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee.</abstract>
