<dc:description>Letterhead from the St. Louis Council of the National Council of Negro Women, Inc. Noted on the letterhead is "Affiliated with The National Council of Women of the United States and International Council of Women of the World." On the left hand side of the letterhead are the names of the organization's leadership. This letterhead is attributed to Maggie Adams White. Maggie Adams White (1882-1980) was a milliner and an active Republican in St. Louis, Missouri. She was born in South Carolina in 1882 to Young Adams, who was born into slavery. She went to St. James CME in Collierville, Tennessee and after moving to St. Louis, Missouri became a founding member of Scruggs CME. She was a member of the NAACP and entrenched in local politics. She died in December 1980.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Racial segregation barred African American women from white clubs. In response, African American women formed their own clubs. Some clubs were society clubs that offered social activities. Others were community clubs that focused on social causes, activism, and racial uplift work. Whether the club's main goal was to be a society club or an activism club, all clubs functioned as a place for African American women to organize. These sophisticated institutional networks amplified political activity by serving as mass communication systems between neighborhoods, cities, and states. The National Council of Negro Women was founded in 1935 by Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune, an influential educator and activist, with the mission to lead, empower and advocate for women of African descent, their families, and communities.</dc:description>
