<dc:title>Photograph of Reverend Montee Falls and Joseph Falls, Jr., circa 1970</dc:title>
<dc:description>Black and white photograph of Reverend Montee Falls and Joseph Falls, Jr. standing together outside. Reverend Montee Therese Falls (1897-1980)  was born in Osceola, Arkansas. She moved to Memphis to attend Booker T. Washington High School. Her father was white, and according to family lore, left his family behind to be with her mother. Her maternal grandmother, Augusta Norman, was born into slavery and later married an Irish man. She also received a bachelor's and a master's degree from Tennessee A &amp; I State University. Reverend Montee Therese Falls started the Unity Center of Memphis, now known as Unity Church of Memphis, Tennessee on October 20, 1952. She was inspired by radio broadcasts of the Unity Church of Christianity and called the white minister for more information. He was able to give her the materials, but the classes were going to be held at the Peabody Hotel, which was segregated at the time. The minister convinced her to go to the kitchen entrance and get the church services. Her church was originally located at a YMCA, then moved to a residential house at 1062 South Wellington, Memphis, Tennessee. Joseph Falls Jr, was Reverend Montee Falls' youngest son, he lived in Chicago, Illinois and was a chemist. </dc:description>
<dc:description>African Americans founded and built churches that served multiple civic and community functions. Churches were one of the few places African Americans could gather without the interference or suspicion of white people. Churches became the center of all religious, civic and community life. They provided spaces to educate and organize around social causes, including schools, daycare, voter registrations, veteran services, and racial justice. Because of their multi-purpose use, churches are at the center of African American political activity and served the secular needs of African Americans that were not equitably provided by federal, state and local authorities.
Churches were one of the few places that offered African American women leadership opportunities and gave them platforms to express their educational and political agendas. Because Churches also addressed the civic and secular needs of African Americans, women leaders in church often organized and worked on voter registrations, racial issues, education and healthcare, and other community needs. 
Portraiture was a highly political activity for African Americans, especially after Emancipation. Frederick Douglass considered photography the most democratic of arts and a crucial aid in African Americans' quest to achieve citizenship because it served as a potent equalizer. Early photographs of African Americans are linked to the first phase of a way of thinking defined as Racial Uplift: an ideology which emphasized education, achievement, and propriety as marks of personal distinction that would refute racist stereotypes and establish a basis for positive black identities. Photography became the way African Americans visually documented their efforts for full citizenship and political enfranchisement. </dc:description>
