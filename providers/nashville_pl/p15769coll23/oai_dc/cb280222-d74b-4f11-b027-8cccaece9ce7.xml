<dc:title>Jones-Mitchell family calendar, 1955</dc:title>
<dc:description>A family calendar for the month of December, 1955. The top of the calendar is a black and white copy photograph of a woman seated, with her hands resting on a book. Behind her stands a man with his hand resting on her shoulder. The woman is Mrs. Mary Adams Jones; she is the paternal grandmother of Mary Mitchell. The man standing behind Mary Adams Jones has been identified as either Will or Sam Adams (her brothers). Mary Adams Jones was likely educated at a church school. Mary Mitchell notes that Mary Adams Jones did not work outside of the home, and that she was always there after school cooking.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Portraiture was a highly political activity for African Americans, especially after Emancipation. Frederick Douglass considered photography the most democratic of arts and a crucial aid in African Americans' quest to achieve citizenship because it served as a potent equalizer. Early photographs of African Americans are linked to the first phase of a way of thinking defined as Racial Uplift: an ideology which emphasized education, achievement, and propriety as marks of personal distinction that would refute racist stereotypes and establish a basis for positive black identities. Photography became the way African Americans visually documented their efforts for full citizenship and political enfranchisement.</dc:description>
