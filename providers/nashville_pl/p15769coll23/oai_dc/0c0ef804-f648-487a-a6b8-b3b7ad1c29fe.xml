<dc:title>Photograph of Lucille Douglass with Church Group, circa 1950s</dc:title>
<dc:description>Black and white group photograph of women gathered for a Bible or missionary meeting at the home of Lucille Douglass, who is standing on the far left of the back row and is holding her bible in hand. Several other women in the photograph also hold bibles. Some women are wearing missionary uniforms. 
Lucille Douglass was an educator and part of one of the founding families of East Trigg Baptist Church, a historic African American Baptist church in Memphis. According to family tradition, she had aspirations of being an educator despite the fact that she never went to college or obtained a formal education. She taught the bible school and spiritual development classes at East Trigg Baptist Church. </dc:description>
<dc:description>Churches were one of the few places that offered African American women leadership opportunities and gave them platforms to express their educational and political agendas. Because Churches also addressed the civic and secular needs of African Americans, women leaders in church often organized and worked on voter registrations, racial issues, education and healthcare, and other community needs. 
Racial segregation barred African American women from white clubs. In response, African American women formed their own clubs. Some clubs were society clubs that offered social activities. Others were community clubs that focused on social causes, activism, and racial uplift work. Whether the club's main goal was to be a society club or an activism club, all clubs functioned as a place for African American women to organize. These sophisticated institutional networks amplified political activity by serving as mass communication systems between neighborhoods, cities, and states.</dc:description>
