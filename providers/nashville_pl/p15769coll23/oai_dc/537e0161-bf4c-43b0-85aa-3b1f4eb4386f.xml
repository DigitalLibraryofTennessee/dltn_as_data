<dc:title>Studio portrait of Eunice Harris Johnson, 1940s</dc:title>
<dc:description>Black and white copy of photograph of Eunice Harris Johnson seated before a garden backdrop. This photograph was taken at the Blue Light in Memphis, Tennessee. The Blue Light was a place where African American people could go to have their picture taken. Eunice Harris Johnson met her husband at Forest Hill CME Church in Forest Hill, Tennessee. Forest Hill was annexed into Collierville and no longer exists. She and her husband were registered voters and were Lincoln Republicans due to the prejudice of the Democrats in the south at the time.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Portraiture was a highly political activity for African Americans, especially after Emancipation. Frederick Douglass considered photography the most democratic of arts and a crucial aid in African Americans&#8217; quest to achieve citizenship because it served as a potent equalizer. Early photographs of African Americans are linked to the first phase of a way of thinking defined as Racial Uplift: an ideology which emphasized education, achievement, and propriety as marks of personal distinction that would refute racist stereotypes and establish a basis for positive black identities. Photography became the way African Americans visually documented their efforts for full citizenship and political enfranchisement. 
The first generations of African American voters after the passage of the 15th Amendment identified as Lincoln Republicans. This was the party associated with Emancipation and therefore the majority of African American voters voted along Republican lines up until the era of the Civil Rights Movement. There were still older African Americans, born at the beginning of the 20th century, who identified as Lincoln Republicans. Notable African American women Republicans during this time period include Mary Church Terrell and Ida B. Wells.</dc:description>
