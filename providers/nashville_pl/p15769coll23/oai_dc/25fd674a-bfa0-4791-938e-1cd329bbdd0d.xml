<dc:title>Photograph of Bishop Keith in front of Chattanooga Home, 1950s</dc:title>
<dc:description>A black and white photograph of Bishop Keith standing in front of a brick house with two young girls seated beside her. The three are in the far right corner of the photograph and wear dark colored clothing. This is likely the House of God Children's Home founded and operated by Bishop Keith outside Chattanooga. Children lived here in the dorms and attended school, based on grade, at either the Keith Bible Institute in Summit or Booker T. Washington High School. It later became an all girls' dorm with two girls to a room or as many as four per room. Time was very structured: students went to school during the day time, bible school four nights a week, Friday night church service, and Sunday school service. Parents were allowed to visit. 
Dr. Mary F. L. Keith (unknown -1962) succeeded Mother Mary Magdalena Lewis Tate as the second Chief Overseer of the House of God Church in 1931. She was an educator and philanthropist and under her administration the House of God Church greatly enhanced its social services and programs; expanded its real estate holdings; and increased membership. Under her direction, the church printed the First Universal Sunday School Lessons, and founded the Keith Bible Institute; the House of God Home for Children in East Chattanooga, Tennessee; and the House of God Home. She died on July 14, 1962 in Chattanooga, Tennessee.
The House of God, Which is the Church of the Living God, the Pillar and Ground of the Truth Without Controversy, Inc. was founded by Mother Mary Magdalena Lewis Tate with the help of Bishop Keith, her secretary who would go on to be the second leader of the church after Mother Tate died. Mother Tate incorporated the church in 1908. After her death in 1930, the church split into three dominions, Jewell, Keith, and Lewis Dominions. The church took on the name House of God Church Keith Dominion at this point, named after Bishop Keith. It is headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee. </dc:description>
<dc:description>Churches were one of the few places that offered African American women leadership opportunities and gave them platforms to express their educational and political agendas. Because Churches also addressed the civic and secular needs of African Americans, women leaders in church often organized and worked on voter registrations, racial issues, education and healthcare, and other community needs. Education was a key pillar of African American political activity, especially for women. In July 1920, the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs met in Tuskegee Alabama for their annual conference. At the convention a Resolution on Federal Suffrage was passed that established the political agenda for African American women as soon as they obtained suffrage with the 19th Amendment. The political platform included: building libraries, education, healthcare, preserving and documenting black history, temperance, anti-lynching laws, and enforcing the 14th and 15th Amendments.</dc:description>
