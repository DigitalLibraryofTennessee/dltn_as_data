<dc:title>Photograph of Willis Jones, circa 1940s</dc:title>
<dc:description>Black and white photograph of a man in a suit and tie from the chest up. The man is identified as Willis Jones, the grandfather of Mary Mitchell. He was a Steward and usher at Mt. Pisgah Chruch in Orange Mound, Tennessee. He was the revered patriarch of his family. His younger brother, Solomon Jones was the contemporary of Willis' oldest son. They would call him Uncle Witt because he was tougher than Witt leather. He passed away in December 1954. Mary Mitchell notes that he instilled a sense of trust in her. He would never let her drink his coffee when she was little because he said that it would make her skin black. (Mr. Willis' complexion is dark). Jones did work at Mt. Pisgah as a janitor. Like many church members he would help care for the church. Mary Mitchell and her siblings would help him on the weekends.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Portraiture was a highly political activity for African Americans, especially after Emancipation. Frederick Douglass considered photography the most democratic of arts and a crucial aid in African Americans' quest to achieve citizenship because it served as a potent equalizer. Early photographs of African Americans are linked to the first phase of a way of thinking defined as Racial Uplift: an ideology which emphasized education, achievement, and propriety as marks of personal distinction that would refute racist stereotypes and establish a basis for positive black identities. Photography became the way African Americans visually documented their efforts for full citizenship and political enfranchisement.</dc:description>
