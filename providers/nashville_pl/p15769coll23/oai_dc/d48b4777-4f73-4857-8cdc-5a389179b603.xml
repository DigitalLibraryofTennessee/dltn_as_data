<dc:title>Photograph of young adult man and young child, circa 1880s</dc:title>
<dc:description>A traditional black and white studio photograph in cabinet card style taken at Cottage Gallery in downtown Memphis. This is likely a rural African American family getting a professional photograph made. It depicts a young adult man dressed in a suit with his arm around a young girl. She is standing on a table in a dress. The Cottage Gallery was a Victorian era photography studio run by Charles Gebhardt, a German immigrant to Memphis. It operated from 1877-1906 at various locations. On the back of the cabinet card is the embossed description "Cottage Gallery: 49 and 51 Beale St. / Ladies Entrance: 2 and 4 Mulberry St. / Memphis Tenn. / Negatives Preserved." Handwritten above the embossing is the name "Salley Walker Oxley." It is not known if Salley Walker Oxley is one of the sitters or a relation to the sitters.</dc:description>
<dc:description>From the 1880s to the 1930s, African Americans flocked to photography studios to have portraits made as they chose to represent themselves. Portraiture was a highly political activity for African Americans, especially after Emancipation. Frederick Douglass considered photography the most democratic of arts and a crucial aid in African Americans' quest to achieve citizenship because it served as a potent equalizer. Early photographs of African Americans are linked to the first phase of a way of thinking defined as Racial Uplift: an ideology which emphasized education, achievement, and propriety as marks of personal distinction that would refute racist stereotypes and establish a basis for positive black identities. Photography became the way African Americans visually documented their efforts for full citizenship and political enfranchisement.</dc:description>
