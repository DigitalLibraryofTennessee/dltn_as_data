<dc:title>Photograph of Bishop Keith with General Assembly, 1961</dc:title>
<dc:description>A black and white photograph of Chief Overseer Bishop Keith with the bishops of the House of God 1961 General Assembly, at the House of God Church in Nashville, Tennessee. The Bishops are arranged in two loose rows, with five sitting in front and two standing on either side, and four standing in the back row. Sitting from right to left: Bishop Sally (S. A.) Fleeting (Connecticut), Bishop Keith (wearing graduation robes), Bishop Horace Avery (Ohio), Bishop James W. Jenkins, Bishop George Morgan (Connecticut); Standing left to right: Bishop W. H. Davis; Bishop Maurice Beard Sr., Bishop W. L. Nelson (South Carolina), Bishop Julius R. Lockley, Bishop P. J. (Philip Joseph) Fletcher, Bishop Henry Loyd Harrison. Inscribed on the lower left corner is "The House of God, etc. 1961 General Assembly, Bishop M.F.L. Keith, Chief Overseer." Bishop Keith passed away in 1962, shortly after this General Assembly. Bishop Keith would often dress in a suit jacket and tie with a long skirt, or in graduation gowns. Women leaders who served on her council began dressing that way, as well. Bishop Keith did this to make a point about her equality and standing with men. Dr. Mary F.L. Keith (unknown -1962) succeeded Mother Mary Magdalena Lewis Tate as the second Chief Overseer of the House of God Church in 1931. She was an educator and philanthropist and under her administration the House of God Church greatly enhanced its social services and programs; expanded its real estate holdings; and increased membership. Under her direction, the church printed the First Universal Sunday School Lessons, and founded the Keith Bible Institute; the House of God Home for Children in East Chattanooga, Tennessee; and the House of God Home. The House of God, Which is the Church of the Living God, the Pillar and Ground of the Truth Without Controversy, Inc. was founded by Mother Mary Magdalena Lewis Tate with the help of Bishop Keith, her secretary who would go on to be the second leader of the church after Mother Tate died. Mother Tate incorporated the church in 1908. After her death in 1930, the church split into three dominions, Jewell, Keith, and Lewis Dominions. The church took on the name House of God Church Keith Dominion at this point, named after Bishop Keith. It is headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee. </dc:description>
<dc:description>African Americans founded and built churches that served multiple civic and community functions. Churches were one of the few places African Americans could gather without the interference or suspicion of white people. Churches became the center of all religious, civic and community life. They provided spaces to educate and organize around social causes, including schools, daycare, voter registrations, veteran services, and racial justice. Because of their multi-purpose use, churches are at the center of African American political activity and serve the secular needs of African Americans that were not equitably provided by federal, state and local authorities.
Churches were one of the few places that offered African American women leadership opportunities and gave them platforms to express their educational and political agendas. Because Churches also addressed the civic and secular needs of African Americans, women leaders in church often organized and worked on voter registrations, racial issues, education and healthcare, and other community needs.</dc:description>
