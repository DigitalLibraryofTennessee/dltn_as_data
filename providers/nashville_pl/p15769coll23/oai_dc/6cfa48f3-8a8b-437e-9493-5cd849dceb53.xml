<dc:title>Photograph of Hattie Jane Combs Thomas, 1910s</dc:title>
<dc:description>Black and white photograph of Hattie Jane Combs Thomas, known as 'Aunt Harriett,' who was a midwife. She wears a dark colored top with a large white bow around her neck and brooch in the middle. Hattie Thomas died in November 1926 in Trenton, Tennessee. She is buried in the Bolivar Community Cemetery in Bolivar, Tennessee. Hattie Jane Combs Thomas was a biracial child. Her mother was Annie Combs who was an enslaved cook on the Ussery Plantation near Saulsbury, Tennessee. Her father was one of the white Ussery slaveowners. Annie Combs would take her daughter Hattie Jane Combs Thomas to work with her and she would play with her White cousins. According to family history, when the White Ussery children would receive their teaching lessons Hattie Jane Combs Thomas - their biracial cousin - would listen from another room and then receive lessons from her white cousins on how to read and write.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Portraiture was a highly political activity for African Americans, especially after Emancipation. Frederick Douglass considered photography the most democratic of arts and a crucial aid in African Americans' quest to achieve citizenship because it served as a potent equalizer. Early photographs of African Americans are linked to the first phase of a way of thinking defined as Racial Uplift: an ideology which emphasized education, achievement, and propriety as marks of personal distinction that would refute racist stereotypes and establish a basis for positive black identities. Photography became the way African Americans visually documented their efforts for full citizenship and political enfranchisement. </dc:description>
