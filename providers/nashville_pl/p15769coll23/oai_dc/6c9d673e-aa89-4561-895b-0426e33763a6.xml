<dc:title>Photograph Postcard of Alice Otey Patton with sisters, circa 1900</dc:title>
<dc:description>A black and white photograph postcard of Alice Otey Patton with her sisters. Pictured from left to right are Henrietta Hughes, Julia Hudson, Sallie Carthwright, and Alice Otey Patton. Postcards became a popular medium for commercial portraiture in the early 20th century. On the reverse of this portrait is a blank postcard to be used to write and mail a message. Alice Otey Patton (1886-1960) was a clubwoman and an important figure in Nashville and Franklin's early twentieth century African American community. Alice Otey Patton was involved with the Forget Me Not Club, a society club, and the World Fellowship of the YMCA. Born to Malinda Southall and Flem Otey in Williamson County on November 16, 1886, she later attended Walden University, a historically black college in Nashville. She married John Thomas Patton on December 15, 1915 and became involved in running the Patton Brothers Funeral Home, the oldest African-American funeral home in Middle Tennessee. She died on June 16, 1960 and is buried in Toussaint L'Ouverture Cemetery in Franklin, Tennessee.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Racial segregation barred African American women from white clubs. In response, African American women formed their own clubs. Some clubs were society clubs that offered social activities. Others were community clubs that focused on social causes, activism, and racial uplift work. Whether the club's main goal was to be a society club or an activism club, all clubs functioned as a place for African American women to organize. These sophisticated institutional networks amplified political activity by serving as mass communication systems between neighborhoods, cities, and states.</dc:description>
