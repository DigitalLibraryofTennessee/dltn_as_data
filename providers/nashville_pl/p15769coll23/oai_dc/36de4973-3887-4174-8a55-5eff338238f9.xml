<dc:title>Photograph of East Trigg St. Baptist Church Members, circa 1935</dc:title>
<dc:description>Black and white photograph of the members of East Trigg St. Baptist Church. Taken inside the church there are two rows of attendees, both men and women. East Trigg Baptist Church first opened in Memphis in 1902 and has had eight pastors, including Reverend William Herbert Brewster. Reverend Brewster was an influential and prolific composer of Gospel music honored by the Smithsonian for his work. Frank and Lucille Douglass are also a founding family of the historic black church. Lucille Douglass was an educator and part of one of the founding families of East Trigg Baptist Church, a historic African American Baptist church in Memphis. According to family tradition, she had aspirations of being an educator despite the fact that she never went to college or obtained a formal education. She taught the bible school and spiritual development classes at East Trigg Baptist Church. She was married to Frank Douglass, a founding deacon of East Trigg Baptist Church, who is memorialized on a plaque on the original site of East Trigg Baptist Church.</dc:description>
<dc:description>After emancipation, the first buildings African Americans built were churches that served multiple civic and community functions. Churches were one of the few places African Americans could gather without the interference or suspicion of white people. Churches became the center of all religious, civic, and secular life. They provided spaces to educate and organize around social causes, including schools, daycare, voter registrations, veteran services, and racial injustice. Because of its multi-purpose use, churches are at the intersection of African American political activity and serve the secular needs of African Americans that are not met by the U.S. Government in the public realm. Churches are also one of the few places that offered African American women leadership opportunities and gave them platforms to express their educational and political agendas. Because Churches also addressed the civic and secular needs of African Americans, women leaders in church often organized and worked on voter registrations, racial issues, education and healthcare, and other community needs.</dc:description>
