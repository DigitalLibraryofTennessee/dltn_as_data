<dc:title>Patton Brothers Funeral Home ledger book, 1912-1915</dc:title>
<dc:description>Ledger book containing accounts of the Patton Brothers Funeral Home in Franklin, Tennessee from 1912-1915. Patton Brothers Funeral Home is the oldest African-American funeral home in Middle Tennessee. Patton Brothers Funeral Home dates back to the days of horse drawn hearses and walking funeral processions. In 1882, at the age of 23, the late Reverend John Thomas (J. T.) Patton founded the business in his hometown of Franklin, Tennessee. Some notes in the account ledger indicate some customers were from the Spring Hill area. A partial index is included in the front of the ledger, although many names are difficult to read or do not use standardized spelling. Inside the front cover is what may be a possible outline of a typical funeral service, with references to singing and speeches. </dc:description>
