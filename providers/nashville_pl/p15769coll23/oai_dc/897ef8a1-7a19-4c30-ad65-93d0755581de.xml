<dc:title>Photograph of Annie Sybil Thomas Jarrett, between 1897 and 1906</dc:title>
<dc:description>Black and white studio photograph of Annie Sybil Thomas Jarrett standing in front of a studio background, depicting a richly decorated room. She wears a long dark colored skirt, light colored long sleeved blouse, and ornate hat. The photograph was taken by James P. Newton, the first black photographer in Memphis, whose works are very rare. Annie Sybill Thomas Jarrett (1881 - 1975) was a teacher and lifelong member of the Republican Party. She was born near Saulsbury, Tennessee. She is the daughter of Harriet and John Thomas Sr. She attended Clay Street School in Memphis, Tennessee, which is now the current site of the Booker T. Washington High School. She graduated with a degree in education from Lane College. She advocated in her community and schools for the teaching of African American history. According to family tradition, she urged family members to vote Republican to honor Abraham Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation. </dc:description>
<dc:description>The first generations of African American voters after the passage of the 15th Amendment identified as Lincoln Republicans. This was the party associated with Emancipation and therefore the majority of African American voters voted along Republican lines up until the era of the Civil Rights Movement. There were still older African Americans, born at the beginning of the 20th century, who identified as Lincoln Republicans. Notable African American women Republicans during this time period include Mary Church Terrell and Ida B. Wells. Portraiture was a highly political activity for African Americans, especially after Emancipation. 
Frederick Douglass considered photography the most democratic of arts and a crucial aid in African Americans' quest to achieve citizenship because it served as a potent equalizer. Early photographs of African Americans are linked to the first phase of a way of thinking defined as Racial Uplift: an ideology which emphasized education, achievement, and propriety as marks of personal distinction that would refute racist stereotypes and establish a basis for positive black identities. Photography became the way African Americans visually documented their efforts for full citizenship and political enfranchisement. </dc:description>
