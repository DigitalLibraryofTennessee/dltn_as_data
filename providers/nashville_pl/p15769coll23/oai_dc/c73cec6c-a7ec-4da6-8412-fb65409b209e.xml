<dc:title>Studio portrait of Reverend Herbert Johnson, circa 1940</dc:title>
<dc:description>Black and white copy photograph of Herbert Johnson. He stands in a suit with his hands at his side in front of a professional studio backdrop. Herbert Johnson was the brother of Everett Johnson, son of Dora Corinne Adams Johnson, and grandson of Samuel Adams. He was a reverend at Taylor's Chapel CME in Forest Hill, Tennessee and at Stinson CME in Rossville, Tennessee. He was a carpenter and jewelry maker. Johnson was held back in the first grade because he was too young to walk the long distances to school by himself. He grew up in Collierville, Tennessee and graduated from Manassas High School in Memphis, Tennessee, one of the first Black high schools in the city. He was killed by police officers during a domestic disturbance. This photograph may be a Hooks Brothers photograph. Hooks Brothers photography studio started in Memphis in 1907. It operated throughout most of the 20th century and was the second oldest African American business in Memphis.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Portraiture was a highly political activity for African Americans, especially after Emancipation. Frederick Douglass considered photography the most democratic of arts and a crucial aid in African Americans' quest to achieve citizenship because it served as a potent equalizer. Early photographs of African Americans are linked to the first phase of a way of thinking defined as Racial Uplift: an ideology which emphasized education, achievement, and propriety as marks of personal distinction that would refute racist stereotypes and establish a basis for positive black identities. Photography became the way African Americans visually documented their efforts for full citizenship and political enfranchisement.</dc:description>
