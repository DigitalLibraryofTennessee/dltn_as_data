<dc:title>Photograph of Annie Sybil Thomas Jarrett at Republican National Convention in Chicago, July, 1960</dc:title>
<dc:description>Black and white photograph of Annie Sybil Thomas Jarrett standing underneath the Tennessee Delegate sign at the Republican National Convention in Chicago. Based on the appearance of the delegation signs, it is believed to be the 1960 convention. She is wearing a floral dress, with a long pearl necklace. Jarrett was visiting family in Chicago and went to the convention, but she was a not delegate. Annie Sybill Thomas Jarrett (1881 - 1975) was a teacher and lifelong member of the Republican Party. She was born near Salisbury, Tennessee. She is the daughter of Harriet and John Thomas Sr. She attended Clay Street School in Memphis, Tennessee, which is now the site of the current Booker T. Washington High School. She graduated with a degree in education from Lane College. She advocated in her community and schools for the teaching of African American history. According to family tradition, she urged family members to vote Republican to honor Abraham Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation. </dc:description>
<dc:description>The first generations of African American voters after the passage of the 15th Amendment identified as Lincoln Republicans. This was the party associated with Emancipation and therefore the majority of African American voters voted along Republican lines up until the era of the Civil Rights Movement. There were still older African Americans, born at the beginning of the 20th century, who identified as Lincoln Republican. Notable African American women Republicans during this time period include Mary Church Terrell and Ida B. Wells.</dc:description>
