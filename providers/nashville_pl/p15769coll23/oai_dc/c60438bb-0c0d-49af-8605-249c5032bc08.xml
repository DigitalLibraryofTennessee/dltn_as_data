<dc:title>Photograph of Bishop Tate with Sisters, between 1910 and 1930</dc:title>
<dc:description>A black and white photograph of Mother Mary Magdalena Lewis Tate with members of her congregation surrounding her. Mother Mary Magdalena Lewis Tate (1871-1930) founded the House of God Which is the Church of the Living God the Pillar and Ground of the Truth Without Controversy in 1903, later incorporated in 1908. Mother Tate was a traveling evangelist preacher and one of the first African American women to found a Pentecostal church and have women serve in leadership. She preached for her converts to "do right" and evangelized all over the country, with more than twenty charters for new state assemblies undertaken during her overseership. She was born in Vanleer, Tennessee on January 5, 1871, to Belfield Street and Nancy Hall Street. She married David Lewis at the age of nineteen and had two children, Walter Curtis and Felix Early Lewis. She divorced David Lewis, and around that time began traveling and preaching.</dc:description>
<dc:description>African Americans founded and built churches that served multiple civic and community functions. Churches were one of the few places African Americans could gather without the interference or suspicion of white people. Churches became the center of all religious, civic and community life. They provided spaces to educate and organize around social causes, including schools, daycare, voter registrations, veteran services, and racial justice. Because of their multi-purpose use, churches are at the center of African American political activity and serve the secular needs of African Americans that were not equitably provided by federal, state and local authorities.
Churches were one of the few places that offered African American women leadership opportunities and gave them platforms to express their educational and political agendas. Because Churches also addressed the civic and secular needs of African Americans, women leaders in church often organized and worked on voter registrations, racial issues, education and healthcare, and other community needs.</dc:description>
