<dc:title>Photograph of Lucille Douglass, 1910s</dc:title>
<dc:description>Black and white photograph of Lucille Douglass seated at a window and reading a book. Lucille Douglass is posed in a manner linked to the New Negro Movement. This was an aesthetic movement that depicted middle-class people of color posed in a manner that would align with middle-class aspirations of respectability, education, and upward mobility. She is featured reading a book. Lucille Douglass was an educator and part of one of the founding families of East Trigg Baptist Church, a historic African American Baptist church in Memphis. According to family tradition, she had aspirations of being an educator despite the fact that she never went to college or obtained a formal education. She taught the bible school and spiritual development classes at East Trigg Baptist Church. She was married to Frank Douglass, a founding deacon of East Trigg Baptist Church, who is memorialized on a plaque on the original site of East Trigg Baptist Church.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Portraiture was a highly political activity for African Americans, especially after Emancipation. Frederick Douglass considered photography the most democratic of arts and a crucial aid in African Americans' quest to achieve citizenship because it served as a potent equalizer. Early photographs of African Americans are linked to the first phase of a way of thinking defined as Racial Uplift: an ideology which emphasized education, achievement, and propriety as marks of personal distinction that would refute racist stereotypes and establish a basis for positive Black identities. Photography became the way African Americans visually documented their efforts for full citizenship and political enfranchisement. 
Education was a key pillar of African American political activity, especially for women. In July 1920, the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs met in Tuskegee Alabama for their annual conference. At the convention a Resolution on Federal Suffrage was passed that established the political agenda for African American women as soon as they obtained suffrage with the 19th Amendment. The political platform included: building libraries, education, healthcare, preserving and documenting black history, temperance, anti-lynching laws, and enforcing the 14th and 15th Amendments.</dc:description>
