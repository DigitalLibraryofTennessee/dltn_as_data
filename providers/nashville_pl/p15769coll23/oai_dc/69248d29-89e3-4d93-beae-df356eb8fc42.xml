<dc:title>Photograph of Bishop Tate with Congregation, 1920s</dc:title>
<dc:description>A black and white photograph that might have been a general meeting of bishops and elders at House of God Church in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The church is located at 2021 Blackford Street, Chattanooga, Tennessee and still operates there today. Bishop Keith's house at the time of her death was across the street from this church. The group is loosely arranged into two lines, and also in two groups along the stairs. A smaller group is to the left of the stairs, and the larger to the right. The back of the photograph is inscribed with "Elder George Morgan, 1920s." A typewritten paper slip accompanies the photograph and identifies the sitters as: "FRONT ROW - SEATED (from left) Mother Tate, Bishop F E Lewis, Elder Robert Tate, Bishop W L Nelson, Elder Williams, Elder L R Bloomer, ? , Bishop Nelson's mother Elder Mary Nelson Woods, Elder S A Wells and Elder R B Amos BACK ROW - STANDING (from left) Bishop Keith, Bishop M S Ramey, Bishop E C Edwards, Bishop D L O'Neal, Bishop A H White, Bishop G F Giles, Bishop Jenkins, Elder J L Serceon, Bishop J R Lockley, Bishop G Morgan, Bishop L W Earley, Elder H W Cook, Elder Henry Ramey and Bishop B L McLeod." 
The House of God, Which is the Church of the Living God, the Pillar and Ground of the Truth Without Controversy, Inc. was founded by Mother Mary Magdalena Lewis Tate with the help of Bishop Keith, her secretary who would go on to be the second leader of the church after Mother Tate died. Mother Tate incorporated the church in 1908. After her death in 1930, the church split into three dominions, Jewell, Keith, and Lewis Dominions. The church took on the name House of God Church Keith Dominion at this point, named after Bishop Keith. It is headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee. Mother Mary Magdalena Lewis Tate (1871-1930) was a traveling evangelist preacher and one of the first African American women to found a Pentecostal church and have women serve in leadership. She preached for her converts to "do right" and evangelized all over the country, with more than twenty charters for new state assemblies undertaken during her overseership. She was born in Vanleer, Tennessee on January 5, 1871, to Belfield Street and Nancy Hall Street. She married David Lewis at the age of nineteen and had two children, Walter Curtis and Felix Early Lewis. She divorced David Lewis, and around that time began traveling and preaching.</dc:description>
<dc:description>African Americans founded and built churches that served multiple civic and community functions. Churches were one of the few places African Americans could gather without the interference or suspicion of white people. Churches became the center of all religious, civic and community life. They provided spaces to educate and organize around social causes, including schools, daycare, voter registrations, veteran services, and racial justice. Because of their multi-purpose use, churches are at the center of African American political activity and serve the secular needs of African Americans that were not equitably provided by federal, state and local authorities.</dc:description>
