<dc:title>Photograph of Lovelle Fouse Jenkins and Eighth Grade class at Greenwood Elementary School/Greenwood Church, 1937</dc:title>
<dc:description>Black and white photograph of the eighth grade graduating class of Greenwood Elementary School. The children are on the outside of the building, lined up in five rows with the girls in the middle and boys on the outside. The girls are all wearing light colored dresses. Lovelle Fouse Jenkins is circled on the photograph. Greenwood Elementary School was located at Greenwood CME Church. This school eventually became Hamilton High School located in South Memphis. Greenwood CME is the second oldest CME church in Memphis, the school and church operated out of the same building for the early history of the church. It was organized in 1872, and continues to operate on Kimball Avenue. Lovelle Fouse Jenkins was an awarded educator, pioneering black librarian, and church leader in Memphis, Tennessee. She served in the Shelby County school system for over 40 years, founded three separate libraries, and participated in the 1965 U.S. Office of Education study on the desegregation of schools in Tennessee. She was born in Haywood County, Tennessee on July 24, 1923. Her family moved to Memphis a year later, taking the L &amp; N Train. She attended Greenwood Elementary School, Booker T. Washington High School, and graduated from LeMoyne Owen, the only historically black college in Memphis. She died January 19, 2007. </dc:description>
<dc:description>Librarians and educators were key pillars of African American political activity, especially women. In July 1920, the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs met in Tuskegee Alabama for their annual conference. At the convention a Resolution on Federal Suffrage was passed that established the political agenda for African American women as soon as they obtained suffrage with the 19th Amendment. The political platform included: building libraries, education, healthcare, preserving and documenting black history, temperance, anti-lynching laws, and enforcing the 14th and 15th Amendments. Early African American schools were often established within historic black churches. After emancipation, the first buildings African Americans built were churches that served multiple civic and community functions. Churches were one of the few places African Americans could gather without the interference or suspicion of white people. Churches became the center of all religious, civic, and secular life. They provided spaces to educate and organize around social causes, including schools, daycare, voter registrations, veteran services, and racial injustice. Because of its multi-purpose use, churches are at the intersection of African American political activity and serve the secular needs of African Americans that are not met by the U.S. Government in the public realm. </dc:description>
