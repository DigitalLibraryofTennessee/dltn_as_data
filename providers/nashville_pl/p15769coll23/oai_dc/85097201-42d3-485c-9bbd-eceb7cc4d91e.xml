<dc:title>Photograph Postcard of Melinda Southall, between 1900 and 1942</dc:title>
<dc:description>A black and white photograph postcard of Melinda Southall sometime after 1900. She wears a highnecked blouse with a brooch. In the background is a white fence, and the photograph is an oval shape.  Melinda Southall (1853-1942) was the daughter of Fannie Hugh Southall and mother to Alice Otey Patton. She was born into slavery at Carter Plantation. She married Flem Otey on June 18, 1872. 
Postcards became a popular medium for commercial portraiture in the early 20th century. On the reverse of this portrait is a blank postcard to be used to write and mail a message. 
Alice Otey Patton (1886-1960) was a clubwoman and an important figure in Nashville's and Franklin's early twentieth century African American community. Alice Otey Patton was involved with the Forget Me Not Club, a society club, and the World Fellowship of the YMCA. Born to Malinda Southall and Flem Otey in Williamson County on November 16, 1886, she later attended Walden University, a historically black college in Nashville. She married John Thomas Patton on December 15, 1915 and became involved in running the Patton Brothers Funeral Home, the oldest African-American funeral home in Middle Tennessee. She died on June 16, 1960 and is buried in Toussaint L'Ouverture Cemetery in Franklin, Tennessee.</dc:description>
<dc:description>Portraiture was a highly political activity for African Americans, especially after Emancipation. Frederick Douglass considered photography the most democratic of arts and a crucial aid in African Americans' quest to achieve citizenship because it served as a potent equalizer. Early photographs of African Americans are linked to the first phase of a way of thinking defined as Racial Uplift: an ideology which emphasized education, achievement, and propriety as marks of personal distinction that would refute racist stereotypes and establish a basis for positive black identities. Photography became the way African Americans visually documented their efforts for full citizenship and political enfranchisement.</dc:description>
