<dc:title>Photograph of Lucille Douglass at East Trigg Baptist Church, 1930s</dc:title>
<dc:description>Black and white photograph of Lucille Douglass with two other women standing in front of the choir pit at East Trigg Baptist Church. Lucille Douglass is on the far right of the photograph. Lucille Douglass was an educator and part of one of the founding families of East Trigg Baptist Church, a historic African American Baptist church in Memphis. According to family tradition, she had aspirations of being an educator despite the fact that she never went to college or obtained a formal education. She taught the bible school and spiritual development classes at East Trigg Baptist Church. She was married to Frank Douglass, a founding deacon of East Trigg Baptist Church, who is memorialized on a plaque on the original site of East Trigg Baptist Church. East Trigg Baptist Church first opened in Memphis in 1902 and has had eight pastors, including Reverend Brewster. Reverend Brewster is a well-known composer of Gospel music and prolific writer of hymns, honored by the Smithsonian for his work.</dc:description>
<dc:description>African Americans founded and built churches that served multiple civic and community functions. Churches were one of the few places African Americans could gather without the interference or suspicion of white people. Churches became the center of all religious, civic and community life. They provided spaces to educate and organize around social causes, including schools, daycare, voter registrations, veteran services, and racial justice. Because of their multi-purpose use, churches are at the center of African American political activity and serve the secular needs of African Americans that were not equitably provided by federal, state and local authorities.
Churches are also one of the few places that offered African American women leadership opportunities and gave them platforms to express their educational and political agendas. Because Churches also addressed the civic and secular needs of African Americans, women leaders in church often organized and worked on voter registrations, racial issues, education and healthcare, and other community needs.</dc:description>
