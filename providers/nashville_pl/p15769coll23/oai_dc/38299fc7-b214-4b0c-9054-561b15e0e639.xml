<dc:title>Photograph of African American Clubwomen including Lucille Douglass, 1940s</dc:title>
<dc:description>Group photograph of Lucille Douglass and other African American clubwomen, taken at the home of Lucille Douglass who is seated on the far right hand of the table. The group is posed together with some women seated at a table and others stand behind and beside the seated women. The table is set with several place settings. 

Lucille Douglass was an educator and part of one of the founding families of East Trigg Baptist Church, a historic African American Baptist church in Memphis. According to family tradition, she had aspirations of being an educator despite the fact that she never went to college or obtained a formal education. She taught the bible school and spiritual development classes at East Trigg Baptist Church. </dc:description>
<dc:description>African Americans founded and built churches that served multiple civic and community functions. Churches were one of the few places African Americans could gather without the interference or suspicion of white people. Churches became the center of all religious, civic and community life. They provided spaces to educate and organize around social causes, including schools, daycare, voter registrations, veteran services, and racial justice. Because of their multi-purpose use, churches are at the center of African American political activity and serve the secular needs of African Americans that were not equitably provided by federal, state and local authorities.

Education was also a key pillar of African American political activity, especially for women. In July 1920, the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs met in Tuskegee Alabama for their annual conference. At the convention a Resolution on Federal Suffrage was passed that established the political agenda for African American women as soon as they obtained suffrage with the 19th Amendment. The political platform included: building libraries, education, healthcare, preserving and documenting black history, temperance, anti-lynching laws, and enforcing the 14th and 15th Amendments. 

Racial segregation barred African American women from white clubs. In response, African American women formed their own clubs. Some clubs were society clubs that offered social activities. Others were community clubs that focused on social causes, activism, and racial uplift work. Whether the club's main goal was to be a society club or an activism club, all clubs functioned as a place for African American women to organize. These sophisticated institutional networks amplified political activity by serving as mass communication systems between neighborhoods, cities, and states.</dc:description>
