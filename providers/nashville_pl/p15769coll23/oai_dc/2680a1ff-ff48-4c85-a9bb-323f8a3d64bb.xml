<dc:title>Photograph of Annie Sybil Thomas Jarrett, 1957 August 17</dc:title>
<dc:description>Black and white photograph of Annie Sybil Thomas Jarrett from the waist up in front of a studio background. She wore a polka dot blouse. Annie Sybill Thomas Jarrett (1881 - 1975) was a teacher and lifelong member of the Republican Party. She was born near Saulsbury, Tennessee. She is the daughter of Harriet and John Thomas Sr. She attended Clay Street School in Memphis, Tennessee, which is the site of the current Booker T. Washington High School. She graduated with a degree in education from Lane College. She advocated in her community and schools for the teaching of African American history. According to family tradition, she urged family members to vote Republican to honor Abraham Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation. On the reverse of the photograph is the inscription, ""Made at Saulsbury [Tennessee] on Aug. 17, 1957 at a picnic."" According to descendants, photographers would come to community picnics and set up mobile studios to take pictures. She recounts many Fourth of July picnics in Grand Junction, Tennessee and the trains would have to add cars to get everyone to the picnic. There were often several photographers that would set up studios at the picnics.</dc:description>
<dc:description>The first generations of African American voters after the passage of the 15th Amendment identified as Lincoln Republicans. This was the party associated with Emancipation and therefore the majority of African American voters voted along Rebublican lines up until the era of the Civil Rights Movement. There were still older African Americans, born at the beginning of the 20th century, who identified as Lincoln Republicans. Notable African American women republicans during this time period include Mary Church Terrell and Ida B. Wells.</dc:description>
