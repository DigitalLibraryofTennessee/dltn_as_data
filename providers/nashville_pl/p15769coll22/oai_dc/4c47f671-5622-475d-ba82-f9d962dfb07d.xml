<dc:description>Detailed architectural and historical survey of the building spanning the addresses of 144 Second Avenue North and 146 Second Avenue North, also known as the Pilcher Building. Items consist of photographs and documents created from around 1976 to 1994. Black and white photographs are of the exterior front or street view of the building, with some views from an angle to the side, sometimes showing adjacent buildings. Some photographs show upper portions of the building. Some photographs may also show storefronts, signs, pedestrians, vehicles, and street scenes. Documents contain architectural descriptions, compilations of deed and city directory research, notes from an interview with Henry Z. Lipscomb, Jr. and other research notes. This building was built in 1902. It is made of brick and is four stories tall. The first story facade has been remodeled, but some elements of the original structure remain. Forms part of Historic Nashville Inc. Downtown Survey, Series I. Downtown Survey.</dc:description>
