<dc:description>Detailed architectural and historical survey of the building spanning the addresses of 138 Second Avenue North, 140 Second Avenue North, and 142 Second Avenue North. Items consist of photographs and documents created from around 1976 to 1994. Black and white photographs are of the exterior front or street view of the building, with some views from an angle to the side, often showing adjacent buildings. Some photographs show upper portions of the building or architectural details. Some photographs may also show storefronts, signs, pedestrians, vehicles, and street scenes. Documents contain architectural descriptions, compilations of deed and city directory research, and other research notes. This building was built around 1895. It is made of brick and is five stories tall. This structure has long housed the hardware firm of H. G. Lipscomb and Co.; in 1980 it was the longest-operating business in the same location on Second Avenue. Forms part of Historic Nashville Inc. Downtown Survey, Series I.
