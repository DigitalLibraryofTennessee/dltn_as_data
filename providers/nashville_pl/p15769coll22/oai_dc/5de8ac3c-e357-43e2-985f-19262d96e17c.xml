<dc:description>Detailed architectural and historical survey of the building located at the northwest corner of Church Street and First Avenue North. Address appears variously in documents as 100 Church Street and 108 First Avenue North. Items consist of a photograph and documents created around 1980. One black and white photograph shows both the south and east facades of the building.  Documents contain architectural descriptions, and brief compilations of deed and city directory research. This building was built around 1895. It is made of brick, is six stories tall, and was associated for many years with the Phillips &amp; Buttorff Manufacturing Co. It was torn down sometime between 1980 and 2007, possibly as a result of a nearby fire in 1985. Forms part of Historic Nashville Inc. Downtown Survey, Series I. Downtown Survey.</dc:description>
