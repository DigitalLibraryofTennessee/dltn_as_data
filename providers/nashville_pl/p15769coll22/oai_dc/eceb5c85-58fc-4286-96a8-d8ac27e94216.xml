<dc:description>Detailed architectural and historical survey of the building located at 201 Second Avenue North, consisting of photographs and documents created from 1977 to 1994. Black and white photographs are of the exterior front or street view of the building, as well as a portion of the side of the building next to Church Street. The front of the adjoining building at 203 Second Avenue North is also visible. Some photographs may also show storefronts, signs, pedestrians, vehicles, and street scenes. Documents contain architectural descriptions, compilations of deed and city directory research, and other research notes. This building was built around 1885. It is made of brick and is three stories tall, and has numerous distinctive architectural details. Unlike many of the facades on the west side of Second Avenue, this building's facade avoided the demolition that occurred when the street was widened. Noted Tennessee distiller George A. Dickel had his business here for many years, from 1869 to 1917, when the property was sold by his surviving business partner, V. E. Shwab, owner of the Silver Dollar Saloon. Candy businesses also have a history at this site, including the Roberts Candy Co. in the early 1900s, and the Bradley-Mack Candy Co. Manufacturing in the 1970s.  Forms part of Historic Nashville Inc. Downtown Survey, Series I. Downtown Survey.</dc:description>
