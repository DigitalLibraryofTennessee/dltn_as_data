<dc:title>Linda Shanks, CBC's First Female Graduate</dc:title>
<dc:subject>Students; Women</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Of the initial forty women to be admitted to CBC, Shanks was the first to graduate, as well as being CBC's first female scholarship recipient. 

In addition to gender diversity, she also brought ecumenical diversity, being a Baptist. She and her husband had moved to Memphis, and wanting to complete her college education, she appreciated that CBC would allow her to transfer her credits in Baptist theology. While she knew she was one of the first woman admitted, she did not realize she would be the first to receive a degree. </dc:description>
