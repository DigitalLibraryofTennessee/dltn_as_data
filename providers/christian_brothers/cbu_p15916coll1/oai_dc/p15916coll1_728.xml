<dc:subject>Schools</dc:subject>
<dc:description>A nine-page account of the early history of  Christian Brothers College, from the preliminary work undertaken by the Memphis committee to bring Catholic education to the city in 1871 until approximately 1914. 

The "Committee of Citizens," local Catholic leaders enthusiastic over the possibility of a Brothers' school, selected the Memphis Female Academy's building as the site. As the property carred debt, Brother Maurelian was hesitant to commit to Memphis, but the Brother Superior in St. Louis encouraged him, and CBC was founded.</dc:description>
