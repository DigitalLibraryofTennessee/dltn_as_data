<dc:title>Notes on the New Building</dc:title>
<dc:subject>Buildings; Educational Facilities</dc:subject>
<dc:description>When planning the new Christian Brothers College Building for East Parkway, it was noted that: a three story building was all right if there would be an elevator (Unfortunately, there were three floors but no elevator when the building was completed); two bathtubs with flanged edges were needed; there should be independent single light switches in addition to the main corridor lights; toilet and bathroom doors should come within two inches of the floor; the cook stove should be in the center of the kitchen, facing the water supply; provision should be made for roller paper in the restrooms, not box paper; and a cellar under the storeroom would be nice to have as a cool place to store vegetables.</dc:description>
