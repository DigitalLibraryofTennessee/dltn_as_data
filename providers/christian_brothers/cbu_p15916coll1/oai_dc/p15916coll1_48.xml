<dc:subject>Buildings; Educational facilities; Barry Hall (Administration Building)</dc:subject>
<dc:description>The Administration Building was named and dedicated to the memory of Edward F. Barry in 1985. It has stood on Christian Brothers' East Parkway Campus since 1950. 

The Administration Building received the name Barry Hall at the instigation of Abe Plough; offered to donate $100,000 to an 1984 fund-raising campaign if CBC would so honor Barry, who was a lifelong friend of his, in addition to being a long time supporter of the college.</dc:description>
