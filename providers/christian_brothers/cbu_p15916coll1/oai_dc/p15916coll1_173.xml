<dc:subject>Religious education; Barry Hall (Administration Building)</dc:subject>
<dc:description>President Brother Theodore Drahmann delivered this homily  at the dedication of the Brother Miguel Faculty Courtyard behind Barry Hall. 

About Brother Miguel, he said: "I am convinced that his premier qualities of teacher - scholar - saint very simply but completely epitomize the ideal of the Christian Brother as educator - likewise the ideal of all the men and women who have joined the Brothers in our mission here at CBC - especially those who serve as faculty members."</dc:description>
