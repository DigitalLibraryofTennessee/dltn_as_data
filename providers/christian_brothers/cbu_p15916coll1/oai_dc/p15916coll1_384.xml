<dc:description>Christian Brothers Junior College performed George Seaton's play "But Not Goodbye," at the Pink Palace Little Theater on December 13 &amp; 14, 1949. 

The Pink Palace was the intended home of Clarence Saunders, founder of the Piggly Wiggly grocery store, the first self-service grocery. Saunders never lived there, however, due to misfortune with the New York Stock Exchange. The creditors donated the building to the City of Memphis for use as a museum. The Little Theater was located in the east wing of the Pink Palace, where a never-used indoor swimming pool had been planned.</dc:description>
