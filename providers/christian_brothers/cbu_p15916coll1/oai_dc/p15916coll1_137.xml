<dc:title>Christian Brothers High School Band</dc:title>
<dc:subject>Bands; Boys; Musical instruments</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Christian Brothers College assembled a band from its earliest days. The thirty students who were taking music lessons formed a 21-person band and a 24-person orchestra. 

The band quickly established itself at Memphis parades and events; one such was the dedication of the fountain in Court Square (commemorated in the inscription on the rim of the fountain).

The first director was Professor Paul Schneider, a professional musician. </dc:description>
