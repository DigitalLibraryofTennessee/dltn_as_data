<dc:subject>Kenrick Hall; Names; Educational facilities; De La Salle Christian Brothers</dc:subject>
<dc:description>This Christian Brothers College Public Relations press release from 1965 told of the Kenrick Brothers--Brother Luke Joseph and Brother Joseph Matthew--who were actual brothers, and for whom the former high school building was renamed. Brother Luke Joseph was superior when the Brothers acquired the East Parkway property, during the fund drive, and when the move took place. Brother Joseph Matthew taught at CBC for 25 years and was the first principal of the Parkway school. </dc:description>
