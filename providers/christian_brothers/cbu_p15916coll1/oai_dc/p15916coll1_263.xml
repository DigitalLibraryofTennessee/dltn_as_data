<dc:title>Freshmen Initiation</dc:title>
<dc:subject>Students; Hats; Hazing</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Upper classmen required incoming freshmen to wear red derbies as a sign of their being at the bottom of the ranks at Christian Brothers College. 

Derby-wearing was a form a hazing. According to Henry Pellegrin, student president in 1957, it was inspired by the derbies sported by many of the characters in Walt Kelly's comic strip, "Pogo." The designation, "worms" for Freshmen also came from "Pogo," though none of the worm-character in the comic strip were among the derby-wearers.

Freshmen were required to wear the derbies at all times until Halloween unless they could beat the Sophomores in a touch football game in mid-October.</dc:description>
