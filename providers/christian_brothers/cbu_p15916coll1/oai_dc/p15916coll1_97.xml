<dc:title>Freshmen (A.K.A. "Worms") on the Rock</dc:title>
<dc:subject>Rocks; Students; Hats; Hazing</dc:subject>
<dc:description>From the late 1950s until the early 70s, freshman initiation at Christian Brothers College found new students being called "worms" and wearing red derbies to set them apart from upperclassmen. 

During the initiation period, upperclassmen could dictate that the freshmen clean rooms, polish shoes, or sit on rocks "till they're warm." Initiation came to an end with the "Worm Game," an intramural football game that pit the freshmen against the sophomores.
