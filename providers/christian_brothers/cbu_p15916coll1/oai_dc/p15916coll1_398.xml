<dc:description>Siena College was the Catholic women's college in Memphis, and as such was treated as a sister school by Christian Brothers College.

This panel program was organized by the Student Government Association of Siena, for a discussion regarding "friendship, dating, recreation, and grooming." The panel consisted of two Siena students and two Christian Brothers students, and was presided over by a local priest.   </dc:description>
