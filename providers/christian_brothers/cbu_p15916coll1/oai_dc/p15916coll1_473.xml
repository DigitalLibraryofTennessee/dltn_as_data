<dc:title>Christian Brothers College Prospectus, 1871</dc:title>
<dc:subject>Educational facilities</dc:subject>
<dc:description>In this, the first recruiting announcement for Christian Brothers College, Brother Maurelian detailed the costs and requirements for prospective students. Payment was invariably in advance. Tuition, board, washing, and a doctor's fee was $165.00 for five months. Students deposited $25.00 for books. No "objectionable" books could be kept, and all students were required to bring  a "mosquito bar."
