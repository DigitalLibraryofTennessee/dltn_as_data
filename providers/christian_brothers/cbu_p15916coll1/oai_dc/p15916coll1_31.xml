<dc:title>Aerial Photo of Christian Brothers College,  from the West, early 1950s</dc:title>
<dc:subject>Aerial photographs; Educational facilities; Aerial views; Railroads</dc:subject>
<dc:description>The High School building, the Administration Building, the De La Salle Gymnasium, and Battersby Hall were the major buildings visible at the time of this photo. The buldings Next to the Gym were the Barracks: one of which housed faculty and staff; the other, students. 

Behind the High School building were the auxiliary buildings, which provided supplemental space for high school and junior college activities, such as the band and a woodshop. The White House can still be seen in a stand of trees between the Administration Building and the Gym. Also visible was the Union Railway, which at this time, cut across the south side of campus.</dc:description>
