<dc:subject>Radio stations</dc:subject>
<dc:description>WCBC-FM was a radio station operated by CBC students and faculty from 1966-1969. It had been preceded by WCBC-AM, which broadcast from Maurelian Hall, only operating within the college's own electrical system. In 1965, Henry Slavick of WMC offered CBC a radio transmitter, a donation that was finalized the following year. The FCC approved WCBC-FM on September 13, 1966.</dc:description>
