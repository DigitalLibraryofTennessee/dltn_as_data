<dc:subject>Bridges; Dedications; De La Salle Christian Brothers</dc:subject>
<dc:description>The Christian Brothers Bridge was officially dedicated, in honor of the Christian Brothers who served at Christian Brothers College and University, with special recognition of Brother Francisco Martin.

The plaque on the bridge reads: "In honor of the past, present, and future De La Salle Christian Brothers in Memphis, Tennessee, who since 1871 have ministered to the needs of Memphis youth by remembering the presence of God, educating minds, and touching hearts. The Lasallian tradition fostered by their benevolence has begotten immeasurable service to others in our city and across the world. 'Education is all a matter of building bridges,' --Ralph Ellilson."</dc:description>
