<dc:title>Christian Brothers College catalog, 1945-1955</dc:title>
<dc:subject>Universities &amp; colleges</dc:subject>
<dc:description>The catalog sets out the course of study for CBC during its period as a two-year junior college post-WWII.  Information on accreditation and tuition is also included.

The GI Bill encouraged many former soldiers to apply. Historically, CBC had limited in-coming classes to 50, but the many applications and the pressure to provide schooling for veterans led to the admission of 72 in 1946.

There were two-year programs of study in business, chemistry, the liberal arts, pre-law, pre-med, pre-dentistry, pre-pharmacy, pre-engineering, and secretarial. </dc:description>
