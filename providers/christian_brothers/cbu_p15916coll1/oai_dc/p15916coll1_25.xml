<dc:description>Freshmen (note the Derbies) clean the Rock as part of their orientation.

The Rock was uncovered at the CBHS construction site and moved to the College's campus during the 1961-62 school year as a curiosity. 

It has had several locations over the years. For some time, it was located in front of Kenrick, but the sounds from Freshman/Sophomore "rioting" over the painting of the Rock ("Rock Night," according to alum Gregory Charles Krog) disturbed classes in the Evening program (and people whose houses abutted the campus). After spending some time north of Rozier in the 1990s, it was eventually moved to its present location near the Thomas Center.

Eventually, the Rock morphed into a point of campus conversation. In the late sixties, it was the focal point for social-issue demonstrations. It has been decorated and painted over many times through the years.</dc:description>
