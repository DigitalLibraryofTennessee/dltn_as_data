<dc:description>The Treasure Chest Players staged "Life With Father" at the Pink Palace theater in Chickasaw Gardens in April 1951. "Life With Father" was one of the four plays that led to the establishment of the "Buccaneers" as the name for Christian Brothers' students and athletes. 

Note that there's a pirate flag adorning the front of the program.

Inspired by the earlier productions of "H.M.S. Pinafore" and "The Pirates of Penzance," the players included the model of a pirate ship as a prop in each of the plays ("Life with Father," "Seven Keys to Baldpate," "But Not Good-Bye," and "The Bishop Misbehaves"). In addition, students had taken to carrying a pirate flag around campus and proclaiming themselves the "Parkway Pirates."  By 1951, the drama club assumed the name of Treasure Chest Players, the campus newspaper had been renamed the Buccaneer, the yearbook was named the Galleon, the the Parkway Pirates had morphed into the Buccaneers.</dc:description>
