<dc:subject>Homecomings; Pirates; Floats (Parades)</dc:subject>
<dc:description>The Engineers Club of CBC, with the assistance of other student clubs (Mechanical Engineers, IEEE, and American Chemical Society built this giant version of Bucky the Buccaneer to intimidate the homecoming rivals, Southern Mississippi University, in 1965. Here he towered above the auditorium. 

The Big Buccaneer's designer was Earl Gillespie, graduating senior in mechanical engineering and basketball star. Construction of all parts were done at his home on Chickasaw Road. Co-chairmen for the display were Jim McCoy and Tom Linder. Representatives of the other clubs were: Gregory Athas, IEEE; Earl Gillespie, ME; Bart Freihaut, ACS. The Big Buccaneer was made of wood, chicken wire, and 30,000 pieces of wax paper. 

CBC won the game, 80 to 76.</dc:description>
