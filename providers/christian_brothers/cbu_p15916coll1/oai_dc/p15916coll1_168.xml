<dc:title>CBC Family Night Raffle: Bulletin #1</dc:title>
<dc:subject>Fund raising; Gymnasiums</dc:subject>
<dc:description>"Who Wants to Stand for a Whole Basketball Game?! Not C.B.C. Boys! (and floors are mighty hard seats!)." The Mothers' Club and the student body organized a raffle to raise money to pay for seats in the new gymnasium. Top prize was a new Chevy. In addition, a school holiday was promised for the whole school if 750 seats were secured.

Over 2500 roll-away seats were eventually acquired, seating capacity that made the CBC gym the largest high school gymnasium at the time in Memphis.</dc:description>
