<dc:description>In 1949, the Christian Brothers College Choral Club--assisted by players from St. Agnes, Holy Names, and St. Thomas--put on two performances of Gilbert and Sullivan's "Pirates of Penzance," with a "cast of 140." These performances were key moments leading to the establishment of Bucky the Buccaneer as the school's mascot; within a few years after "Pirates" was staged, CBC would be awash in all things piratical: Bucky as the mascot, the Buccaneers as the name for the athletic teams (and the student body at large), and the Galleon yearbook.</dc:description>
