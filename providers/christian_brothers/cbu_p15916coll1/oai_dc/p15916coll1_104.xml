<dc:title>Lockers in Kenrick Hall</dc:title>
<dc:subject>Educational facilities; Interiors; Kenrick Hall</dc:subject>
<dc:description>The original CBC building on the East Parkway campus was a high school and remained so until CBHS moved to its location on Walnut Grove road in 1965. 

The high school building was then reconfigured for the college. As Kenrick Hall, it provided 14 faculty offices, 3 new laboratories, and 12 classrooms. 

The lockers remained in place, until the demolition of the building.</dc:description>
