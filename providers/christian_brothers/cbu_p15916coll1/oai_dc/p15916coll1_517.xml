<dc:subject>Computers</dc:subject>
<dc:description>In 1963, CBC upgraded to the IBM 1620 Model II. At the time, it was the only Model II in the Memphis area, and CBC was one of the first colleges in the nation to receive it. Said to be at least four times faster than the Model I, it could multiply, make logical decisions, and transmit data. Area companies could rent time for using the computer.</dc:description>
