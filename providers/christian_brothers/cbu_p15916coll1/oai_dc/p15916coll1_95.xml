<dc:subject>Bands; Musicians; Students</dc:subject>
<dc:description>The CBC Band was directed by Captain Charles C. Harrison in the 1930s.

In 1931, the Band was revived and Captain Harrison was engaged to be the director. The Knights of Columbus loaned the band 24 instruments and thereafter quickly became a fixture in Memphis' parades, recognized as one of the best bands in town. In 1933, it was selected to be the official Cotton Carnival Band.</dc:description>
