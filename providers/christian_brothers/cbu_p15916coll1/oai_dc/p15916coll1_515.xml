<dc:title>Ground Breaking for Christian Brothers High School on Walnut Grove</dc:title>
<dc:subject>Ground breaking ceremonies; De La Salle Christian Brothers</dc:subject>
<dc:description>The growth of Christian Brothers College (and High School) at its East Parkway location became such that the physical plants of the college and high school needed to be separated. To that end, the Brothers purchased 28 acres near the intersection of Walnut Grove Road and the Expressway (now I-240) for a completely new high school. 

It was rainy and muddy at the ground breaking for the CBHS in 1964. Bishop Durick of Nashville wielded the shovel. Others seen the picture were (L-R): Brother J. Stephen, Brother Terence McLaughlin, Reverend Joseph Wesley, Brother J. Alfred, Lawrence Guidi, and Edward Barry.</dc:description>
