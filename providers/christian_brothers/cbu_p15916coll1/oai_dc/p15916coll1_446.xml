<dc:title>Memphis Christian Brothers Junior College presents "The Bishop Misbehaves"</dc:title>

<dc:description>Christian Brothers Junior College staged a production of "The Bishop Misbehaves" on April 19th and 20th, 1950 in the theater at the Memphis Pink Palace Museum.  

"The Bishop Misbehaves" was one of the "pirate ship" plays that contributed to CBC's identification with the Buccaneer as its mascot and athletic name. 

After the grand production of "Pirates of Penzance," a small pirate ship appeared as part of the stage set for four plays staged by CBC in 1949 and 1950: "The Bishop Misbehaves," "Life with Father," "But Not Good-Bye," and "Seven Keys to Baldpate." When the pirate ship was not in use for a play, it would be paraded around campus to the declaration: "Here we are, the Parkway Pirates."

By 1951, all things piratical became the order of the day: the theatrical troupe became the Treasure Chest Players, the athletes' and student body nickname became the Buccaneers, and the yearbook would become know as the Galleon.</dc:description>
