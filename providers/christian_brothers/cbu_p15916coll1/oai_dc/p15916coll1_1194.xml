<dc:description>Gilbert &amp; Sullivan's H.M.S. Pinafore was the first extravaganza performance staged by CBC and St. Agnes Academy. There were two performances at Memphis' Ellis Auditorium, downtown, on February 8, 1948 with a cast of 75. 1948 was the 75th anniversary of Christian Brothers College and the 100th anniversary of the arrival of the De La Salle Brothers in America. Pinafore's success led to the production the next year of Pirates of Penzance, which itself inspired the college's pirate-themed mascot and sports name: Bucky, the Buccaneers, as well as the Galleon Yearbook, and  later, the Cannon student newspaper.</dc:description>
