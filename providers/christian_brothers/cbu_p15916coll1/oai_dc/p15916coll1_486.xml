<dc:description>The IBM 160 Model I only had 16K of memory. It was comprised of a desk-sized central processing unit, a card reader, punch units, an electronic card sorter, two printing card punches, and an accounting machine that could print 264,000 characters in an hour.

Student interest was high, and the computer center was regularly in use until 11 and 12 at night.</dc:description>
