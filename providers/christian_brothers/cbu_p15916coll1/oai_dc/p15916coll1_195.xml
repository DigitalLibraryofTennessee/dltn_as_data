<dc:title>WCBC Programming Guide, 1968</dc:title>
<dc:subject>Radio broadcasting; Radio stations;</dc:subject>
<dc:description>A ditto copy of the WCBC FM programming guide of 1968.  Provides a sample lineup of the daily offerings of CBC's onetime radio station--featuring lots of classical music, along with news, current events, and religious broadcasting.

The program guides were first distributed in the fall term of 1968 with the following staff: Program Director, Edwina Carruth; Student Manager, Ed Raniszewski; Production Engineer, Paul Leary; Chief Engineer, John Marino; Assistant Chief Engineer, Bos Yonker.

Staff members were:  Nick Baldassano, Ed Colacouri, Francis Herron, Tom Jecha, Tom Ostrander, Charles Paulk, and Bill Thompson. 

Actual broadcasts began in October 1968, but because of television interference, operations were discontinued on November 5, 1968. After much consideration, CBC requested the cancellation of the license in November 1969.</dc:description>
