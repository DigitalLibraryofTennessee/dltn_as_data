<dc:title>Frosh versus Sophs</dc:title>
<dc:subject>Students; Hazing; Hats</dc:subject>
<dc:description>The end of "worming," the time during which Freshmen were required to wear derbies, culminated in a touch football game between the Freshmen and the Sophomores. A Sophomore win meant that the Freshmen had to continue wearing derbies for an additional two weeks. Paul Buscemi (in the derby) was the Freshman captain; Harrigan Wortsmith captained the Sophomores. They are accompanied by Ellen McGuire, a student from Siena College. The Freshmen lost 30-6.</dc:description>
