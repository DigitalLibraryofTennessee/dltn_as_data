<dc:description>Siena College, a Catholic college for women, was established in Memphis in 1922 by the Dominican Sisters under the name of St. Agnes College. It was the first Catholic women's college in the tri-state area. Originally, the institution included primary and secondary students, but in 1939 the lower grades moved to a separate location, taking the St. Agnes name, while the college changed its name to Siena. Siena College was a sister school to Christian Brothers College, providing cheerleaders for the CBC teams. Both CBC and Siena shared many activities--dances, lectures, and performances. In 1947, Siena moved from its original location at Vance and Orleans to a site in East Memphis, on Poplar between Cherry Road and Perkins.  Siena closed in 1972. </dc:description>
