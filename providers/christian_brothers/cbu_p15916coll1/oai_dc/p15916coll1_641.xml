<dc:description>While issue 2 of the CBC News focused on feats of strength, issue 3 concentrated on academics. It describes its four curricula--some career-oriented, and others preparing for college admission. It also details the "remedial summer program" for eighth and ninth graders, designed to ensure new high school students are prepared for the rigors of a Christian Brothers education, regardless of where they attended elementary and middle school.</dc:description>
