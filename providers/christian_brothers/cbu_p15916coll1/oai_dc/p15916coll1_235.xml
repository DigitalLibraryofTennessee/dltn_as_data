<dc:title>Overpass on East Parkway</dc:title>
<dc:subject>Roads; Bridges; Streets</dc:subject>
<dc:description>The overpass on East Parkway, with its low clearance, had been the cause of 40+plus years' worth of trapped trucks. In 1946, plans began for the removal of the overpass. Politics delayed the start of the work until 1951, however, and it took two years to complete. 

In conjunction with the work, East Parkway would be widened and generally improved from Union to Young. Among the improvements were a turn lane, a left-turn only light, and eliminating a open drain that ran in the dividing island on Parkway. In addition to the overpass, the Union Railroad bridge that crossed East Parkway at Central was also be removed at this time. </dc:description>
