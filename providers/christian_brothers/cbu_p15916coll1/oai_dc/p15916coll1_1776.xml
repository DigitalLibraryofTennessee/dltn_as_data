<dc:title>C.B.C., Memphis, Tennessee: The Junior College Department</dc:title>
<dc:subject>Students; Soldiers; War</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Where were they? This paper listed the locations of as many former students of the Christian Brothers Junior College as could be found in 1942-1943. 

While some were still civilians many could be found preparing for war in such situations as finishing a course in aircraft armament in Denver, the barracks on Chanute Field in Illinois, at C-meteorology school seeking a commission, at bombadier school in California, waiting to be shipped out, at the Army Air base in Pratt, Kansas, at the Naval Research Lab in Washington, DC.

In 1942 the Junior College had begun teaching courses in pre-meteorology and radio coding to prepare students for military service. 

In 1943 the Junior College suspended operations for the duration of the War.</dc:description>
