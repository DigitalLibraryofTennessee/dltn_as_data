<dc:title>Christian Brothers College - St. Agnes Academy Building Fund Letter</dc:title>
<dc:subject>Correspondence; Fund raising</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Building fund chairmen, Leslie M. Stratton, Edward F. Barry, and Edward Orgill, encouraged attendance at the opening dinner of the building campaign for Christian Brothers College and St. Agnes Academy.

The fund would build an Administration building for CBC, living quarters for the Brothers, and a new school building "on Union Extended" for St. Agnes. (The St. Agnes building was eventually built on Walnut Grove Road.)

Ed Barry (after whom the Administration building was eventually renamed) spoke, describing the campaign and giving reasons for expanding each school. </dc:description>
