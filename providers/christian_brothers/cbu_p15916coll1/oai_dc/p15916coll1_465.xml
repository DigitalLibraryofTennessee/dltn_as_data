<dc:description>With the Adams Street location increasingly hemmed in by the congestion of downtown Memphis, it was determined to move Christian Brothers College eastward where it was situated near the intersection of East Parkway South and Central. 

The cornerstone of the new 3-story building was laid on June 9, 1939. The dedication of the cornerstone of the new Christian Brothers College facility on East Parkway took place on June 9, 1939. 

This building was long known as the High School building and later named Kenrick Hall.</dc:description>
