<dc:title>Dedication of the Brother Lambert Thomas Courtyard</dc:title>
<dc:subject>Dedications; De La Salle Christian Brothers; Flag bearers; Students; Rocks</dc:subject>
<dc:description>In the foreground, Brother Philip Matthews and Brother Pablo unveiled the placque and the rock as the Chairman of CBC's Board of Trustees, Lance Forsdick, looked on. Three flag-bearing students stood in the background: (L-R) Sharon Kehoe (Papal flag), Goffrey Hardaway (Tennessee flag), Aldo Javier Ruiz (Shelby County flag).

The rock was found while the Christian Brothers High School site on Walnut Grove was being excavated, and Brother Lambert Thomas had it transferred to the East Parkway campus in 1962.</dc:description>
