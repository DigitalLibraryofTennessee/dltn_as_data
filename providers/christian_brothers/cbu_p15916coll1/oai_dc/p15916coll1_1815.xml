<dc:description>Bicensation 75 was performed for Christian Brothers College's Parents Weekend in November 1975. Inspired by CBC being named the first Bicentennial Campus in Tennessee in advance of the nation's 200th birthday celebration, it was scripted by Sister Patricia Buckley. The show was staged in the Thomas Center, with over 100 students participating. The cast included student and faculty performing groups: the Bicensations, the Concert Chorus, the Faculty Five (Plus Three), the Community Chorus '75, the Southwinds, the Skip-tp-my-Lou Dancers, and the Moving Picture Ball cast.</dc:description>
