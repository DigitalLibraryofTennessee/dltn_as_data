<dc:title>CBC's "Secret" Tunnel: Excerpt from Blueprint</dc:title>
<dc:subject>Blueprints; Educational facilities; Buildings; Construction; Tunnels</dc:subject>
<dc:description>The first two buildings constructed on the Christian Brothers College's East Parkway campus were the High School Building and the Boiler House, later known as Kenrick and Battersby Halls respectively. As the name suggests, the Boiler House provided heat and water to the High School; the Brothers also lived on its second floor. The pipes ran through a tunnel connecting the two structures, and in cold weather, the Brothers used this tunnel to traverse the campus. When Kenrick was demolished to make way for the Rosa Deal School of Arts, the tunnel--now with no place to go--was blocked at its northern end. </dc:description>
