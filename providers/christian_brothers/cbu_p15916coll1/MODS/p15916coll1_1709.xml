  <abstract>The Founders Circle was established in 1977 in honor of Brother Maurelian and the Brothers of the De La Salle Christian Schools who founded CBC in 1871. Membership was open to faculty, staff, friends, alumni, and corporations; "dues" were based on cash gifts of $1 for each year of the school's history.</abstract>
