  <abstract>Christian Brothers College ended its degree programs with the 1915 graduation. Leo Joseph Pettis, Eugene Lipsky, and Harry Bernstein received degrees. College programs did not resume until 1940, when a Junior College opened briefly, closing because of World War II. College level programs were needed after the War, and Christian Brothers College joined the High School on the campus at 650 East Parkway South.</abstract>
