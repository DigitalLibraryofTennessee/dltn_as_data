  <abstract>Nicknamed "the Fort" because of its shape, Battersby Hall was the second building on Christian Brothers College's East Parkway campus. The school's power plant, it also served as the Brothers Residence. Twelve residence hall rooms were on the second floor. The legendary Brothers' underground tunnel ran between the Fort and the High School Building (Kenrick). When the Brothers moved to residences in the Administration Building in 1950, the living quarters in the Fort were repurposed to house 22 students. It later held the offices for the engineering faculty. In 1989, the fort received an official name, in honor of and dedicated to the memory of Brother Clair Battersby.</abstract>
