  <abstract>The New Catholic High School and College for Boys was the first structure built on Christian Brothers' East Memphis property. It was later renamed Kenrick Hall in honor of Brother Luke Joseph Kenrick, CBC president from 1922-1928 and 1935-1941, and his sibling Brother Joseph Matthew Kenrick, CBHS principal from 1939-1941. The brothers were president and principal of Christian Brothers College at the closing of its 612 Adams Street location and at the opening of the new school at 650 East Parkway.</abstract>
