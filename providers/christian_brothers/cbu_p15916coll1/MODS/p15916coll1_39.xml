  <abstract>Buckman Hall was an expansion of the earlier Ave Maria Hall on Christian Brothers University's campus. The Architects were Askew, Nixon, Ferguson, and Wolfe, Inc. Grinder Brothers were the general contractors. The architects drew on the American Collegiate style of Kenrick and Barry in designing Buckman Hall. A special feature of Buckman was the installation of sound-proof windows to block the traffic noise from East Parkway.</abstract>
