  <abstract>The "Blast the Rebs" homecoming float was created by Christian Brothers College's Engineer's Club. The rocket, with a Belmont Rebel clinging to it, had a revolving nose cone. It won first place in the competition, although, alas, Belmont won the game, 88-86, with a come-from-behind score. Belmont used the name Rebels until 1995.</abstract>
