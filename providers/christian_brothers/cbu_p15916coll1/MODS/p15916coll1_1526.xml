  <abstract>It had been 70 degrees the night before; by the next morning the temperature had dropped into the 20s and 30s. The great Ice Storm of 1994 covered the campus, East Parkway, and all of Memphis in two inches of ice. Christian Brothers was without power for about a week due to power surges that blew up the campus transformers. All classes were cancelled for the duration.</abstract>
