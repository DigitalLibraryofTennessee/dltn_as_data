  <abstract>The reception and installation of "The Essence of Mertie," was announced. The three-thousand pound marble sculpture was installed in Buckman Hall, and named in honor of Mrs. Mertie W. Buckman. The artist was Jill Burkee, of New York, of Italian marble--as the press release puts it, "the same quarry and marble used by Michelangelo." The press release explained the symbolism of the work, and how the subject, art, artist, and the University came together as a whole.</abstract>
