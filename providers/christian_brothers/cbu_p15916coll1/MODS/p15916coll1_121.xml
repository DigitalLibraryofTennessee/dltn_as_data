  <abstract>"Pirates of Penzance" was an extravaganza production with a cast of 140 staged by the Christian Brothers College Choral Club, with assistance from St. Agnes Academy, Holy Names High School, and St. Thomas High School. Performed at Ellis Auditorium in February 1948, it was the inspiration for the eventual adoption of the Buccaneer as the school's mascot, and the nickname, "Bucs," for the sports teams.</abstract>
