  <abstract>Brother Luke Joseph Kenrick led Christian Brothers College, first as Director, from 1922-1928, and again as President from 1935-1941. He began teaching at CBC in the late 1890s; over the years, he taught literature, philosophy, history, public speaking, and astronomy. In 1940, he oversaw the school's move from Adams Street to East Parkway. The High School building that was erected at the new location in 1940 would eventually bear the name Kenrick Hall in honor of Brother Luke Joseph and his sibling, Brother Joseph Matthew, who was the High School's first principal.</abstract>
