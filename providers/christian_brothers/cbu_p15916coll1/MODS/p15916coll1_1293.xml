  <abstract>In the early 1960s, Elvis Presley would drop by Christian Brothers College to take part in the occasional touch football game. According to Brother Louis Althaus, he came to campus frequently at the time. Elvis posed with CBC students at one of the games in 1962. According to a Bell Tower article, two students who were there, Jack Casagrande and Frank Wapole, tried to identify the people in the photograph: (L-R) unknown, Tom Stoegbauer, Bill Schroh (?), Norman Kolb, Don O'Connor, Frank Wapole, Stan Bobowski, Elvis Presley, Dante Jaeger (?), George Whitworth, Jack Casagrande, Steve Merck, Ken Chuckro, Don Bezub, Bernie Rauen (kneeling, right), and George Durbin (squatting, center)</abstract>
