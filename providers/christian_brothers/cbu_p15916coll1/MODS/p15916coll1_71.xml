  <abstract>Designed by A.L. Aydelott and Associates, St. Joseph Hall was originally a classroom building, with laboratories as well as a large lecture hall. It was designed to serve for the electrical engineering and mechanical labs, as well as chemistry and physics. Much of the equipment used to furnish these labs was acquired from the Fournier Institute of Illinois. Work on the building began in July 1954. It was ready for use by the fall of 1955. It was first occupied in 1955. Since then, it has been refitted for computer labs and office space.</abstract>
