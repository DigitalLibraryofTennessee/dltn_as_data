  <abstract>Brother Hyacinth Richard Gerlach (President 1947-1953) takes the shovel at the groundbreaking for Maria (later Ave Maria) Hall. He is accompanied by Father Francis Ringwald of Blessed Sacrament, Msgr. M.F. Kearning of Immaculate Conception, and Father Francis, the chaplain of CBC. Ave Maria Hall was a three-story classroom/office building. Offices, including the Registrar, were on the first floor. The second and third floors had five classrooms each. Ave Maria Hall was eventually replaced by Buckman Hall.</abstract>
