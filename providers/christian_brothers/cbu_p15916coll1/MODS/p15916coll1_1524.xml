  <abstract>Christian Brothers College was designated the first Bicentennial Campus in Tennessee for the 200th birthday of the American Revolution. This inspired the musical extravaganza, "Bicensation," performed in the Thomas Center by a cast of 100+ students for Parents Weekend, November 14-16, 1975. The set, built by Engineering students and Brother Felix Bland, was modeled on a showboat; the scenes were painted by Brother Chuck Gregor of the Scholasticate. The script was written by Humanities student, Sister Patricia Buckley. Three performances were held in the Thomas Center over the course of the weekend.</abstract>
