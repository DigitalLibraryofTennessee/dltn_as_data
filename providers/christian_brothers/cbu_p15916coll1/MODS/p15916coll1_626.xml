  <abstract>The inaugural issue of "Sweet Thursday," an anonymous publication by and for Christian Brothers College students, showed the students' views of the Vietnam War and the draft, the school's and the Catholic Church's attitude towards war generally, and CBC student apathy (a survey of support for "Down With Apathy;" 1% for, 1% against, and 98% No Opinion). According to Marty Rice, one of the original staff members, the publication took its name from an earlier student paper (no copies known to exist) and was inspired by John Steinbeck's sole venture into humor. Early issues were distributed in the middle of the night in each of the major buildings on campus.</abstract>
