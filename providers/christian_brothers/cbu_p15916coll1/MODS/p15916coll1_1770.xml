  <abstract>After the move to the new East Parkway campus, Christian Brothers College reopened its Junior College in 1940. College courses had ceased in 1914, leaving only the High School. (An elementary school program ran until 1921.) The Junior College closed again in 1943, because the majority of the student body joined the military to serve in the second World War.</abstract>
