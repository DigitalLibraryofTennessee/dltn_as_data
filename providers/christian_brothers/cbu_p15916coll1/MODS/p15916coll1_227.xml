  <abstract>The invitations to the dedication of the Nolan Engineering Center were in the form of mini-blueprints, showing the new building in relation to the Thomas Center, Library, the equally new Buckman Quad, and the Tennis Courts (later replaced by faculty/staff parking). To draw attention to them, the invitations were sent in mailing tubes instead of envelopes.</abstract>
