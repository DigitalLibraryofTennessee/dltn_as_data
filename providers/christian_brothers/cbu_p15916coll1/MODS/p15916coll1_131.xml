  <abstract>Brother Maurelian Sheel founded Christian Brothers College in 1871. He served as President multiple times, in 1871-1891, 1894-1899, and again in 1904-1909. During his time, Christian Brothers College served as a combined elementary school, high school, and college that granted diplomas, bachelor's, and master's degrees. He came to Memphis from the Pass Christian College on the Gulf Coast of Mississippi in the wake of the Yellow Fever and its closing of that school. Because of his knowledge of the Yellow Fever (he had caught and recovered from in 1867), Brother Maurelian took action to close CBC during the 1878 outbreak in Memphis, move the Brothers to the outskirts of town to avoid exposure, and request federal involvement (eventually writing President Rutherford B. Hayes directly) in the search for the cause and prevention of the disease.</abstract>
