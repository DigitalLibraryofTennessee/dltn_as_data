  <abstract>This information page about the draft and deferment was distributed to CBC students during the Korean War: eligible draftees aged 20 and 19 1/2 had to be inducted before younger men. Once a student had commenced his college courses in the fall, he could not be drafted until the following June--so long as he made passing grades. Other methods of obtaining a deferment were also described.</abstract>
