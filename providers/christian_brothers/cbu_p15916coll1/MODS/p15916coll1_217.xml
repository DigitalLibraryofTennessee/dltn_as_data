  <abstract>Elementary students hold a Christian Brothers College pennant in the early 1900s. The school functioned as a combined elementary school, high school, and college from its founding in 1871 until 1915, when college classes ceased. Elementary education ended in 1922, leaving only the high school to continue until 1940, when a junior college opened.</abstract>
