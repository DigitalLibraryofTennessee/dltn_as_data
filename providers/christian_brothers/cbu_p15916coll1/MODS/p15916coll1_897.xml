  <abstract>A granite sign stood on the corner of Christian Brothers College campus at the intersection of Central and East Parkway. Nearly fifteen feet tall, it was to be moved to the South Entrance on Central after the wrought iron fencing was put up. However, it crumbled to pieces in the process.</abstract>
