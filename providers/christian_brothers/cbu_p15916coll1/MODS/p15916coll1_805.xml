  <abstract>The first issue of the first student paper, the Junior Collegian, appeared in December 1940. It was typeset by the students and printed on a portable press owned by a student named Preston Englert. It aspired to "be a paper for the students, by the students, and of the students . . . We are anxious to have the full cooperation of the student body in furnishing news and helping to write it. If therre are occasional errors, well, let's work together to eliminate them in the future." This first issue included notes on recent sporting events, as well as very mildly naughty jokes and gossip regarding several of the students.</abstract>
