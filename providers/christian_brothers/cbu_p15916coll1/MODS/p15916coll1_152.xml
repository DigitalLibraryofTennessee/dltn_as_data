  <abstract>During a reunion banquet held on March 26, 1914, it was decided to form an "Alumni Society" affiliated with Christian Brothers College in Memphis, Tennessee. With this form, Brother Maurelian invited all former students to submit their information to the College; it would then be forwarded to the new society president, Terence Wolfe, Jr., and its secretary, Bernard Shields.</abstract>
