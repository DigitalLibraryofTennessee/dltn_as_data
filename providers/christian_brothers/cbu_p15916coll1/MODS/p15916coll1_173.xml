  <abstract>President Brother Theodore Drahmann delivered this homily at the dedication of the Brother Miguel Faculty Courtyard behind Barry Hall. About Brother Miguel, he said: "I am convinced that his premier qualities of teacher - scholar - saint very simply but completely epitomize the ideal of the Christian Brother as educator - likewise the ideal of all the men and women who have joined the Brothers in our mission here at CBC - especially those who serve as faculty members."</abstract>
