  <abstract>"But Not Goodbye" was performed more than once at Christian Brothers College. The first time it was performed it was one of the pirate-ship plays of 1950-1951 that led to the adoption of the Buccaneer name for the mascot and the athletic teams. This particular production was from 1957.</abstract>
