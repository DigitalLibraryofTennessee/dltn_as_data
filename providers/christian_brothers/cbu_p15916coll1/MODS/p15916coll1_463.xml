  <abstract>Student-made posters advertised the Vietnam Moratorium student anti-war protest held in Memphis. Christian Brothers' student Leo Arnoult was the coordinator for the Memphis protest, which consisted of debates and forums on individual college campuses followed by a march from the Spanish American Memorial Park to the Overton Park Shell. More speeches and a performance by a folk group continued at the Shell.</abstract>
