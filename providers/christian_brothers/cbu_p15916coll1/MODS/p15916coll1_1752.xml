  <abstract>The Statue of the Virgin was erected in 1944, first standing near the entrance to Christian Brothers' campus. With the construction of Ave Maria Hall, the Statue was situated in a pool of shallow water, shown here in a blanket of snow. This particular shrine was dedicated in 1955, with a marker reading "From the class of 1944: to obtain the blessing of the Mother of God on all the boys who ever attend CBC."</abstract>
