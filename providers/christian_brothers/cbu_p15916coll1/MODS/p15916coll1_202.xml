  <abstract>Cast members of "Life With Father" were Joleta Conley, Helen Mayo, Betty Rost, Patsy O'Mara, Betty Griffin, June Rahm, Pat Fitzgerald, Jim Sheehan, Bill Dansby, Otto Wunder, Billy Moran, Clayton Cargile, Charles Nearn, and Jack Moran. Brother Roger directed. Look closely in the background for the pirate ship. Sitting atop the etagere, the ship used as a random prop in this and other plays in 1951. In tribute to "Pirates of Penzance," the ship was one of the elements around campus that led to the establishment of the Buccaneer as Christian Brothers' mascot.</abstract>
