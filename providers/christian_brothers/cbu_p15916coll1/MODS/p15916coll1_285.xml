  <abstract>The Physics classroom in the 1880s had experiments underway--on the left rear table was a Toepler-Holtz machine, designed to create significant electrical discharges. Among the apparatus in the glass case were vacuum tubes, bulbs, and "eggs" of various kinds, which were used in other electrical experiments.</abstract>
