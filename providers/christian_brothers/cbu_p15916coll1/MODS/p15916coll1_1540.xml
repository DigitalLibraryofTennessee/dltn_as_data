  <abstract>September 11, 1980 Dear Colleague: We would like to call your attention to a Draft Counseling Workshop which will be held on campus Saturday morning, September 27. Its purpose is to provide information about the registration process itself, about options available to young people, and about techniques of the kind of counseling which is supportive rather than directive. Young men born in 1962 will be require to register for the draft during the week of January 5-11, 1981. After that a man must register within 30 days of his 18th birthday. A number of CBC students who are 17 and 18 years old will be facing this prospect, and may well come to you for advice and information. As you probably know, the Supreme Court will take up the issue of registration of young women. It is expected to deal wilth this early in its fall term. If if decides affirmatively, CBC's young women students will then face the same prospects as our young men. The workshop on September 27 will be conducted by persons from the Draft Education and Counselting Coalition of Memphis. The coalition is an alliance of concerned groupd and citizens in the Mid-South area to provide assistance to anyone eligible to register for the military draft. There will be no charge for the workshop. In addition to the presentations outlined on teh enclosed schedule, literature will be available to take home to use at your discretion. If you ahve any questions about this, we would be happy to tray to answer them. Sincerely, Sister Christ Sister Chris Hucik, Director of Campus Minsitry Gerry Vanderhaar Gerard Vanderharr, Faculty Moderator, CBC Peace Fellowship</abstract>
