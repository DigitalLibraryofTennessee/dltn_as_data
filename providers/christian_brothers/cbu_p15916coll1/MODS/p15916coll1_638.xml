  <abstract>On the front are the courses set out for the three courses of study Christian Brothers College offered at the time--Academic/Scientific, Commercial, and Technical. Students in the commercial courses would take classes such as General Business, Typing, Business Law, and Bookkeeping. Technical students took Shop Drawing, Electricity, Mechanical Drawing, and Wood Shop. Academic-Scientific students were the only ones required to take Latin; it was an elective for commercial students but not offered to technical students. On the reverse is a photo of the gym, along with a description of the athletic facilities, including shuffleboard lanes and a boxing ring.</abstract>
