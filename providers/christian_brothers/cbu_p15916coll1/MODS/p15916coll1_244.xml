  <abstract>For over 40 years, Joe Nadicksbernd was a major part of Christian Brothers athletics, whether as a student athlete or a coach. From 1967-1971, he was a star player on the CBC baseball and basketball teams. He coached the basketball team from 1978-1982, which was followed by 25 years as baseball coach. He became Athletics Director in 2003, a position he held until his death in 2014.</abstract>
