  <abstract>The Christian Brothers College Mothers' Club was founded in 1929, its membership made up of the mothers of the high school students at the school. Most of the club's efforts went toward financial support of CBC, with fund-raising efforts that enabled the funding of seating in the Gymnasium, purchasing the Union Railroad's right of way, and building the Bell Tower, among other things.</abstract>
