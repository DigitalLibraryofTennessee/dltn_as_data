  <abstract>October 15, 1969 was Vietnam Moratorium Day, a nationwide educational effort to bring pressure on the government to end the Vietnam War. CBU student, Leo Arnoult, was the coordinator of the Memphis Moratorium Committee. It was a day of mourning for those who had died in the Vietnam conflict. In the morning, each campus conducted debates on the issues. At 1 pm, students from all schools and concerned Memphians assembled at the Spanish American War Park for a march to the Overton Park Shell, where speakers addressed the marchers that afternoon.</abstract>
