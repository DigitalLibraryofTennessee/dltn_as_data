  <abstract>The restoration of the college department of Christian Brothers College was proclaimed in this brochure. Since the discontinuation of the college programs at the time of World War I, CBC had functioned as a high school. With the construction of the new building on East Parkway, it was planned to reopenfreshmen college classes in 1940, with sophomore classes to be added in 1941. Courses offered in the first year were English, Math, Science, Language, and History. Tuition was $50.00 per quarter.</abstract>
