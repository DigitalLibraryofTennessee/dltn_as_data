  <abstract>The members of the Christian Brother College football team posed with Coach William "Fatty" McLain (standing at the right end of the middle row). The only other person identified ws Thomas L. Seals, who was in the center of the front row, holding the ball. These were the days when football was fairly unregulated, when any assemblage of males--regardless of age or weight--could form a team and play each other. Some were high schools; others were colleges. CBC was frequently " out-weighed."</abstract>
