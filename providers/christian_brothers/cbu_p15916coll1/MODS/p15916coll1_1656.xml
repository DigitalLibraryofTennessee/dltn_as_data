  <abstract>Over 80 years after the De La Salle Christian Brothers opened the doors of Christian Brothers College on Adams Street in downtown Memphis, they celebrated their move to 650 East Parkway South. The souvenir program for the dedication was an elaborate production with its magenta and gold cover. The building was renamed Kenrick Hall after the High School moved to its own campus on Walnut Grove in 1964.</abstract>
