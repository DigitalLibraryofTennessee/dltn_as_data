  <abstract>The ground-breaking for the Engineering Center was September 17, 1984. Construction was underway, when the Nolan bequest came to Christian Brothers. Bernadette Collicott Nolan willed a large tract of land to CBC with the desire that her husband, John Joseph Nolan be memorialized. CBC sold the land and used the funds to complete the Engineering Center, which was named in memory of the Nolans at its dedication in April, 1986.</abstract>
