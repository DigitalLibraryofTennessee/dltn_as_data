  <abstract>Jerry Bradshaw was the first Director of CBC's Computer Center. Although originally planned to be housed in Ave Maria Hall, the Computer Center needed more space and an addition to St. Joseph Hall was constructed. Equipment included the computer, keypunches, a card reader, and a printer. The Center rented time on the computer to Memphis area industry by the hour.</abstract>
