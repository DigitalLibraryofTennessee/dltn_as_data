  <abstract>Brother John Joseph McMahon served as director from 1916-1918. He was a specialist in the teaching of religion. With the threat of the Great War looming, Brother John Joseph had the science department overhauled. Focus was on technical courses--civil engineering and bacteriology. Students were being drafted, and there was some concern that the Brothers would be as well. The government ultimately decided that the Brothers fell into the same category as clergy, and so, deferred them.</abstract>
