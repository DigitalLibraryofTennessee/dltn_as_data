  <abstract>Brother Robert Staub was the second person to teach biology, starting in 1950, at Christian Brothers College. He became chairman of the department in 1959. The first biology degrees were awarded in 1961. Brother Robert received both his master's and doctoral degrees in ecology from the University of Minnesota at Minneapolis. By the time he retired in 2010, Brother Robert had worked at CBC/CBU for sixty years, the longest tenure of any of the Brothers.</abstract>
