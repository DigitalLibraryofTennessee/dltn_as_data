  <abstract>President Brother Theodore thanked opera singer, Marguerite Piazza, for changing for flight from San Francisco to be able to sing at the dedication of Buckman Hall. Marguerite Piazza was an American soprano of the mid-20th century. An early cross-over artist, she sang both opera and popular music. Born in New Orleans, she later lived in Memphis and was long a supporter of Christian Brothers College.</abstract>
