  <abstract>Although Brother Philip Morgan was teaching in Chicago at the time, in 1952 he was tasked with determining what it would take to establish an Electrical Engineering program at Christian Brothers College in Memphis. He was recruited to study electrical engineering and received his Bachelors in the field in 1954. He was then given the responsibility of organizing a Bachelor's level program for CBC. While setting up the program and its laboratories, he continued his studies, attaining a Masters in Electrical Engineering in 1968. He worked as a professor of electrical engineering at CBC, and later CBU, until he retired in 1995.</abstract>
