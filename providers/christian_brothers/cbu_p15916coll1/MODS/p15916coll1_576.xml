  <abstract>The Boiler House (also known as "The Fort" and later known as Battersby Hall) was built at the same time (1939-1940) as the original High School building on Christian Brothers College's East Parkway campus. Boiler equipment was on the first floor as well as a garage for the president's car. On the second floor were twelve residence rooms for the Brothers, with a shared shower and bathroom. Giant steam pipes ran through an underground tunnel connecting the Boiler House and the High School Building. Additionally, it provided a passageway that the Brothers used to traverse the campus.</abstract>
