  <abstract>Red Elm Park on Madison Avenue was a baseball field. CBC's Coach William "Fatty" McLain negotiated a deal with the Memphis area baseball association to use it for football, Red Elm being the prime location for sports in town at the time. Football practices and games were held there when baseball was not on the schedule.</abstract>
