  <abstract>Christian Brothers College assembled a band from its earliest days. The thirty students who were taking music lessons formed a 21-person band and a 24-person orchestra. The band quickly established itself at Memphis parades and events; one such was the dedication of the fountain in Court Square (commemorated in the inscription on the rim of the fountain). The first director was Professor Paul Schneider, a professional musician.</abstract>
