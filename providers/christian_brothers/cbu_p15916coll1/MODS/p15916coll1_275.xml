  <abstract>Coach William "Fatty" McLain posed for a photograph. McLain played football for Vanderbilt as a student before coming to Memphis to work with the Christian Brothers College team. He coached from 1910 through 1913, stopping his athletic career in order to attend to the business of his law firm. An innovative coach during the years that football's rules were evolving, he was well-regarded by his players and fellow coaches.</abstract>
