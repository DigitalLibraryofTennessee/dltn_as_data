  <abstract>Brothers Arthur Higgins and Bernard Murphy pose with Coach Tony Gagliano. Gagliano had been a student athlete during the 1930s when Brothers Arthur and Bernard were his coaches. He coached the CBHS baseball team from 1958-1964. In addition, he coached Memphis' American Legion baseball teams to 18 state championships in 20 years, winning the national title in 1968. This photo was taken before the final game in the Tennessee state Legion tournament of 1963.</abstract>
