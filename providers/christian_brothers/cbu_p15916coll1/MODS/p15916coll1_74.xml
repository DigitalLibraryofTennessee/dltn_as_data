  <abstract>The first Christian Brothers College building erected on the East Parkway campus was made to house the high school and administrative offices. Originally, it had 16 classrooms, a library and study hall, the cafeteria, labs for physics, chemistry, and biology plus a science lecture hall. There were plans to reopen a junior college. It was the first of four planned buildings (high school, Brothers' residence, chapel, and gym), all to be built of steel and concrete with red brick exteriors trimmed with stone. The style was known as collegiate Gothic architecture.</abstract>
