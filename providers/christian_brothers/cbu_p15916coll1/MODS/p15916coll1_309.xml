  <abstract>Brothers Hyacinth Richard Gerlach and Lambert Thomas Matthews shake hands on the East Parkway campus. Brother Hyacinth Richard's presidency was filled with activity. The Administration Building and the De La Salle Gymnasium were constructed, and the Union Railway was removed. Brother Lambert Thomas served as right-hand man to President Brother Hyacinth Richard, and succeeded him as president in 1953.</abstract>
