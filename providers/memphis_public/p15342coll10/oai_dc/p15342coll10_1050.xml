<dc:description>Caption: Hon. Isham G. Harris -- Bureau, Engraving &amp; Printing. -- Text on separate paper: Copied from the Courier Journal - Of all the men in the South in 1861 Isham G. Harris was best fitted for President of the Confederacy. Had he been chosen, history might have been very different. He would have been the Carnot of America. But the hand of God was in that mighty conflict, it seems that the battle was to the South, the champion to the North, but a montmorency like Harris might have changed the result. -- Henry Watterson, editor -- Courier Journal-</dc:description>
