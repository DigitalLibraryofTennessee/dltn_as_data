  <abstract>"Al Hirt, famed jazz trumpeter, will be in Memphis next week as a guest of Shelby County Mayor Bill Morris to investigate a possible permanent move here, Morris said. -- Hirt, who lived in Memphis in the 1940s, will visit the city Thursday through Saturday with an eye toward possibly using Memphis as a base for his performances. -- Morris said he was courting 'some degree of permanency' for Hirt in Memphis. Hirt recently shut down his famous nightclub in New Orleans' French Quarter, complaining of crime and other problems in the area. -- 'Al likes Memphis real well,' Morris said. 'He's going to take a look at some of the things that are happening here. We're going to show him the flavor, the example of great Memphis hospitality.' -- Some of that hospitality probably will include a visit to the Beale Street redevelopment project, which already has received commitments from entertainers Lou Rawls and Charlie Rich to open clubs there. Morris said Hirt and his party may visit The Peabody and a private home during their stay. -- Morris said hirt would be a 'great addition' to the Peabody's Skyway Room as a performer a few nights a week. Eventually, Morris said, he would like to see a national radio broadcast coming from the Skyway, similar to the one done during the big-band era. -- 'Al Hirt's name is known throughout the country,' Morris said. 'It could become a catalyst.'..."</abstract>

    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>A collection of all things Memphis... a little bit of this, a little bit of that. The M Files is a great place to find portraits and newspaper clippings, but also so much more. As the clippings from the Memphis Information File are digitized, they will be added to The M Files, but so will the smaller manuscript collections and most of the items used to create the topical digital displays in the Memphis Room. </abstract>
