  <abstract>“With a clarinet at his side, the musical score on his lap and his fans peeping through the dressing room door, Benny Goodman prepares for his concert – one of ‘thousands and thousands’ he has given during his life. -- But the ‘King of Swing,’ famed for his bands and his jazz and the sounds that have come from his clarinet for the past 40 years, said that each audience is a new challenge. -- ’I’m still breaking my leg,’ each time on stage, he said. ‘It’s still show business.’ -- And since Goodman is a living legend of sorts, known to music lovers as the subject of 1955’s ‘The Benny Goodman Story,’ he also has to put up with the little interferences that come with being a star. -- As he enters the concert hall, he is stopped for his autograph. As he studies and sings the music for the performance, admirers poke their heads into his dressing room.

      <title>The M Files</title>
    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>A collection of all things Memphis... a little bit of this, a little bit of that. The M Files is a great place to find portraits and newspaper clippings, but also so much more. As the clippings from the Memphis Information File are digitized, they will be added to The M Files, but so will the smaller manuscript collections and most of the items used to create the topical digital displays in the Memphis Room. </abstract>
