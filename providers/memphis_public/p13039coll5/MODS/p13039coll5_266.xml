  <abstract>"...Stamm, whose family is in the clothing business here, is a graduate of Snowden Junior High School and Central High School. Interested in jazz since he was 16, the 42-year-old artist lives with his wife and two daughters in the small town of Purdys, N.Y., about 50 miles from New York City. He drives into the city 'whenever I have to work' - which is often. -- Stamm makes his living doing studio work and plays enough club dates to make a pretty good living , he said, giving him the freedom to play jazz without financial pressures. -- 'Having this circumstance allows me a tremendous amount of freedom in the music that I play, and in my own ability to do what I like to do best, rather than having to please club owners and managers,' he said. -- The freedom Stamm talks about is the freedom to play jazz without sacrificing improvisational creativity for what is commercially successful, what will sell in the record stores or draw the biggest crowds. -- Stamm describes true jazz as an American art form 'based strictly on improvisation. It takes on many forms and shades of coloring and many styles. -- What is commonly called fusion jazz today is 'crossover' music, according to Stamm. 'It doesn't have the basic ingredient to any degree of depth that the basic roots of jazz has had all these years. There is not a tremendous amount of improvisation.'..."</abstract>

      <title>The M Files</title>
    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>A collection of all things Memphis... a little bit of this, a little bit of that. The M Files is a great place to find portraits and newspaper clippings, but also so much more. As the clippings from the Memphis Information File are digitized, they will be added to The M Files, but so will the smaller manuscript collections and most of the items used to create the topical digital displays in the Memphis Room. </abstract>
