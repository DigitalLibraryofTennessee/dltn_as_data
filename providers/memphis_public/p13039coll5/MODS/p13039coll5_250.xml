  <abstract>“He is a quiet man. -- We are sitting in a shadowed room, cut off from the street noises, the afternoon’s light barely creeping through a doorway window. -- An upright piano, framed with pictures and musical scores, waits patiently across the room. -- ’I’ve been playing that piano for almost 45 years,’ he says softly and points. That’s as many years as he’s been on Earth; he grew up on it, was weaned from it and still comes back to it. -- His mother, Mrs. Rose Newborn, sits on the piano bench, leaning. ‘These youngsters,’ says the one who ought to know, ‘They don’t even know about him. This is why a lot of them don’t know him, because he’s been out of town for so many years.’ -- But enough of them knew Phineas Newborn Jr. to show up at the Ritz last Sunday night to hear a son of Memphis play. Enough to call him back to the Ritz for shows at 9 and 11 p.m. tomorrow. It will be a replay, with Fred Ford on saxophone, Earl Thomas on bass and Jeff Grayer on drums. Newborn will also be featured on tomorrow’s weekly jazz program on WLYX (FM 89.3). The show airs from 12:30 to 5 p.m. -- Ford, who sometimes is a manager for Newborn, says his friend is called the ‘Spirit of Piano’ in Japan. -- People also call his ‘Fine-us,’ but Ford says it ‘Phin-ee-us’ and when his mother mentions ‘Junior’ they know who she means. -- Newborn says, ‘Yeah, Fine-us. My daddy started that. People who see it written out say Phin-ee-us, but he started calling me Fine-us.’…”</abstract>

      <title>The M Files</title>
    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>A collection of all things Memphis... a little bit of this, a little bit of that. The M Files is a great place to find portraits and newspaper clippings, but also so much more. As the clippings from the Memphis Information File are digitized, they will be added to The M Files, but so will the smaller manuscript collections and most of the items used to create the topical digital displays in the Memphis Room. </abstract>
