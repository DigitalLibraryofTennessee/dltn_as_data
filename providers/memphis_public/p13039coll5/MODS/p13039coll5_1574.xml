  <abstract>1911 Minutes stated that Mrs. Virginia Frazer Boyle gifted the unpainted plaster equestrian model to the N.B. Forrest UCV. This was the model that Virginia's mother, Letitia Frazer claimed was given to her by Charles Niehaus. The 1912 Minutes stated that another working model of the Forrest monument was acquired for the Tennessee Room at the Museum of the Confederacy by Mrs. Baker. This model which was painted to resemble unweathered bronze was sent to Mrs. Janet (Norman V.) Randolph by Charles Niehaus.</abstract>

      <title>The M Files</title>
    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>A collection of all things Memphis... a little bit of this, a little bit of that. The M Files is a great place to find portraits and newspaper clippings, but also so much more. As the clippings from the Memphis Information File are digitized, they will be added to The M Files, but so will the smaller manuscript collections and most of the items used to create the topical digital displays in the Memphis Room. </abstract>
