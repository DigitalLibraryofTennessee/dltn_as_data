  <abstract>The third episode of the Memphis Room Music Show, hosted by Eldon "Chip" Holliday. In this episode, Chip discusses the melting pot of Memphis' musical history and how it gave rise to one of the all-time great jazz pianists: Phineas Newborn Jr. Though little known today outside of jazz circles, in his prime Newborn was frequently compared to Art Tatum and Bud Powell while also being acknowledged as one of the most talented musicians working and recording.</abstract>

      <title>The M Files</title>
    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>A collection of all things Memphis... a little bit of this, a little bit of that. The M Files is a great place to find portraits and newspaper clippings, but also so much more. As the clippings from the Memphis Information File are digitized, they will be added to The M Files, but so will the smaller manuscript collections and most of the items used to create the topical digital displays in the Memphis Room. </abstract>
