  <abstract>"All that can be said about Lena Horne is what has been said so many times before-- she's an incredibly beautiful lady and an inimitable performer. -- Watching her show at the Orpheum last night made it hard to believe that she's 62-years old. -- Dressed in a flowing pinkish-orange caftan gown, Miss Horne walked onto the stage like a lady. But before her 1.5 hour performance ended, she had sung some sexy, sultry numbers - classics like 'Stormy Weather' and 'The Lady Is A Tramp,' songs from her movies, shaked her rump to the funk, 'rocked' to the floor and cut loose on her rendition of a song performed by Michael Jackson in the movie, 'The Wiz' - 'You Can't Win, You Can't Break Even and You Can't Get Out of the Game.' -- The 2,000 or so in the audience loved it and Miss Horne received several standing ovations. About halfway through the show, the indefatigable Miss Horne tied a white kerchief around her neck, 'to get rid of some of the sweating. I don't mind sweating, but it takes the color out of the costume,' she told the crowd, who responded with laughter and more applause. -- 'One of the great privileges of being a lady,' she told the crowd, 'is that a lady can be just as trashy as she wants when she wants. And I'm beginning to enjoy trash more and more each year. I'm what you call a late bloomer and I'm sorry I waited so long.'..."</abstract>

    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>A collection of all things Memphis... a little bit of this, a little bit of that. The M Files is a great place to find portraits and newspaper clippings, but also so much more. As the clippings from the Memphis Information File are digitized, they will be added to The M Files, but so will the smaller manuscript collections and most of the items used to create the topical digital displays in the Memphis Room. </abstract>
