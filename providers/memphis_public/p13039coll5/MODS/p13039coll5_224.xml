  <abstract>"Artists From Other Night Spots Use Free Time To Listen And Applaud New Organization - And There Is No Greater Praise -- Hottest jazz combination to come out of Memphis since Jimmie Lunceford's day is that six-piece outfit the gifted Jamae has put together under the name the Hi-Hatters down at the new Hi-Hat Club on Highway 61 south of Memphis. This sextet and its maestra are the musical talk of the town at the moment. -- Any Monday night, when the musicians at most of the other outlying spots are taking a rest, you can discover them assembled at the Hi-Hat for the privilege of listening to Jamae's inspired work at the piano and vibraphone, plus the support of her five fine sidemen. When one music-maker takes a free evening to listen to another, that's the ultimate tipoff as to the quality, and these Monday evening sessions just below that muchly-controverted bridge are nothing less than a tribute by fellow artists to a little lady who has no peers in the field hereabouts. -- When she was featured with the orchestra of her husband, Owen Elkins, Jamae always yearned for a chance to experiment with what hepcats call 'a small combo' of her own. Opening at the Hi-Hat gave her that opportunity. She got together Trumpeter Bix Corley, on of the village's better Gabriels; Clarinetist Joe Bracciante, member of a family steeped in the Memphis musical tradition for three generations; Guitarist Jerome Gilbert, Drummer Guyton Nunnally and Bassist Victor Danreuther. Sharing their mistress' enthusiasm, the boys plunged into rehearsal with a determination to come up with something fresh and distinctive. The results speak for themselves. Jamae and her Hi-Hatters are the treat of the Summer. -- The Hi-Hat also serves an excellent meal and stages a twice-nightly floor show, the highlight of which is Lynn Curtis' tap dancing with baton. The place is open every night in the week except Tuesday, from 5 in the afternoon until the wee sma' hours of the morn. -- Incidentally, Jamae has laughingly requested us to deny the rumors that her separation from the rotund Owen Elkins is something more than a mere professional parting. They are still quite happily married."</abstract>

      <title>The M Files</title>
    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>A collection of all things Memphis... a little bit of this, a little bit of that. The M Files is a great place to find portraits and newspaper clippings, but also so much more. As the clippings from the Memphis Information File are digitized, they will be added to The M Files, but so will the smaller manuscript collections and most of the items used to create the topical digital displays in the Memphis Room. </abstract>
