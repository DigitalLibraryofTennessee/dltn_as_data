  <abstract>Material in the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company Collection provides important information on the company that at one time was the largest manufacturer in Memphis, employing thousands of individuals working in a facility that covered several hundred acres in North Memphis. The parent company in Akron, Ohio, was founded in 1900 by Harvey S. Firestone, Sr., one of America's great business entrepreneurs. The Memphis Firestone plant was built in 1936 and incorporated the Murray Wood Products Company plant, which was owned by Fisher Body Corporation. This facility was the initial unit for the new Firestone tire manufacturing operation. Raymond C. Firestone, one of the founder's four sons, was transferred from California to head the operation of the Mid-South facility. The Memphis plant grew rapidly, soon out-producing its early goals, and the communities of Frayser and New Chicago were developed to provide homes near the Firestone operation for the company workforce. In 1956, the Firestone Company advertised its Memphis plant as the "largest single tire producing unit in the world on 35 acres of floor space, producing 1 out of every 17 tires manufactured in the U.S." The ad pointed out that the Memphis plant employed some 4, 000 men and women and contributed more than $25, 000, 000 annually to the local economy. Growth continued through the 60s and 70s, but the plant was forced to close in 1983. The collection includes one box of print materials and one large album of photographs, which depict all phases of tire manufacturing and production at the Memphis plant. In addition to the materials in this collection, the Memphis Information File contains more than one hundred newspaper clippings on the Firestone Company, and the Memphis Room Photograph Collection includes 34 photographs, many showing the initial 1936 construction. The Memphis Room also has bound copies of the company's annual reports from 1938 through 1973. This material provides an important historical record of the company's significant role in the economic history of Memphis. Materials in this collection were donated to the Public Library after the close-down phase of the Firestone plant had been completed.</abstract>

    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>A collection of all things Memphis... a little bit of this, a little bit of that. The M Files is a great place to find portraits and newspaper clippings, but also so much more. As the clippings from the Memphis Information File are digitized, they will be added to The M Files, but so will the smaller manuscript collections and most of the items used to create the topical digital displays in the Memphis Room. </abstract>
