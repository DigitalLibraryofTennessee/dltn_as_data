  <abstract>Title page includes: "Ellis, William D., ALS to Z. B. Oakes (Dated October 6, 1975, Misc. Mss. Ellis); Davis, H. Winter, ALS to William Pitt Fessenden (Dated February 3, 1863. Misc. Mss. Davis)." -- Summary of Preface and Introduction: Bolton, Dickens &amp; Company was the largest of the slave dealing businesses in Memphis as of 1860. The firm, which also sold cotton, had business houses in Richmond, Vicksburg, Mobile, Charleston, Lexington, Jefferson City and in Memphis - first at the corner of Adams and Main, and later on Adams between Second and Third. Brothers Wade and Isaac Bolton were in business together before Thomas Dickens became a partner, but the firm ran into legal and financial troubles that led to its ultimate decline. In 1857, Isaac Bolton shot and killed a Kentucky slave dealer. Although Bolton was eventually acquitted, the legal bill of $100,000 was paid from the company account, leading to more lawsuits and battles within the firm. Isaac died in 1864 and Wade was killed by partner Thomas Dickens on July 23, 1869. -- Pages 1-38 are a day-to-day accounting by Isaac Bolton for the months of March and April 1865. Pages 39-79 list the names of slaves, purchase prices, etc. Pages 80-91 include entries for sale of slaves. Pages 92-99 are transcriptions of correspondence and the last section includes newspaper articles and advertisements.</abstract>

      <title>The M Files</title>
    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>A collection of all things Memphis... a little bit of this, a little bit of that. The M Files is a great place to find portraits and newspaper clippings, but also so much more. As the clippings from the Memphis Information File are digitized, they will be added to The M Files, but so will the smaller manuscript collections and most of the items used to create the topical digital displays in the Memphis Room. </abstract>
