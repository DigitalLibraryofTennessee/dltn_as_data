  <abstract>"A first in film biography is being created in Memphis. -- It is the story of Memphis jazz musician Charles Lloyd, being filmed by Eric Sherman of Los Angeles, a Yale student. -- It all began when Mr. Sherman, a student of sociology with an interest in jazz, heard a concert by Mr. Lloyd at Town Hall in New York.

'It will be the first such film ever made,' he said yesterday. 'My father, Vincent Sherman, is a film director and I guess I've got it in my blood.' -- Mr. Lloyd, who is 29, is a 1956 graduate of Manassas High, the son of Mr. and Mrs. John L. Parker of 1082 Clarmont Circle. He received his bachelor's and master's degrees in music from the University of Southern California.

    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>A collection of all things Memphis... a little bit of this, a little bit of that. The M Files is a great place to find portraits and newspaper clippings, but also so much more. As the clippings from the Memphis Information File are digitized, they will be added to The M Files, but so will the smaller manuscript collections and most of the items used to create the topical digital displays in the Memphis Room. </abstract>
