  <abstract>"...About 550 people spent a lazy afternoon yesterday walking to the various stages and enjoying some fine jazz music from both out-of-town and local musicians. -- A busboy could be seen in the service area at No. 1 Beale Street dancing up a storm to the Buck Creek Band's version of a Bessie Smith song, 'Jazzbo Brown From Memphis Town.' A waitress at the same restaurant finally just gave in and danced as she brought food and drinks to her customers. -- Many of the crowd probably were pleasantly surprised that the music played at the festival wasn't strictly Dixieland. -- George 'Doc' Ryan, festival chairman, originator of the event and a cornet player in his Memphis band, The Hot Cotton Jazz Band, defined 'traditional jazz': 'It's the jazz that was developed in America between 1900 and 1939. It includes ragtime, the blues and Dixieland in several versions: Chicago, New Orleans and West Coast and some early swing of the 1930s. Dixieland is just one part of that.'..."</abstract>

      <title>The M Files</title>
    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>A collection of all things Memphis... a little bit of this, a little bit of that. The M Files is a great place to find portraits and newspaper clippings, but also so much more. As the clippings from the Memphis Information File are digitized, they will be added to The M Files, but so will the smaller manuscript collections and most of the items used to create the topical digital displays in the Memphis Room. </abstract>
