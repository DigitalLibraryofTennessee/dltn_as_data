  <abstract>"His Playing Is Called 'Exciting' - Many Refer to Him as 'Genius' -- Memphis, which gave to the jazz world such immortals as Handy, Lunceford and Bessie Smith, has another negro artist who has the jazz critics polishing up their best adjectives to describe his piano technique. -- Phineas Newborn Jr. is about to become famous nationally before Memphis is even aware of him. -- A month ago Fred Cook of WREC asked me, 'Is this Phineas Newborn who was on the Steve Allen show the same Phineas Newborn who used to play at the Plantation Inn over in West Memphis? He's real great.' I couldn't answer Fred's question then, but the answer is yes. -- Phineas has out a new album for Atlantic called 'Here Is Phineas.' Cook has been featuring two or three numbers from it each afternoon on his WREC radio program..."</abstract>

      <title>The M Files</title>
    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>A collection of all things Memphis... a little bit of this, a little bit of that. The M Files is a great place to find portraits and newspaper clippings, but also so much more. As the clippings from the Memphis Information File are digitized, they will be added to The M Files, but so will the smaller manuscript collections and most of the items used to create the topical digital displays in the Memphis Room. </abstract>
