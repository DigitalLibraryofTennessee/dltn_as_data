  <abstract>"The Cianciolo theatres are shown together here as part of an ad in 1995 announcing the construction of a new theatre in Whitehaven Plaza. That theatre was never completed, but a Whitehaven Cinema was constructed in 1966 by General Cinema and was twinned in 1973. Instead of a new theatre in Whitehaven, the southernmost suburb, a theatre was opened in Frayser, the northernmost suburb." - Caption from Vincent Astor's book, Memphis Movie Theatres.</abstract>

      <title>The M Files</title>
    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>A collection of all things Memphis... a little bit of this, a little bit of that. The M Files is a great place to find portraits and newspaper clippings, but also so much more. As the clippings from the Memphis Information File are digitized, they will be added to The M Files, but so will the smaller manuscript collections and most of the items used to create the topical digital displays in the Memphis Room. </abstract>
