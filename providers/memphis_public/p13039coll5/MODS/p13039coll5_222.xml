  <abstract>"In Six Months They Have Made More Than 850 Calls to the Ill -- ...He was talking about a registered nurse from the Visiting Nurse Association. In six months, more than 850 visits have been made in all parts of the city to all types of cases. Junior League is sponsor. -- ...Miss Mary Frances Ward, director of the association, says cancer, tuberculosis, diabetes and heart cases, in that order, are the most frequent occasions for visits. The association works closely with the West Tennessee Cancer Clinic. -- But the nurses handle everything from giving shots to small children exposed to measles to caring for an elderly lady with a broken hip. -- Visiting nurses thus fill an important gap in medical care, intensified by overcrowding of hospitals, burdens of extended illness and other cases requiring special attention but not hospitalization. -- ...All visits are made under direction of the family physician to persons of every economic status. Some 65 per cent pay full or part cost. But service without exceptions is available to all, regardless of ability to pay."</abstract>

      <title>The M Files</title>
    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>A collection of all things Memphis... a little bit of this, a little bit of that. The M Files is a great place to find portraits and newspaper clippings, but also so much more. As the clippings from the Memphis Information File are digitized, they will be added to The M Files, but so will the smaller manuscript collections and most of the items used to create the topical digital displays in the Memphis Room. </abstract>
