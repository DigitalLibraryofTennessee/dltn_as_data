  <abstract>"The world famous jazz orchestra of Jimmy Lunceford, top flight negro musician who died Saturday night in Seaside, Ore., was formed here by him in 1925 when he was teaching at Manassas High School. -- The body of the 47-year-old maestro will be buried here in the family plot at Elmwood after services in New York City. Arrangements are incomplete. -- Born in Mississippi-Lunceford, who was born James Melvin Lunceford in Fulton, Miss., collapsed in a music store late Saturday after complaining of severe headaches during the day. Coroner William Thompson said the death was due to natural causes. -- True to tradition, his band played its scheduled engagement an hour later. It was a one-night stand on a West Coast tour. Manager Eddie Rosenberg said the musicians would disband permanently after a memorial program at Rockaway Beach, Ore., Wednesday night. -- Still with the band was the piano player who was graduated in music along with Lunceford at Fisk University. They came here together in 1925 when Lunceford went to Manassas as music teacher and football coach, Ethel Tarpley of 1941 Felix, Lunceford's sister-in-law, recalled last night. -- She did not recall the pianist's name, but he served as the nucleus around which Lunceford, using Manassas students, built an organization destined to become internationally known. In 1937 the band toured 30 countries in Europe. -- Married Fisk Classmate -- After four years at Manassas, Lunceford gave up teaching to take his orchestra on the road. He returned to Memphis at intervals, and in 1934 he married Rose Chrystal Tulli, a teacher at Booker T. Washington High School, whom he had met at Fisk. They maintained a home in White Plains, N.Y. -- Lunceford, who started as a guitarist and later mastered the saxophone, clarinet, trombone and flute, was a licensed pilot. He flew his personal plane wherever he went, taking four of his musicians along in the five-place twin-engine Cessna. -- He was last here May 25 when he flew in from Nashville after playing for his fraternity, Kappa Alpha Psi."</abstract>

    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>A collection of all things Memphis... a little bit of this, a little bit of that. The M Files is a great place to find portraits and newspaper clippings, but also so much more. As the clippings from the Memphis Information File are digitized, they will be added to The M Files, but so will the smaller manuscript collections and most of the items used to create the topical digital displays in the Memphis Room. </abstract>
