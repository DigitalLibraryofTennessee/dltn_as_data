  <abstract>"Founder Of Nurses' School In Memphis - One of Tennessee's most colorful personalities and who had contributed much to the progress of medicine and research, died last night in Knoxville, Tenn. She was Mrs. Lena A. Warner, founder of the school of nursing at old Memphis General Hospital (now John Gaston). Mrs. Warner had a distinguished career as student, wife, Army nurse, doctor, research scientist, bacteriologist, lecturer, health crusader and organizer. She had lived in Knoxville for the past 35 years and died in a nursing home there after a long illness.

      <title>The M Files</title>
    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>A collection of all things Memphis... a little bit of this, a little bit of that. The M Files is a great place to find portraits and newspaper clippings, but also so much more. As the clippings from the Memphis Information File are digitized, they will be added to The M Files, but so will the smaller manuscript collections and most of the items used to create the topical digital displays in the Memphis Room. </abstract>
