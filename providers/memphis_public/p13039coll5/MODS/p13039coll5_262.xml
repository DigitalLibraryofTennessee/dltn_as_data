  <abstract>"When George Coleman, Harold Mabern and Frank Strozier bring home their internationally known jazz music this weekend, they also will bring memories of why they had to leave Memphis to seek fame and fortune. -- The Manassas High School graduates are headliners at the Beale Street Music Festival, being held in the downtown area that was all too familiar to them and other serious musicians during their growing-up years in the 1950s. -- The three, who will play as a trio Saturday and Sunday afternoon, all now live in New York City. They left Memphis for Chicago after high school. -- Coleman, alto and tenor saxophonist, talked plainly about his reasons for leaving: -- 'The jazz opportunities in Memphis are limited. During the time when we first began to play as kids in high school, there were not a lot of jazz outlets. The Hotel Mitchell, 'Sunbeam' Mitchell's club, was known by a lot of people and musicians as a good place to sit in and have a jam session. -- 'It was a learning process for all of us during that time,' he said. 'There is no more of that.' -- Coleman said the late 1940s and 1950s produced a lot of good Memphis talent. 'It seems like after we left, the trend sort of shifted to rock and to rhythm and blues. -- 'New York is the Mecca,' Coleman said in a telephone interview from his home in Manhattan. 'Everything is here. All the jazz clubs are here. It has more jazz clubs than any place in the world. Any of the innovative processes involving jazz always begin here. -- 'Anybody who wants to get ahead and get established always has to come to New York.' -- Pianist Mabern said perfection of the craft is a prerequisite to fame. Memphis did not offer that opportunity, he said. -- 'The reason why most of the guys left Memphis is because as great as it is, learning about rhythm and blues and the environment, we had to move on to further our careers.' -- This weekend will mark one of the many times the trio has played together. They played several times with the jazz group MJT+3 in Chicago. They now play together occasionally in New York with Coleman's quartet. They all have played and recorded with some of the biggest names in the jazz world, including Wes Montgomery, Miles Davis and Max Roach. -- Mabern's plans to study at the Chicago Conservatory, where Strozier and Coleman studied, were cut short because he had no money. -- 'In Memphis we had quality, but not quantity. In Chicago, they had 10 great piano players on every corner,' Mabern said."</abstract>

    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>A collection of all things Memphis... a little bit of this, a little bit of that. The M Files is a great place to find portraits and newspaper clippings, but also so much more. As the clippings from the Memphis Information File are digitized, they will be added to The M Files, but so will the smaller manuscript collections and most of the items used to create the topical digital displays in the Memphis Room. </abstract>
