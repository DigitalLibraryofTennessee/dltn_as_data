  <abstract>"Saxophonist-flutist Frank Strozier, whose credits include playing with Miles Davis, Woody Shaw and Shelley Manne, returns to Memphis tonight for a rare appearance in his hometown. He will play Schreier Auditorium of the University of Tennessee Student/Alumni Center at 800 Madison at 7 p.m. -- The show is the first in a series of 'Homecoming Concerts' planned by M.M.U.S.I.C. (Memphis Musicians United Supporting Improvisational Creativity), a nonprofit group dedicated to fostering jazz. -- Strozier was born in Memphis in 1937 and began studying piano at the age of 11, switching to alto sax two years later. In 1954, he moved north and continued his studies at the Conservatory in Chicago. While there he became a member of the MJT+3 group, and when that band broke up in '59, Strozier moved on to New York. -- After a couple of years with Roy Haynes and stints with other jazzmen, he signed on for a '63 tour with Miles Davis, and in '65 moved to California at the insistence of drummer Shelley Manne. Strozier remained out west for six years and was a regular in the drummer's club, Shelley's Manne Hole, as well as getting into studio work and television shows. -- In '71 he returned to New York and took a day job in the school system (he taught science). Meanwhile, he continued sitting in with other musicians and doing his own one-nighters. -- Also in '71, Strozier was picked by down beat magazine's poll of critics as the talent deserving wider recognition. -- Throughout his career, Strozier has recorded with Manne, Hayes, Don Ellis, Woody Shaw, Chet Baker, McCoy Tyner and a number of other jazz artists, and he also has done a number of albums on his own, including Remember Me in '76 and What's Goin On in '77. -- Strozier's standing in the jazz community is evidenced by the six-hour tribute that a New York radio station paid to him and his music last May."</abstract>

    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>A collection of all things Memphis... a little bit of this, a little bit of that. The M Files is a great place to find portraits and newspaper clippings, but also so much more. As the clippings from the Memphis Information File are digitized, they will be added to The M Files, but so will the smaller manuscript collections and most of the items used to create the topical digital displays in the Memphis Room. </abstract>
