In 1968 the Memphis bash, say those involved, will join the ranks of the St. Louis and Ohio Valley jazz festivals. -- The first Memphis Jazz Festival had 6,000 fans by the ear for over four hours at the Mid-South Coliseum. -- They were all there - a handful of hippies, Flower Children, numerous miniskirted lasses; and what counts most, the many people who simply 'dig' the sounds. -- They came for one purpose - to hear the giants, the Cannonball Adderley Quintet; Herbie Mann and Octet; songstress Nina Simone; Ramsey Louis and hist Trio; the man with the canted horn, Dizzie Gillespie and his quintet; and the incomparable organist, Jimmy Smith, and his trio..."</abstract>

    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>A collection of all things Memphis... a little bit of this, a little bit of that. The M Files is a great place to find portraits and newspaper clippings, but also so much more. As the clippings from the Memphis Information File are digitized, they will be added to The M Files, but so will the smaller manuscript collections and most of the items used to create the topical digital displays in the Memphis Room. </abstract>
