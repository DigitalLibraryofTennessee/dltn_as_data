  <abstract>"It's Been Years Since We've Had Any -- On Monday Memphis will have for the first time since the mid-1920's a full-scale, organized visiting nurse service for individuals and families. -- It is the product of two years of work by the Junior League. Their Follies of 1950 and the Junior League cook book provided most of the $30,000 to start the project. -- The Visiting Nurse Association starts off in a leased building--a one-time rooming house--at 1080 Madison with a director and two staff nurses." -- Photo caption at top reads: "Visiting Nurses in smart blue uniforms with work kits packed to start off from Visiting Nurse Association headquarters. Mrs. Reba Forrest (left) and Mrs. Lois Hollomon will begin a service in Memphis Monday which every other city about our size, 1100 in all, already has. Creators of VNA hope the case load will be so heavy that staff expansion will be necessary." -- Bottom caption reads: "Miss Mary Frances Ward, director of VNA, comes from Atlanta Branch of the University of Georgia where she was assciate professor of nursing education."</abstract>

    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>A collection of all things Memphis... a little bit of this, a little bit of that. The M Files is a great place to find portraits and newspaper clippings, but also so much more. As the clippings from the Memphis Information File are digitized, they will be added to The M Files, but so will the smaller manuscript collections and most of the items used to create the topical digital displays in the Memphis Room. </abstract>
