<dc:description>"Some 1,100 sanitation workers, members of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, honored the firefighters' picket lines and refused to report for work today. AFSCME officials said the workers will continue to honor the pickets and predicted more city and county employees will be affected as the firefighters increase their pickets. These workers were at the substation on Democrat Road."</dc:description>
