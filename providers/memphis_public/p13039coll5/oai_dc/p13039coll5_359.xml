<dc:title>"How Dizzy That Frog Must Be!"</dc:title>
<dc:subject>aviation; Harbin, Emma; 1930s;</dc:subject>
<dc:description>"Promised to a thousand admirers and trophy hunters, the little green frog showing white in the picture attached to the right pocket of the jacket worn by Mrs. Emma M. Harbin, the 'Dixie Eagle,' has looped more loops and spun more spins that any frog alive. -- Mrs. Harbin's luckpiece, that has accompanied her on stunting expeditions all over the country, will be with her tomorrow afternoon when she takes part in the first annual 'Fall Air Festival' sponsored by the Dixie Aviation Club at Municipal Airport. -- Her 'part' will consist of some of the most dangerous stunt flying on the program and including balloon bursting, twin ribbon cutting, bomb dropping, flying her place across the field on one wheel and her usual repertoire of single, double and triple inside loops, spins, Immelman turns and dare-devil serial acrobatics."</dc:description>
