<dc:description>"Las Savell, director of public relations at Methodist Hospital, holds a groundbreaking shovel as nurses say a prayer before ceremonies began at the new site for the hospital's School of Nursing.  Since the school was founded in 1921 it has graduated 1,290 registered nurses.  The new school will accommodate 250 students and will be capable of graduating 75 nurses a year, more than twice the present potential."</dc:description>
