<dc:description>"A new Dixieland group - with 220 years of musical experience - makes its professional bow at the Sharecropper from 6 to 9 today. -- The River City Six is led by Emil Orth, former trombonist for Bob Scobey's great Dixieland bunch.  He has made previous Sunday appearances at the Sharecropper, but he wanted to play some true, commercial Dixieland."</dc:description>
