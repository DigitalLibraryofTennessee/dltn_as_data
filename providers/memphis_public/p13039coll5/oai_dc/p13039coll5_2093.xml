<dc:description>"Richard L. Pinner, president of the Shelby County Sheriffs' Association, far right, talks with picketing policemen at Police Headquarters downtown. Sheriffs' deputies did not cross picket lines set up this morning at the deputies' substation at 5705 Shelby Oaks Drive. However, deputies continued to work when non-union officers crossed the lines and brought cars and equipment to the officers."</dc:description>
