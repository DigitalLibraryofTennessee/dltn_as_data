<dc:title>"Gillespie Stuns MSU Audience With Virtuosity"</dc:title>
<dc:subject>Gillespie, Dizzy; jazz; music; 1970s;</dc:subject>
<dc:description>"Dizzy Gillespie is described by many musicians as 'the greatest trumpet player in the world.'  He also is a splendid comedian, a fine blues singer and a master of the conga drum. -- By himself, he is a rare artist who commands the respect of the musical world and mesmerizes audiences around the world. -- Throw in the other three members of the Gillespie Quartet and you have a concert that reaches to the depth of the soul and makes it difficult - if not impossible - for the star's admirers to remain still during a performance. -- Last night's concert at Memphis State's University Center ballroom, highlighting MSU's Jazz Week, was an excellent example of what Dizzy Gillespie is all about...."</dc:description>
