<dc:description>"Jazz pianist William 'Count' Basie enjoyed popularity in Memphis for more than three decades, but times have changed considerably for black entertainers since the musician played his first gig on Beale Street. -- Matty Brescia, a retired agent who said he booked a number of black entertainers in town years ago, said Basie, who died Thursday in Hollywood, Fla., at age 79, signed a contract to appear at the old Beale Street Auditorium in December 1951. -- 'When I booked Count Basie, you couldn't book a Negro entertainer into a white auditorium,' Brescia said. 'Then they wouldn't let white people in.  My wife, who worked the box office, and I were the only white people there and there were about 1,000.  The place was packed.  But he told me he was proud to play Beale Street for his people.' -- Brescia said admission for the dance was $1.50.  Basie agreed to play for $500, with $100 down. -- The musician, known for his upbeat swing style and compositions such as 'One O'Clock Jump,' 'Jumpin' at the Woodside' and 'Don't You Miss Your Baby?' last played town at The Peabody on Oct. 28. -- But the prices have gone up.  The tickets were priced at $20 and $25, and neither show at the Skyway was filled to capacity."</dc:description>
