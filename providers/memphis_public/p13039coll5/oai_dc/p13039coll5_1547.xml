<dc:title>Forrest Monument Addendum -- Revised working model</dc:title>
<dc:subject>Forrest, Nathan Bedford; Forrest monument; Forrest Park; Niehaus, Charles H.; statues;</dc:subject>
<dc:description>A photograph of the model at the Pink Palace Museum.  When this model arrived at the Museum of the Confederacy in Richmond, VA, in 1911, King Phillip's tail was not attached so it could be crated and shipped. Charles Niehaus told Mrs. Janet (Norman V.) Randolph that sculptors in Richmond could easily attach the tail properly, but there is some damage to the tail. This model was insured.</dc:description>
