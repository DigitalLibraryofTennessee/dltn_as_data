<dc:title>"Downtown jazzed up by festival"</dc:title>
<dc:subject>jazz; Memphis Traditional Jazz Festival; music; 1980s;</dc:subject>
<dc:description>"...About 550 people spent a lazy afternoon yesterday walking to the various stages and enjoying some fine jazz music from both out-of-town and local musicians. -- A busboy could be seen in the service area at No. 1 Beale Street dancing up a storm to the Buck Creek Band's version of a Bessie Smith song, 'Jazzbo Brown From Memphis Town.'  A waitress at the same restaurant finally just gave in and danced as she brought food and drinks to her customers. -- Many of the crowd probably were pleasantly surprised that the music played at the festival wasn't strictly Dixieland. -- George 'Doc' Ryan, festival chairman, originator of the event and a cornet player in his Memphis band, The Hot Cotton Jazz Band, defined 'traditional jazz': 'It's the jazz that was developed in America between 1900 and 1939.  It includes ragtime, the blues and Dixieland in several versions: Chicago, New Orleans and West Coast and some early swing of the 1930s.  Dixieland is just one part of that.'..."</dc:description>
