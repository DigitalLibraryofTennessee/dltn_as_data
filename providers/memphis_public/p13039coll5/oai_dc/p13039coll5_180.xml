<dc:description>"50 YEARS AGO - Dec. 9, 1934 - For the first time since the General Hospital was founded in 1898, a woman intern will tread the halls of the institution in the line of duty.  Next April 1, following her graduation from the University of Tennessee, pretty 22-year-old Martha Lou Hefley will drop the 'Miss' from her name to become Dr. Hefley.  Her duties at the General will include all those performed by the men, and she expects to take advantage of every opportunity in preparing herself to become a specialist in obstetrics."</dc:description>
