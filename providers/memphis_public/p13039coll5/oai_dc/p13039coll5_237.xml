<dc:description>"...Voice inflections weren't perfect, for the African tribal song was born 5,000 miles away. -- But Central High School band director James Harris, a Negro, seemed to feel the cowbell he was tapping and Mrs. Henrietta Boggs, Carver Junior High music teacher, made the piano suffice for bongos. -- Dr. Darius L. Thieme blew upon his bamboo flute and Leon Johnson shook his maracas.  Both men make black music their study in a federally funded program at Fisk University in Nashville. -- And yesterday in Central's auditorium, the city school teachers of music sang 'E je ko-mode ko wa o' and learned about the concept of 'black music in culture.' -- They were also scolded by Dr. Thieme, project director of Fisk's black studies in music, for being the caboose on the end of a long train. -- In the past few years, charges have been made not only that textbooks lie about the Negro's roles in history but also that credit for inspiring the blues, acid rock and cool jazz has been denied Negroes. -- Music teachers, the session concluded, could take the lead in giving credit where credit is due..."</dc:description>
