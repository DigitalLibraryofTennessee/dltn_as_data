<dc:description>"The Cianciolo theatres are shown together here as part of an ad in 1995 announcing the construction of a new theatre in Whitehaven Plaza.  That theatre was never completed, but a Whitehaven Cinema was constructed in 1966 by General Cinema and was twinned in 1973. Instead of a new theatre in Whitehaven, the southernmost suburb, a theatre was opened in Frayser, the northernmost suburb." - Caption from Vincent Astor's book, Memphis Movie Theatres.</dc:description>
