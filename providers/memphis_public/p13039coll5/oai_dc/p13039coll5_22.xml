<dc:description>An early photo of one of the seven original buildings on the Rhodes College campus.  It was originally the home of campus engineer John Rollow and his family.  Until recently, the building was used as the alumni office of the school, but currently it houses the Mike Curb Institute for Music.  The street in the background is University Parkway.</dc:description>
