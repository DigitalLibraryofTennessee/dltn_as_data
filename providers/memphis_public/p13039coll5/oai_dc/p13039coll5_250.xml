<dc:description>&#8220;He is a quiet man. -- We are sitting in a shadowed room, cut off from the street noises, the afternoon&#8217;s light barely creeping through a doorway window. -- An upright piano, framed with pictures and musical scores, waits patiently across the room. -- &#8217;I&#8217;ve been playing that piano for almost 45 years,&#8217; he says softly and points. That&#8217;s as many years as he&#8217;s been on Earth; he grew up on it, was weaned from it and still comes back to it. -- His mother, Mrs. Rose Newborn, sits on the piano bench, leaning.  &#8216;These youngsters,&#8217; says the one who ought to know, &#8216;They don&#8217;t even know about him.  This is why a lot of them don&#8217;t know him, because he&#8217;s been out of town for so many years.&#8217; -- But enough of them knew Phineas Newborn Jr. to show up at the Ritz last Sunday night to hear a son of Memphis play.  Enough to call him back to the Ritz for shows at 9 and 11 p.m. tomorrow.  It will be a replay, with Fred Ford on saxophone, Earl Thomas on bass and Jeff Grayer on drums.  Newborn will also be featured on tomorrow&#8217;s weekly jazz program on WLYX (FM 89.3).  The show airs from 12:30 to 5 p.m. -- Ford, who sometimes is a manager for Newborn, says his friend is called the &#8216;Spirit of Piano&#8217; in Japan. -- People also call his &#8216;Fine-us,&#8217; but Ford says it &#8216;Phin-ee-us&#8217; and when his mother mentions &#8216;Junior&#8217; they know who she means. -- Newborn says, &#8216;Yeah, Fine-us.  My daddy started that.  People who see it written out say Phin-ee-us, but he started calling me Fine-us.&#8217;&#8230;&#8221;</dc:description>
