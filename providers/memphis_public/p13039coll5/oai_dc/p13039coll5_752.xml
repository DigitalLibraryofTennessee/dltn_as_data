<dc:description>From WYPL Radio: "We are pleased to honor WYPL volunteer reader Rorie Trammel (shown bottom row, right) -- Rorie was a second year students at Memphis State University in the fall of 1980 and in the pledge class for Delta Sigma Theta Sorority.  As a pledge project, a group of 17 young ladies volunteered to read for the West Tennessee Talking Library (now WYPL) for one month.  There are 16 of the ladies in the picture. -- The group is planning a reunion in 2012. We hope they will stop by for a visit and to see our progress after 31 years.  Rorie was a volunteer on and off for a number of years after the class project and has been a permanent reader at WYPL since October 5, 2006. -- Thank you, Rorie!"</dc:description>
