<dc:description>"Bill Mobley had the chance to be a biologist, a researcher or a dentist.  And with his education, he could have done any number of other things in the science or health care fields. -- His love of music kept him from entering either of these lucrative fields. -- Although Mobley, 28, spent almost 10 years at several universities, music was always in the back of his mind. -- Except for some occasional practice, Mobley said, he virtually put away his trumpet for the 10 years he attended Southwestern at Memphis, the University of California at Los Angeles and the University of Tennessee Center for Health Sciences. -- It was during his second year in dental school in Memphis, however, that Mobley decided to make music his career. -- 'I just felt that I had to be a musician,' he said. 'And when you become one you have to be ready to give up a certain amount of security.' -- Fortunately for jazz fans, Mobley chose to give up financial security and take his chances in music. -- During the past several years, he has met with some success. -- He has maintained a jazz quintet which performs frequently in clubs around Memphis, including a seven month stint last year at the Varsity Inn before jazz was phased out there..."</dc:description>
