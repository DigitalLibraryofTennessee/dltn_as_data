<dc:title>"Performance By Ellington Fills 'Happiness' With Joy"</dc:title>
<dc:subject>Ellington, Duke; jazz; Le Bonheur; music; 1960s;</dc:subject>
<dc:description>"In a half-century as a performing artist, Duke Ellington may never have played on a  worse piano.  He may never have had a smaller nor younger audience - so young that they probably did not know who Duke Ellington was. -- But his little concert last night for a half-dozen patients of Le Bonheur Children's Hospital had a warmth that went beyond the overheated room in the basement of the hospital with the name that means, with what must often be a cruel irony, 'happiness.' -- 'If you have a perfect piano, you have no alibi,' said Mr. Ellington, at 69, going on 70, one of the elder statesmen of American music.  With grace and ease and some care he sat on the bench before an old upright, while one of the women who had arranged his hospital visit said in a polite gasp, 'Oh, I knew the piano was not in good shape but I didn't know the top was off the seat.'"</dc:description>
