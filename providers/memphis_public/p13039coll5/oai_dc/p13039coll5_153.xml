<dc:description>"Ben L. Hooks, Negro attorney and minister, yesterday was appointed by Gov. Frank G. Clement as judge of the newly-created Division IV of Shelby County Criminal Court.  The post will be the highest judicial position ever attained by a Negro in Tennessee.  Dr. Robert White, state historian in Nashville, said no Negro reached a post this high during the Reconstruction era.  Mr. Hooks, 40, said yesterday he will accept the appointment, effective Sept. 1... 'All I could say is I do think it is a great advancement for me personally, but more for the race,' Mr. Hooks said."</dc:description>
