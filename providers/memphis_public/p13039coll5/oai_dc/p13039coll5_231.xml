<dc:title>"1,500 Were One O'Clock Jumping"</dc:title>
<dc:subject>Basie, William "Count"; jazz; music; 1960s;</dc:subject>
<dc:description>"When stocky Bill (Count) Basie sits down behind his piano, he seems to grow a foot.  If his reception at the Club Paradise is any indication, he has a Memphis following to match his musical stature. -- An estimated 1,500 fans gathered last night to hear 'the Count' and his 17-piece band.  Few went away disappointed. -- Author of a seemingly endless list of all-time favorites including the immortal 'One O'Clock Jump,' Basie demonstrated his inimitable keyboard artistry until well into the morning hours. -- AN INTERVIEW -- What about rock and roll - would he play it? -- 'You're damned right I would, in a minute, if I had the feeling for it,' said Basie in an interview. 'But the kids around my house say they've got 'Big Daddy' - they've tried to teach me the beat of the stuff but I just don't seem to catch it.' -- STUDIO MONEY -- Basie said that, other than the 'gimmick stuff for the teen-agers,' the big money for musicians today is to be found 'around the studios,' playing for movies television and recording. -- 'It's pretty hard these days to find and keep top-notch side men,' he said.  'Usually the studios snatch up the really great side men - that's where the money is and you can't blame a man for not staying around home.' -- 'Big Daddy' recalled one of his trips to the Bluff City when the big bands were swinging in Memphis. -- PLAYED AT HANDY -- 'I can remember when I met one of the greatest entertainers in show business, Sammy Davis Jr.,' he said.  'I was playing at the Handy Theater on the same bill with the Will Maston Trio.  Davis was a part of the Maston Trio and I was highly impressed by him. -- 'I thought people should see this kid.  So I took him with me to the Strand Theater (in New York) and after that he never really looked back.  He really wrecked that theater.'"</dc:description>
