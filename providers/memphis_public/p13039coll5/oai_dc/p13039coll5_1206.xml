<dc:subject>Forrest, Nathan Bedford; Forrest monument; Forrest Park; statues;</dc:subject>
<dc:description>Leather ledger book containing 157 pages of entries regarding the funding, design, execution, and installation of the Gen. N.B. Forrest equestrian statue in Forrest Park. -- Some pages were blank, missing from the binding, or were cut from the ledger. -- Only pages with entries, letters, or newspaper clippings attached were scanned.  -- Note: Judge John Preston Young, the Monument Association Secretary, did not record minutes in the ledger in chronological order.  Judge Young began recording minutes dating from 1894 to 1905, added 1905 newspaper clippings, skipped over many blank pages, and then started over again beginning with 1898 and ending with 1905.</dc:description>
