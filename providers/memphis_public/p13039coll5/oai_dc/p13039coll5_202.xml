<dc:title>"Demand For Nurses Critically Exceeds Supply; Marriage One Big Reason"</dc:title>
<dc:subject>medicine; nursing; women; 1960s;</dc:subject>
<dc:description>"...There are many reasons why the R.N. is disappearing from the bedside of patients.  Basically, it is because not enough young women are entering the profession, not enough are being graduated. -- In recent years, recruitment has increased and there are more women (430,000) in nursing today than 10 years ago.  But demand continually outruns the supply. -- Where do the nurses go?  Dan Cupid strikes the first blow.  More than 30 per cent annually drop out of school, primarily because of marriage, or marry after graduation.  They go off to raise families and their services are lost to the profession a number of years." -- Caption reads: "Common Goal - When these senior students are graduated from the Baptist Hospital School of Nursing, they will be fitted for a lifetime profession which offers rapidly growing opportunities or progress.  Miss Nancy Powell (left) of Hayti, Mo., Miss Betty Lee (center) of Paragould, Ark., and Miss Sarah Sudbeck of Lexington, Miss., and their classmates are studying obstetrical nursing here."</dc:description>
