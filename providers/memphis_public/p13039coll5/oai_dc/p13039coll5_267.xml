<dc:description>"Jazz is not a music readily identifiable with Memphis, as are blues, rock and roll and soul.  Finding jazz in a local club requires patience and often the luck to be there on the right night. -- That's remarkable, considering the number of great players that have come out of Memphis: Phineas Newborn, Jr., his brother Calvin, Hank Crawford, Jamil Nasser, Jimmy Jones, Fred Ford, George Coleman, Frank Strozier... The existence of a Memphis jazz fraternity - though its members are spread around - can be seen on Harold Mabern's late-'60s album for Prestige, Workin' &amp; Wailin'.  His group on the record features George Coleman; the songs include 'Blues for Phineas' and 'Strozier's Mode.' -- An event next Sunday, Dec. 20, will focus considerable attention on the jazz heritage of this area as four pianists join forces for the 'Memphis Piano Summit': Newborn, Mabern, Charles Thomas and James Williams. -- The credentials are impressive. Newborn is recognized as perhaps the most creative pianist in contemporary jazz; Mabern has fronted his own groups and has played with Lee Morgan, George Benson and Freddie Hubbard; Williams has taught at Berklee College of Music in Boston and recently finished a long stint with Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers; Thomas has played with Mercer Ellington and is one of those musicians that other players are always talking about...."</dc:description>
