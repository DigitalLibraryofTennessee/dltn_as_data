<dc:description>"The first of 52 Filipino nurses being brought to Memphis to help ease a critical shortage at City of Memphis Hospitals will arrive here March 22, CMH officials said today. -- Twenty-one male and female nurses will be in the first group, hospital officials reported.  More will arrive April 1 and arrivals will continue until a total of 52 is reached. -- Jerry Novak, assistant administrator at CMH, said the nurses will receive language training and an intensive orientation program to supplement the schooling they received for the bachelor of nursing degrees in The Philippines. -- They must take state examinations before they can practice as registered nurses, he said. -- The nurses temporarily will be housed in the Marcus Haase Residence in the City of Memphis Hospital complex. -- CMH officials announced last fall the hospital would import nurses from The Philippines because of a shortage of almost 200 registered nurses at the hospital complex. -- Wheeler Lipes, CMH administrator, said the shortage has resulted from the hospital having to offer starting salaries of less than $700 a month to registered nurses, while other Memphis hospitals start RNs at more than $700."</dc:description>
