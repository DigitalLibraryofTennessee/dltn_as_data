<dc:description>"YO-YO HEMLINES were out and no options allowed for students at Methodist Hospital School of Nursing in 1928.  This photo, which recently was found at the hospital, shows the 54 students that fall wearing uniforms in the midi-length - a word which was unheard of in that era and had to wait another 40-plus years to be coined by fashion authorities.  Except for one nonconformist, all wore the regulation black stockings that were characteristic of the modesty of that time.  All the would-be Florence Nightingales who posed on the hospital lawn were stiffly starched, with caps at a primary proper angle and hemlines an unvarying 9 inches from the ground.  This might have been more becoming for a tall girl and less so for a short one, but the physique of the wearer was not taken into consideration. 'The rigid regulation,' said Las Savell, director of public relations for the hospital, 'stipulated the hemline had to be exactly 9 inches from the ground, whether the student wore flat heels or Cuban heels.'"</dc:description>
