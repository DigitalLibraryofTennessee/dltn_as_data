<dc:title>Charles Henry Niehaus and the Forrest Monument</dc:title>
<dc:subject>Forrest, Nathan Bedford; Forrest monument; Forrest Park; Niehaus, Charles H.; statues;</dc:subject>
<dc:description>This is a collection of letters, photographs, newspaper articles and entries made in the Forrest Monument Association Minutes Book, in chronological order, pertaining to the funding, design, execution, and installation of the Gen. N.B. Forrest equestrian statue in Forrest Park. The design phase began with the awarding of the contract to sculptor Charles Henry Niehaus in 1901.  Niehaus's tireless effort to create a statue befitting the "Wizard of the Saddle" is a worthy story which unfolds in this collection. Some pages of the minutes book were missing or were cut from the book, so there will be gaps in time.  This collection would not have been possible without the contributions of many individuals who cherish history and art.</dc:description>
