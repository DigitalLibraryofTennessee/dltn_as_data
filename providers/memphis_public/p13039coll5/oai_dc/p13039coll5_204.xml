<dc:description>"CAP TALK - These four women illustrate different levels of the professional nurse, from freshman student to RN.  They are (left to right) Miss Fran Ellis of Fort Smith, Ark., senior who wears full stripe on cap; Miss Pam Senteney of Weiner, Ark., junior student with a 'hash mark' across the corner; Miss Sandra Brim of Middleton, Tenn., a freshman who wears no cap until after the first year of study; and Miss Linda Gibbs of 3678 Knottingham, registered nurse with the plain white cap.  All are at Methodist Hospital."</dc:description>
