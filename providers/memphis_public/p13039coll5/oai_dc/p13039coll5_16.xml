<dc:title>Elvis honored by Jaycees</dc:title>
<dc:subject>Presley, Elvis; Jaycees; Bush, George H. W.; 1970s;</dc:subject>
<dc:description>"In sartorial splendor, with diamond rings on all fingers of his left hand, Elvis Presley accepts an award as one of the National Jaycees' 10 Most Outstanding Young Men in America.  The Jaycees wound up their national congress over the weekend.  Each recipient of the award made public comments and answered questions in private on subjects of special interest to the Jaycees. Principal address at the awards luncheon was given by UN Ambassador-appointee George Bush, who called upon all Americans to 'work within the system' while advocating new ideas and 'never resort to violence.'" NOTE: Clipping mounted to card stock.</dc:description>
