<dc:description>"City of Memphis Hospital officials today said they will meet Thursday with a group of Filipino nurses who want to transfer to hospitals in other parts of the country. -- During the past year, 101 Filipino nurses have been brought to the hospital to ease a nurse shortage, the hospital paying $620 in recruiting fees for each nurse. -- The nurses are bound to CMH by one-year work visas, most of which will expire by the end of April. -- Immigration authorities here said many of the nurses are hoping to transfer to warmer climates, especially California, where there are more Filipino men. -- Wheeler L. Lipes, administrator, said he opposes the transfers because he does not want Memphis to become a 'supply source and distribution point' for Filipino nurses.  Immigration officials, however, said the hospital has little hold on the nurses after the 12 month visas expire."</dc:description>
