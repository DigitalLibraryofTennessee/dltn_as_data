<dc:description>"'SATCHMO' RECALLS: Louis Armstrong, the giant of jazz who died in July at age 71, was smoking marijuana as far back as 40 years ago and maintained a lifelong respect for the drug as a 'sort of medicine' even though he later quit using it, a new biography says.  'We always looked at pot--marijuana--as a sort of medicine, a cheap drunk and with much better though than one that's full of liquor,' said Armstrong in letters to British music writer Max Jones and trumpeter John Chilton, old friends and authors of 'Louis.'  'Satchmo' spent nine days in a California jail before marijuana possession charges were dropped against him in 1931.  he was arrested the following year in Memphis but he says he smoked the incriminating cigaret in his cell and 'demolished the evidence.'"</dc:description>
