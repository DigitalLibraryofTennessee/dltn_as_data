<dc:description>Memo from Lamar Wallis to Wassell Randolph: "Dear Mr. Randolph: First I thought I would let this whole matter drop where it was, but after thinking it over I thought I should write the attached letter to show Ed Russell that I have no sympathy with the opposing side in any way. -- I have no idea what prompted him to say what he did this morning, and I am perfectly willing to forget it so long as I get this into the records. Sincerely,"</dc:description>
