<dc:description>A report submitted by Mary T. Haley on Sept. 29, 1958 about an incident that occurred a week earlier. -- Monday evening, Sept. 22, 1958   Time: approx. 7:30 P.M. -- 4 Negroes, 3 male, 1 female, high school or college age, came into the library at Peabody and McLean. -- They went straight to the Card Catalog, pulled out a drawer and started to check for the information they wanted. -- I walked over from the Return Desk and asked the boy who was checking on one side of the Alcove: May I help you?  He said he was looking for a book on the life of Pestalozzi. -- I told him it would be necessary for him to get his books from the Vance Ave. Branch; to make his request to Mrs. Oates and she would get the book for him. -- He asked how long it would take.  The reply: usually the day after the request is made. -- He then wanted to know if they could listen to records in the music room.  The reply: You know that you cannot use the music room. -- Ques.: Can we take the records out?  Ans.:  No, you may not. None of the Branches may borrow records, since the Record Collection is set up for borrowers who come to this branch. -- Ques.: The can we browse around.  Ans.: No. -- I then approached the other three and asked: -- And what do you want? The girl replied: Flaubert's Madame Bovary. -- To the same question, the next boy replied: Einstein's Out of my Later Years. -- The third boy's reply to this question was that he didn't want a book. -- I told them I would make a note of their requests and if the books were in, send them to the Vance Ave. Branch where they could get them after noon the next day. -- They left the library. -- A week later the books had not been asked for at the Vance Branch. -- Mary T. Haley -- Sept. 29, 1958"</dc:description>
