<dc:description>Letter from librarian Jesse Cunningham to E. M. Hall: "Dear Mr. Hall: I remember our conversation had some time ago about library integration, and I appreciate your interest at the time and your additional interest resulting in your nice letter of August 16.  The Library Board is definitely committed to the continuance of our policy in the matter which has existed all through the existence of our public library system.  Of course, with a Supreme Court like we have in this country most anything can happen.  Thank you for your good wishes.  Yours sincerely, J. Cunningham."</dc:description>
