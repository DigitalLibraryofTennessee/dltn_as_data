<dc:description>A letter from attorney Edward P. Russell to library board president Wassell Randolph: "The plaintiff's attorneys have not yet filed their statement of costs as required by the Federal Rules and may not do so for an indefinite time, if ever.  Until filed there is no cost bill for the defendants to pay.  Under the circumstances I think we should let the matter drift until plaintiff's attorneys take the appropriate action. -- Herewith, in blank, our statement for legal services.  Please fix the amount thereof as you and your associates may think proper. -- I am greatly pleased to have been associated with you and the other Trustees in this litigation though the results were not as we would have liked for them to have been. -- Sincerely yours, Edward P. Russell"</dc:description>
