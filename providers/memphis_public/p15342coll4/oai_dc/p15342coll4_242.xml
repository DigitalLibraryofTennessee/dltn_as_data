<dc:description>A copy of a letter from library board president Wassell Randolph to attorneys Russell, Creson and Montedonico: "Gentlemen: -- The Board of Directors of Cossitt Library have resolved that in view of the city ordinance requiring separate  rest room facilities to be provided for the races in public buildings they desire in the above case that you request of the court permission to amend the answer of the defendants and set up the city ordinance as an additional defense to this suit.  The Board desires, if possible, to have this issue determined by the court on the evidence that can be introduced. -- Cordially yours, -- Wassell Randolph, President"</dc:description>
