<dc:description>Letter from Library Director Lamar Wallis to Reverend Eugene Luening, president of the Memphis chapter of the Tennessee Council on Human Relations: "Dear Mr. Leuning: Thank you for your letter of December 14 concerning the desegregation of the Public Library's services and facilities.  As you have probably read, we are now caught between a City Ordinance requiring separate rest rooms and the NAACP, who want the use of the same facilities throughout the building.  This joint use of the same rest room seems to be the most sensitive point in the whole integration picture up to this moment, and I am not at all sure what the outcome will be in the matter of human relations. -- Sine [sic] the City Commission is not willing to repeal the City Ordinance, the Library Board has entered the ordinance as a defense in the NAACP lawsuit against the library. -- If you happen to have on hand any information concerning the use of rest rooms in other southern communities, I shall be pleased to hear about it.  Sincerely,"</dc:description>
