<dc:description>Copy of a letter sent by Wassell Randolph to Commissioner Loeb: "Dear Commissioner Loeb: -- You have read in the newspapers where Jesse H. Turner, Negro, has filed suit against Memphis Public Library in the United States District Court here.  At a meeting of the Directors of the library held yesterday a resolution was adopted, copy of which has been sent to the Mayor, requesting the City Commission at its next meeting to direct Mr. Frank B. Gianotti, City Attorney, and his legal staff to defend this action on behalf of all the defendants.  We hope that the City Commission will grant this request. -- Cordially yours, -- President"</dc:description>
