<dc:description>Several men looking through the 600s and 700s at the annual book sale.  Note on Back: "Another cooperative effort of the library and the Friends group: Book Sales, held twice a year since 1971, have netted over $34,000 for the Friends.  The money has provided much needed equipment, plus such 'frills' as paid newspaper advertising, draperies, area carpets, picture framing, potted plants, etc."</dc:description>
