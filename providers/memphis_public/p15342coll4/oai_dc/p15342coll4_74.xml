Text: ENJOYING FREE LIBRARY BOOKS -- PRESENT NEGRO PUBLIC LIBRARY -- The Vance Avenue Library, opened in the summer of 1939, serves the purpose of a central library for colored people in the same manner as the Cossitt Library at Front and Monroe serves the white people.  From this main library on Vance, it is hoped to extend a network of libraries for negroes.</dc:description>
