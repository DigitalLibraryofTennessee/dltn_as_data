<dc:description>E.M. Hall, a broker of fruits, vegetables and produce wrote this letter to head librarian Jesse Cunningham: "Dear Mr. Cunningham: I have not taken the time to call or write you commending you on your stand on the mixing of the races for Library use.  I did call you when this issue was first raised but I did want to tell you again that I did and still do appreciate the stand that you and the Board have taken in the matter. -- I do feel that we must maintain our position and feelings in this and while I have not publicly and actively done my part in the past, I am determined to do whatever small or large that I can in the present and future. -- We have most all sat idley [sic] by, assuring ourselves that such would never happen but it has and is going to more unless we all express ourselves at the polls and at every opportunity.  The NAACP and others are pressing harder every day and we must endeavor to resist. -- I am sure that most all White People want the Library facilities maintained as they are and I feel that we should so express ourselves. -- Wishing for you and the Board complete vindication and assuring your of my support, remain -- Yours very truly, E M Hall"</dc:description>
