<dc:description>"Dear Mr. West [sic], -- We have tried to find any information available concerning the use of rest rooms in public facilities in other southern communities, as you suggested in your letter of December 16th. [sic] to me as president of the local shapter [sic] of the Tennessee Council on Human Relations. -- We have written to the southern Regional Council.  They had no information about this problem.  They suggested a southern law reporting service.  I do not have the reference for that organizations [sic] correct name and address; we are still looking! -- Sincerely, -- Eugene A. Luening"</dc:description>
