<dc:description>Note on Back: "September was a very busy 'Faulkner Festival' at Memphis/Shelby County Public Library and Information Center.  Beginning with an extensive exhibit of Faulkner photographs, first editions and print collectibles along with an autograph party for Jack Cofield, author of a new photo-biography, the offerings also included films, slide talks, discussion of literary contribution, television and radio programs. Pictured here are Jack Cofield and Helen Karpinski of the Library's Films and Community TV Department."</dc:description>
