<dc:description>Letter from Lamar Wallis to Mr. Edward P. Russell, Sr. of Canada, Russell and Turner: "Dear Ed: I congratulate you on your astute handling of our case in federal court.  With proof that was admittedly weak you maneuvered with admirable skill to avoid an adverse decision. -- I write this letter lest there remain in your mind the faintest doubt that I have been sympathetic with your efforts and those of the Board in the rest room case.  If somewhere you got the impression that the case annoyed me or that I felt that the lawyers were merely arguing 'fiddle-dee' and 'fiddle-dum,' I have deep reason to regret it, for such is not the case. -- I think we will all admit that the weight of court decisions against our cause is almost overwhelming, but I have never recommended to the Board that we abandon all resistance.  My position is that of carrying out their wishes with cheerful cooperation, and that I shall continue to do.  My personal stand on all of these matters is one of moderation, but I have a personal dislike for the methods of the NAACP and am perfectly willing to do battle as the Board directs. -- An anonymous letter from a Negro who opposed the NAACP informed me two years ago that it was being told by supporters of the plaintiff in our case that I cam to Memphis from Richmond expressly to see to the desegregation of the Memphis Public Library.  Nothing could be further from the truth. -- My sympathy is with legal resistance, and I assure you that I am at your service so long as the litigation continues. Sincerely yours, C. Lamar Wallis"</dc:description>
