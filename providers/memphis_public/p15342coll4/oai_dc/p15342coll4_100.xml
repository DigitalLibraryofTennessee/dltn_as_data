<dc:description>Letter from Eugene Luening, president of the local chapter of the Tennessee Council on Human Relations, to Lamar Wallis, director of the Memphis Public Library: "Dear Mr. Wallis: We would like to commend you and the Board of Trustees of the Library for the quiet and effective way in which the facilities of our public library were opened to all our citizens.  It is our hope, of course, that all public facilities in the libraries as well as elsewhere will be as peacefully made available to all. -- If we can be of help at any time please call on us.  With correspondents in other Tennessee and Southern communities, we may have information available that could be of assistance.  Yours Sincerely, Tennessee Council on Human Relations, Memphis &amp; Shelby County Chapter by (Rev.) Eugene A. Luening"</dc:description>
