  <abstract>Letter from Lamar Wallis to Mr. Edward P. Russell, Sr. of Canada, Russell and Turner: "Dear Ed: I congratulate you on your astute handling of our case in federal court. With proof that was admittedly weak you maneuvered with admirable skill to avoid an adverse decision. -- I write this letter lest there remain in your mind the faintest doubt that I have been sympathetic with your efforts and those of the Board in the rest room case. If somewhere you got the impression that the case annoyed me or that I felt that the lawyers were merely arguing 'fiddle-dee' and 'fiddle-dum,' I have deep reason to regret it, for such is not the case. -- I think we will all admit that the weight of court decisions against our cause is almost overwhelming, but I have never recommended to the Board that we abandon all resistance. My position is that of carrying out their wishes with cheerful cooperation, and that I shall continue to do. My personal stand on all of these matters is one of moderation, but I have a personal dislike for the methods of the NAACP and am perfectly willing to do battle as the Board directs. -- An anonymous letter from a Negro who opposed the NAACP informed me two years ago that it was being told by supporters of the plaintiff in our case that I cam to Memphis from Richmond expressly to see to the desegregation of the Memphis Public Library. Nothing could be further from the truth. -- My sympathy is with legal resistance, and I assure you that I am at your service so long as the litigation continues. Sincerely yours, C. Lamar Wallis"</abstract>

    <abstract>The Benjamin L. Hooks Central Library is the largest facility in the Memphis Public Library and Information Center system. Although opened in 2001, the history of Memphis Public began in the 1880s when the city received a $75,000 gift from the estate of merchant Frederick Cossitt to build a public library in honor of the city where he made his fortune. A section of public land near the Mississippi River was donated by City government who agreed to provide operating expenses for the library. With the promise of city funds it was decided that the entire $75,000 would be used for construction of the library building. As a result of this decision Architect L. B. Wheeler designed an elaborate Romanesque red sandstone building which opened on April 12, 1893....</abstract>
