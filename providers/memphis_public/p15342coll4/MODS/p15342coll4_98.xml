  <abstract>Letter from Library Director Lamar Wallis to Mayor Loeb and City Commissioners: "Gentlemen: At its regular meeting today the Memphis Public Library Board of Directors instructed me to ask the City Commission to meet with the Library Board on Monday, November 21, at 11 a.m. in the Cossitt Library auditorium at 33 South Front. -- The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the question of restroom facilities in the various public library buildings. The negro plaintiff in our current lawsuit has refused to withdraw his suit on the basis that the Library Board has not desegregated all of its facilities, namely the toilets. The Library Board is complying with the City building code by maintaining separate toilet facilities for white and colored and would like to have the City Commission's feeling about this matter. Judge Miller has granted a thirty day period for the Library Board to answer the plaintiff. -- Since we have completely desegregated all library services and facilities except the restrooms, there will be no need to discuss any other matters except this one point, and therefore the meeting should not take long. Sincerely yours, C. Lamar Wallis, Director"</abstract>

    <abstract>The Benjamin L. Hooks Central Library is the largest facility in the Memphis Public Library and Information Center system. Although opened in 2001, the history of Memphis Public began in the 1880s when the city received a $75,000 gift from the estate of merchant Frederick Cossitt to build a public library in honor of the city where he made his fortune. A section of public land near the Mississippi River was donated by City government who agreed to provide operating expenses for the library. With the promise of city funds it was decided that the entire $75,000 would be used for construction of the library building. As a result of this decision Architect L. B. Wheeler designed an elaborate Romanesque red sandstone building which opened on April 12, 1893....</abstract>
