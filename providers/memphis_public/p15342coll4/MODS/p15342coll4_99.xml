  <abstract>Letter from Library Director Lamar Wallis to Reverend Eugene Luening, president of the Memphis chapter of the Tennessee Council on Human Relations: "Dear Mr. Leuning: Thank you for your letter of December 14 concerning the desegregation of the Public Library's services and facilities. As you have probably read, we are now caught between a City Ordinance requiring separate rest rooms and the NAACP, who want the use of the same facilities throughout the building. This joint use of the same rest room seems to be the most sensitive point in the whole integration picture up to this moment, and I am not at all sure what the outcome will be in the matter of human relations. -- Sine [sic] the City Commission is not willing to repeal the City Ordinance, the Library Board has entered the ordinance as a defense in the NAACP lawsuit against the library. -- If you happen to have on hand any information concerning the use of rest rooms in other southern communities, I shall be pleased to hear about it. Sincerely,"</abstract>

    <abstract>The Benjamin L. Hooks Central Library is the largest facility in the Memphis Public Library and Information Center system. Although opened in 2001, the history of Memphis Public began in the 1880s when the city received a $75,000 gift from the estate of merchant Frederick Cossitt to build a public library in honor of the city where he made his fortune. A section of public land near the Mississippi River was donated by City government who agreed to provide operating expenses for the library. With the promise of city funds it was decided that the entire $75,000 would be used for construction of the library building. As a result of this decision Architect L. B. Wheeler designed an elaborate Romanesque red sandstone building which opened on April 12, 1893....</abstract>
