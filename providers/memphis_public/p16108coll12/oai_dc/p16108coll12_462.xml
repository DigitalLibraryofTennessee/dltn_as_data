<dc:description>"25 YEARS AGO - June 15, 1960 -- A. J. Davies handed over the presidency of the Memphis Chamber of Commerce yesterday to Edward B. LeMaster, urging all Memphians to 'take on a little more braggadocio and tell the world about your fine city.' The new president is head of the realty firm of Edward LeMaster Co. Inc. Le Master will be at the helm of one of the fifty largest Chambers of Commerce in the United States. The Memphis chamber now has a membership of 2,300, largest in its 100-year history. One of the greatest challenges facing Memphis, Davies said, is the establishment of industries here to use the raw products of the Mid-South. LeMaster has been associated with chamber work for two decades. He was a director in 1947-48, vice president in 1953-54 and has had several committee assignments."</dc:description>
