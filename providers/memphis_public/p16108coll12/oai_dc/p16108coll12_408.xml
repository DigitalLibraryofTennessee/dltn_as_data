<dc:description>1970s Film Log

&#8220;Old Man River lapping, ever lapping, and then rolling away gently to the sea.  Long before 1541, when DeSoto stood upon our bluff and discovered the Mississippi River, the indians plowed the stream in their canoes and coaxed the fish from their water of temples and killed wild game on its banks.  Memphis knows nothing of the river&#8217;s infancy, of that far-away time when it started to flow down to the sea. Long before the coming of the railroads, the Mississippi River was the main artery of travel.  The ways of the old south swept down the river. Passengers by the thousands landed at the foot of Beale Street.  There was music then and dancing down there by night.  There is to be found most of the romance and adventure that made the river famous.&#8221;

&#8220;Memphis has one of the largest hospital complexes in the country. It&#8217;s a very important part of the city. All of the facilities and equipment are impressive, but the important thing is what we are actually doing.  It&#8217;s being able to let a child live, to relieve someone&#8217;s pain, or to learn something that will give someone a new and a better life.  That&#8217;s the important thing. People, that&#8217;s why we are here.  We are thousands, working together in an atmosphere of healing, learning and hope. It&#8217;s really a beautiful thing.&#8221;

&#8220;Why they&#8217;ve never written some sonnet or song about the Cotton Carnival will never be known.  For this is mother nature&#8217;s brightest stage - Memphis in May.  Sometimes the moments we count or the times we remember best are not the highlights of the season.  It might be a quiet crowd of two.  Or a small, familiar clan exploring a gourmet&#8217;s work by candlelight.&#8221;

&#8220;Schools are important for everybody - for the community and the whole society - but most of all for the individual.  The schools are basically just buildings, but with the people they come alive. It&#8217;s a new generation every year, a step toward a new awareness and a bringing of people together. It&#8217;s a good thing all around.&#8221;

&#8220;Today a bright new recording center, Memphis presents fine music to the world. It&#8217;s a long way from W. C. Handy to Elvis Presley, but the Memphis sound is big enough for all. The Memphis Music Awards annually honor outstanding musicians who have contributed to the music of Memphis.&#8221;  [George W. Lee speech excerpt from awards - May, 1971: &#8220;I accept this in the name of a gorgeous and melodramatic figure, who looked across to the Arkansas side of the Mississippi River and saw the gorgeous evening sunset in russet [unintelligible], and a song rose in his heart.&#8221;]  &#8220;In the program are celebrated artists, such as B.J. Thomas, Dionne Warwick, and Isaac Hayes.  Styles vary widely, from the genesis of the blues to the rock-and-roll and rhythm and blues of today.  You can&#8217;t help but want to move with it.  Ask Rufus Thomas.&#8221;
