<dc:description>Article from the Bygone Days section of the Commercial Appeal in 1985.</dc:description>
<dc:description>"125 YEARS AGO - April 20, 1860 -- Chamber of Commerce. The board of commerce of this association have contracted for the fine room on the north side of Court Square, on the second story of a new building going up there. The location is an excellent one. The room will be ready on the 1st of August, when the Chamber will go into actual operation. The committee on arbitration and appeals is, however, now ready for business, whenever any case may be referred to them. The prospects of the Chamber are most encouraging."</dc:description>
