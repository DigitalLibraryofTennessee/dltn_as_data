<dc:title>Overton Park Japanese Garden with Pond</dc:title>
<dc:description>"Japanese Garden, Overton Park, Memphis, Tenn." Color image of garden with lily pond at the forefront.</dc:description>
<dc:description>"Like a corner of the Orient dropped down into the midst of the Occident, the Japanese Garden with its lily pond at Overton Park, is a vivid splotch of color. It is as fragrant as it is lovely. Children and grown-ups like to gather here to watch the water-fowl disport themselves. -- gift of Mrs. Nell Gaffney"</dc:description>
