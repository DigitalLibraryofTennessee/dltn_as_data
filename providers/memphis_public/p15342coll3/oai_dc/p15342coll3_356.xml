<dc:description>&#8220;Goodwyn Institute -- May 17 1957 -- Institute -- Birthplace of the &#8216;Blues&#8217; -- Beale Street Memphis -- It was in a back corner of Pee Wee&#8217;s Place on a night in 1909 that W.C. Handy tuned up his band and wailed out the first &#8216;Blues&#8217; ever to be written. He&#8217;d written it for a hot political campaign and named it the &#8216;Mr. Crump&#8217; song. Mr. Crump won the election and Handy rode on his song from Beale to Broadway. Later changed to the &#8216;Memphis Blues,&#8217; a flood of rhythm went pulsating across the country, to Paris, to Singapore. W.C. Handy had given to the world the &#8216;Blues&#8217; &#8230; the child born of his genius in a back corner of PeeWee&#8217;s Place on Beale Street.&#8221;</dc:description>
