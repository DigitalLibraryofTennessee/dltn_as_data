<dc:description>"Mrs. Maria S. Ellis -- 739 Madison St. -- Clarksville -- Tenn. -- Dear Mrs. Ellis, -- Did you reach home safely? -- We had a most delightful time in -- Chatt. We three girls went together, -- did not care to stay with the other -- bunch. Did you find a bracelet -- in your room? The night I came -- in (Fri.) I took off my jewelery (?) some -- in your room and some in mine. -- Well, anyway I got to the train and my -- bracelet was not on my arm so thought -- I left it in the room. Have not found it -- among my things. -- Barbara Leronin -- 1133 E. Moreland."</dc:description>
