<dc:description>Memphis Press-Scimitar newspaper clipping showing flood refugees waiting for transportation to Memphis.  "These refugees are waiting on the highway for a truck or bus to come by and take them to Memphis.  They were rescued by boats yesterday from the flooded lowlands near Tomato, Ark.  Tomato is about 12 miles southeast of Blytheville, in Mississippi County.  Located right on the river, it is one of several small communities in Northeast Arkansas at the mercy of the raging Mississippi."</dc:description>
