<dc:description>Benjamin Hooks poses with four unidentified men and a plaque commemorating the NAACP National Headquarters.  The plaque reads: "For 77 years the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People was housed in New York City where it rented office space in more than 7 different locations. In 1977, the Board of Directors approved a proposal to investigate the feasibility of purchasing a permanent home for the NAACP. -- In 1985, the Board approved the purchase of this building as the permanent home for the NAACP. A formal dedication was held October 16-19, 1986. -- The building was purchased under the leadership of Benjamin L. Hooks, Executive Director. Officers were Kelly M. Alexander, Sr. who served as Chairman until his death in 1985. William F. Gibson succeeded him as Chairman, Jesse M. Turner, Treasurer, and Enola P. McMillan, National President. -- The NAACP expresses appreciation to its staff, particularly Reverend Jerry M. Guess and J. Howard Henderson for their untiring efforts, sacrifice and dedication toward the culmination of the move and renovation of our national headquarters."</dc:description>
