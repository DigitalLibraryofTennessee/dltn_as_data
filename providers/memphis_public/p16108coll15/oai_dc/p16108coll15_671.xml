<dc:description>Note on back reads, "On Wednesday, April 15, 1987, at the New York Hilton, Dr. Benjamin L. Hooks, Executive Director of the NAACP, held a press conference to unveil the Association's plans to investigate the lack of blacks in front office positions in baseball, basketball, and football.  Dr. Hooks met with 20 representatives of NAACP branches located in cities with major league franchises. The branches will request meetings with the owners of the professional teams in their city in order to formulate strategies on how to increase more black representation in managerial positions. In the rear, NAACP staff looks on. From left to right are Mrs. Enolia McMillan, president; Howard Henderson, Director of Administration; Hazel Dukes, President of the New York State Conference; and William Penn, Director of Branch and Field Services."</dc:description>
