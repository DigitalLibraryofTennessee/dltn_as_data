  <abstract>Benjamin Hooks poses with four unidentified men and a plaque commemorating the NAACP National Headquarters. The plaque reads: "For 77 years the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People was housed in New York City where it rented office space in more than 7 different locations. In 1977, the Board of Directors approved a proposal to investigate the feasibility of purchasing a permanent home for the NAACP. -- In 1985, the Board approved the purchase of this building as the permanent home for the NAACP. A formal dedication was held October 16-19, 1986. -- The building was purchased under the leadership of Benjamin L. Hooks, Executive Director. Officers were Kelly M. Alexander, Sr. who served as Chairman until his death in 1985. William F. Gibson succeeded him as Chairman, Jesse M. Turner, Treasurer, and Enola P. McMillan, National President. -- The NAACP expresses appreciation to its staff, particularly Reverend Jerry M. Guess and J. Howard Henderson for their untiring efforts, sacrifice and dedication toward the culmination of the move and renovation of our national headquarters."</abstract>

    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>Civil rights pioneer Benjamin Lawson Hooks was born in Memphis on January 31, 1925. A graduate of Howard University and DePaul University Law School, Hooks practiced law in Memphis and in 1965 became the first African American Criminal Court Judge in Shelby County. Hooks was also the first African American to serve on the Federal Communications Commission when he was appointed by President Richard M. Nixon in 1972. Elected executive director of the NAACP in 1977, Hooks led that venerable civil rights organization until his retirement in 1993. In recognition of his dedicated public service, the Benjamin L. Hooks Central Library was named in his honor on October 27, 2005. Two years later, on November 5, 2007, President George W. Bush awarded him the Medal of Freedom for being "a calm yet forceful voice for fairness, opportunity and personal responsibility."</abstract>
