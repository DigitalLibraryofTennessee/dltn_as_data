<dc:title>Gladys Brown Webb - letter</dc:title>
<dc:subject>correspondence; 1930s; Webb, Gladys Brown;</dc:subject>
<dc:description>"Friday May (June 6,) 1930 -- Dear Miss Brown: 
This day marks the climax of your high school career and I hope that you have not anything, but pleasant memories of your stay here. As I've watched your activities I have thought of you as a very splendid girl with many possibilities. Gladys, remember that you, yourself can only hinder you from reaching the pinnacle of your ambitions. As a departing word, I would say smile and the whole world smiles with you, but frown and you frown alone. -- Lovingly yours, Dara E. Todd -- 633 So -- Me--</dc:description>
